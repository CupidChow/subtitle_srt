=Episode 24=

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=Rong Zelan's Eloquence Stuns the Court=

4
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,720
Shouldn't you be in the Dragon Pavilion

5
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,480
speaking with
the Princess Consort and others?

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,080
Why are you here alone
enjoying the scenery?

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,160
The flower fragrance here is refreshing,

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,840
most suitable for calming the mind.

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,920
Attendant Rong,

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,440
you've risen step by step.

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,800
Now you're favored by many.

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,240
I'd like

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,800
to give you a heads-up.

14
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,000
In the palace,

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,440
those who

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,000
scheme and overreach

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,840
never end up well.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,040
What about Su Ye?

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,760
Did she overreach?

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,000
A third-class medical attendant

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,680
was beaten to death only because

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,520
she stained your clothes.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
What about Her Highness?

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,240
Did she overreach?

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,200
She had a premature delivery
for no reason.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,520
Someone has to

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,360
unravel these doubts.

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,400
Your tongue is even sharper
than your mother's.

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,920
But I wonder

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,000
if you can outlive her as well.

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,560
Your Grace, I'm flattered.

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,360
I will strive to live a little longer.

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,480
I believe

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,680
that justice will be done.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Take Lord Feng for an example.

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,400
He was fine a while ago,

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,880
yet he suddenly got executed.

38
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,960
It reminds me of the saying,

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,120
"God is always watching you,

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,880
and retribution will

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,040
eventually come."

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
You must've heard of

43
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,600
a medical attendant named Rong Zelan.

44
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,560
She once controlled
the spread of the plague.

45
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,680
Empress Dowager,

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,640
Princess Consort,

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,930
and Princess

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,760
have all benefited
from her superb medical skills.

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,480
What's more,

50
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,720
she also helped Elder Zhong

51
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,360
develop a special medicine
for treating tetanus,

52
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,730
which

53
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,800
has saved countless soldiers
on the battlefield.

54
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,680
Therefore,

55
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,800
I wish to appoint her
as an imperial physician.

56
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,560
Ministers,

57
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,640
what do you think?

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,120
Your Majesty, please don't!

59
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,340
Having a female official

60
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,480
violates our rites!

61
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,960
There's no precedent

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,520
for a female official
throughout history.

63
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,860
If the precedent is set,

64
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,200
the entire world will laugh at us!

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,360
Please think twice!

66
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,340
Yes.

67
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,480
Please think twice!

68
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,400
Your Majesty, I also disagree.

69
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,000
Our sacred principles of order
are the pillars of the nation.

70
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,840
Women must abide by the virtues.

71
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,120
How can they be officials?

72
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,560
Rong Zelan is skilled in medicine,

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,730
but she can't break the ancestral rules.

74
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,680
I agree.

75
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,440
Be careful with the fire.

76
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,360
- Be careful.
- Aye.

77
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,960
Select carefully.

78
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,560
- Okay.
- Don't miss anything.

79
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,400
Be careful.

80
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,720
Sort the herbs carefully.

81
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,800
Something's wrong!

82
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,640
Something's wrong!

83
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,120
Have you heard?

84
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,200
The ministers are arguing
over Rong Zelan's appointment

85
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,440
as imperial physician!

86
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,640
Is that true?

87
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,000
Only men can be physicians.

88
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,240
How can we allow a woman
to stand as our equal?

89
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,320
- That's right.
- No way.

90
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,550
Exactly.

91
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,320
Men have always held the power
in the bureau.

92
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,040
If she becomes a physician,

93
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,280
it'd be a disaster!

94
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,600
Yes!

95
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,320
Disaster!

96
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,000
We must make our stance clear!

97
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,530
We won't share the court with women!

98
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,120
This is so unacceptable!

99
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,290
We must oppose it

100
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,950
and safeguard the ancestral rites!

101
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,200
Let's go to the court and ask

102
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,600
His Majesty to retract the decree!

103
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,000
No female officials!

104
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,040
Let's go!

105
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,280
No female officials!

106
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,160
Let's go to the court!

107
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,370
Retract the decree!

108
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,160
No female officials!

109
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,600
Please retract the decree!

110
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,920
Your Majesty, there's no precedent

111
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,720
for a female official
throughout history.

112
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,480
Such a precedent cannot be set!

113
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,520
Exactly.

114
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,840
A woman needs no talent.

115
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,760
How can they participate in
state affairs?

116
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,200
Your Majesty.

117
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,490
Rong Zelan has made
remarkable contributions.

118
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,270
Please think it through!

119
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,560
My Lords, I've heard

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,080
you're arguing over
my appointment as an imperial physician.

121
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,680
I wonder if I could

122
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,600
enter the hall and speak for myself.

123
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,760
Summon her.

124
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,320
Rong Zelan,
first-class attendant of the bureau,

125
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,560
bows to Your Majesty.

126
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,260
Your Majesty.

127
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,120
All the imperial physicians
are outside on their knees,

128
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,520
begging you to retract the decree,

129
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
saying, "No female officials."

130
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,640
No female officials!

131
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Retract the decree!

132
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,800
Retract the decree!

133
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,520
Rong Zelan,

134
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,520
this is a rare opportunity.

135
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,160
Feel free to tell

136
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,240
the ministers what you're thinking.

137
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,000
Thanks, Your Majesty.

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,880
I just heard you mention that

139
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,960
virtue for a woman
lies in her lack of talent,

140
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,960
and we shouldn't
participate in state affairs.

141
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,880
The original meaning of the saying

142
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,920
is that a woman should possess knowledge

143
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,040
and judgment

144
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,640
without showing them.

145
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,880
This is a rare virtue.

146
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,080
However, since when

147
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,920
did it become
a shackle that binds women?

148
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,000
Huang Daopo led the people
to innovate

149
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,320
cotton spinning techniques,

150
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,360
promoting the development
of cotton weaving,

151
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,960
which has benefited all.

152
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,680
Has anyone ever said a woman like her

153
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,840
shouldn't take part in worldly affairs?

154
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,840
There's no precedent
for a female official.

155
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
If the precedent is set,

156
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,640
it'll be a disaster!

157
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,720
Li Bing innovatively built

158
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,820
Dujiangyan Irrigation System.

159
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,240
Cai Lun's papermaking technique
had no existing model.

160
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,320
If we never broke any rules,

161
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,600
Great Liang would still be
recording events by tying knots.

162
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,600
Moreover, a physician's duty
is to heal and save lives,

163
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,160
and their skills shouldn't be
judged by gender.

164
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,680
Benevolence

165
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,800
knows no gender.

166
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
Attendant Rong

167
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,200
saved Her Majesty with acupuncture

168
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,720
and protected the imperial heir.

169
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,800
With such achievements,

170
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,560
I can't believe you're still arguing

171
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,960
over rites and rules.

172
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,680
You're truly

173
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,160
utterly benighted!

174
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,880
Nonsense!

175
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,240
All you can do is flattering!

176
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,530
Your Majesty,

177
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,680
Rong Zelan is the daughter
of the sinner Liu Fuling.

178
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,600
Sinners' children
cannot become officials.

179
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,240
It's written in the law!

180
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,360
My Lord,

181
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,600
does the Imperial City Office
have any case files

182
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,200
regarding my mother's crimes?

183
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
If no case files,

184
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,040
how can you convict her

185
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,440
and accuse me of being
the daughter of a sinner?

186
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,520
Does the Imperial City Department
have such case files?

187
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,240
Your Majesty,

188
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
there are no files
for Liu Fuling's case.

189
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,760
Your Majesty,

190
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,320
there are no case files,

191
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,240
nor have they ever handled the case.

192
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,000
Therefore, my mother is not a sinner.

193
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,360
Back then, my mother

194
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,840
used a topical method to treat

195
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,920
Her Majesty's asthma,

196
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,510
taking advantage of yang energy,

197
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,730
and using acrid-warm medicine
to dispel the hidden phlegm.

198
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,720
However, due to Her Majesty's old age,

199
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,640
her energy was unstable,

200
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,280
so it required time to take effect.

201
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,080
You're well-paid high officials,

202
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,480
yet you know nothing

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,240
about the adaptability of medicine.

204
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,800
Instead, you hide behind regulations
to fabricate charges.

205
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,400
In the end,

206
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,390
you are simply afraid

207
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,440
that the woman
who once bowed to your will

208
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
would stand as your equal

209
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,420
as a female official.

210
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,000
Your constant talk of moral principles

211
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,920
is nothing but a fig leaf
to protect your power.

212
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,920
If one truly wants to
benefit the people,

213
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,920
how could they use gender as an excuse

214
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,880
to turn a blind eye to
the suffering of women and children?

215
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,800
If one truly wants to secure the realm,

216
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,600
they should allow women to be physicians

217
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,920
so that all women can have
access to medical care

218
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,120
and receive timely treatment.

219
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,280
Your Majesty,

220
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,880
I'm willing to dedicate my life

221
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
to battling against
all illnesses in the world.

222
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,520
Your Majesty, please discard the old

223
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,840
to bring forth the new

224
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,200
and appoint me as

225
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,360
an imperial physician!

226
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,960
Your Majesty, I agree.

227
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,680
Report!

228
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,480
Your Majesty!

229
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,560
Your Majesty, something's wrong!

230
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,560
Two princess fell from their horses.

231
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,440
The Second Prince
is in critical condition!

232
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,680
What?
