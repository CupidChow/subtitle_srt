00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=Princess Consort Gives Birth in Coffin=

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,040
Hurry!

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,840
What should we do now?

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,160
Rong Zelan,

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,160
how dare you come?

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,360
Your Eight-Treasure Decoction caused
the premature labor of Her Highness.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,170
You deliberately harmed
the imperial heir!

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,180
This is a capital crime!

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,040
Minister Feng,

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,480
you have no evidence.

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,720
When did I harm Her Highness?

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,320
Your Majesty!

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,880
Your Majesty!

16
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,320
Her Highness

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,500
is bleeding uncontrollably

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,680
and remains unconscious!

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,400
The child cannot be delivered!

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,880
If this continues,

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,200
I'm afraid they'll both die!

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,420
Your Majesty!

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,120
Please allow me to check on Her Highness!

24
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,720
I know her conditions the best!

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,040
Feng Mingyuan,

26
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
go inside and save her.

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,600
You must ensure their safety.

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

29
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,960
(They're in this together.)

30
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,300
Your Majesty,

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,280
please allow me to check on Her Highness!

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,440
Rong Zelan,

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,000
if this has something to do with you,

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,600
I will certainly take your life!

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,880
Your Majesty, I swear on my life...

36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,720
Shut up!

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,800
One more word,

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,080
and I'll punish you too!

39
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,320
Her Highness

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,600
has lost all pulse.

41
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,080
Your Majesty,

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,100
please allow me

43
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,410
to assist Minister Feng.

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,440
Feng Mingyuan's medical skills

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,440
are second only to Wu Chunlin.

46
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,800
You're just a medical officer.

47
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,880
Could you possibly be better than him?

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,320
Go.

49
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,200
Your Majesty!

50
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,160
I'm useless!

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
By the time I entered the room,

52
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,280
Her Highness had

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,240
lost all breath and pulse!

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Your Majesty, I deserve to die!

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,360
You lowly attendant!

56
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,280
You knew she was pregnant,

57
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,600
yet you used medicine recklessly.

58
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,040
Who do you think you are?

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
Divine Healer Hua Tuo?

60
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
The matter of heirs

61
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
is of utmost importance.

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,000
How dare you use medicine
without permission?

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,440
You shall be executed!

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,880
Guards,

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,760
drag Rong Zelan away
and beat her to death!

66
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,920
The premature childbirth of Her Highness

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,920
is highly suspicious.

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,080
Please investigate thoroughly
before punishing her!

69
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,960
With solid evidence,
why should I investigate it?

70
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,360
Drag her away!

71
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,200
Your Majesty, wait!

72
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,600
Please allow me to check on

73
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,000
Her Highness once again!

74
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,990
Your Majesty!

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,840
Please think twice!

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,200
Rong Zelan!

77
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,450
She's already gone!

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,200
Do you think you're an immortal

79
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,800
who can bring her back to life?

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,960
What are you waiting for?

81
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,000
Drag her away!

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,160
Your Majesty!

83
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,440
Please think twice!

84
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,270
Please allow me to check on her!

85
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,680
Your Majesty!

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,480
Wait!

87
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,950
Your Highness,

88
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,240
please don't obstruct
the Imperial Guard's duty.

89
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,620
Lord Xiao,

90
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,910
I just want to say a few words.

91
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,140
Please do me a favor.

92
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
Song Lingxiao,

93
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,960
before Feng Mingyuan entered the room,

94
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,400
he looked at Consort Ning,

95
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,640
which was truly strange.

96
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,240
I have a feeling
that Her Highness's death

97
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,360
is very suspicious.

98
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,640
You must find a way to get inside

99
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,600
to check if her eyes

100
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,840
are dull and lifeless,

101
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,040
her hands and feet cold and stiff,

102
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,360
and her facial muscles loose and weak?

103
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,720
Okay.

104
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,800
I got it.

105
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,480
Hang in there.

106
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,760
Wait for me.

107
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,160
Lord Xiao, I know

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,560
His Majesty trusts you the most.

109
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,520
You never show mercy
when carrying out orders.

110
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,040
But she's

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,080
the person I care about the most

112
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,400
in my life.

113
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,640
Lord Xiao, I beg you

114
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,080
to slow down

115
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
the execution.

116
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,040
I'll be right back.

117
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,360
Please!

118
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,160
You have one hour.

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
I guarantee she won't die

120
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,960
in an hour.

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,440
Thank you!

122
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,440
Your Majesty.

123
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,760
I'm useless.

124
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
I deserve to die.

125
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,360
But she's already gone.

126
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,120
Please take care of your body.

127
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,600
My condolences.

128
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,720
Prepare the coffin.

129
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
Bury Princess Consort

130
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,880
with full honors.

131
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,480
Aye.

132
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,280
Stop!

133
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,280
Song Lingxiao, how dare you?

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,000
Princess Consort is gone.

135
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,610
How dare you disrespect her?

136
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,920
Song Lingxiao,

137
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,960
what are you doing?

138
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,880
Guards, drag him away!

139
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,520
(Am I really going to)

140
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,190
(die here?)

141
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,720
(I haven't proven my mother's innocence.)

142
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,480
(How can I die like this?)

143
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,800
(Zelan,)

144
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,880
(wait for me.)

145
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,200
(I'm coming.)

146
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,920
By the emperor's decree,

147
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,920
stop!

148
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,520
Lord Xiao,

149
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,680
His Majesty asked me...

150
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,120
Lord Xiao,

151
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,280
sorry for the offense.

152
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,040
If I can survive today,

153
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,280
I'll certainly make amends.

154
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,360
This is urgent.

155
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,400
I have to take her away!

156
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,760
How is

157
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,080
Her Highness?

158
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,320
As you said,

159
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,200
Her Highness's gaze is still focused,

160
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,240
and her body is supple.

161
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,600
Step back.

162
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,760
Let them go.

163
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,000
Wait!

164
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,760
Step back.

165
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,320
Back!

166
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,200
No one moves!

167
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,280
Song Lingxiao, what are you doing?

168
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,500
Do you want to defy me and the law?

169
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Your Majesty,

170
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,280
I can't abide by the law today.

171
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,640
I only know

172
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
even if no one believes Attendant Rong,

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,920
I will.

174
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,800
No matter what she does,

175
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,040
I will protect her!

176
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,570
Your Majesty,

177
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,440
Attendant Rong asked me

178
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,840
to check on Her Highness.

179
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Although she has no breath,

180
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,240
her eyes,

181
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,000
joints, and flesh still show
signs of life.

182
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
It may be suspended animation.

183
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,040
Perhaps she can still be saved.

184
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,880
Don't you want to save
your daughter-in-law

185
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,120
and grandchild?

186
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,480
Nonsense!

187
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,400
Your Majesty, Her Highness has no pulse.

188
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,240
She's already dead.

189
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,000
They're simply talking nonsense!

190
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,490
You can't trust them!

191
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,840
No fetal movement.

192
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,720
Extremely weak pulse.

193
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,520
There's still hope.

194
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,880
Quick!

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,200
Get me an embroidery needle!

196
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,520
Hurry!

197
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,600
Your Majesty,

198
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,560
hurry,

199
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,720
make a decision.

200
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,760
Your Majesty, please don't!

201
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,600
Get a needle!

202
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,860
- Get the needle!
- Aye!

203
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,680
The fetus is stuck in the middle,

204
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,080
pressing her body

205
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,600
and causing a counterflow of blood.

206
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,960
Your Highness!

207
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,080
Your Highness!

208
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
Push! Come on!

209
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,640
Breathe!

210
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,440
Push, push!

211
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,400
Push!

212
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Push!

213
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,760
Breathe! Push!

214
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,160
- Push!
- Push!

215
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,280
Push!

216
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,200
She did it!

217
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,600
She did it!

218
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,280
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,960
They are both safe.

220
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,960
It's an heir!

221
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,760
Wonderful!

222
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,920
Wonderful!

223
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,640
I have a grandson!

224
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,880
- I have a grandson!
- Yes!
