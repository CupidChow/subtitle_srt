00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,340
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=I've Seen Through Your Stupid Trick!=

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,720
Thank you for telling me this.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,320
I shall take my leave.

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,800
Have you found any clues
from Her Highness?

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,040
I've already checked every step

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,240
but found nothing wrong.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,880
What am I missing?

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,080
It's getting hotter and hotter.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,560
I heard that Lord Wu even
proposed to His Majesty

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,920
that all water used in the palace
must be boiled first.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,480
We can't drink cold water
drawn from the well.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,720
Why?

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,920
Why do we have to
drink hot water on hot days?

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,240
Wouldn't that make it even hotter?

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,120
Lord Wu said

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,000
it could prevent insect eggs.

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,510
But the well water

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,040
looks quite clean.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,880
Your Highness.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,040
I got it!

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,480
It's water!

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,320
Your Majesty,

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,840
based on my careful investigation,

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,600
the cause of the premature delivery

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,440
lies in the water used for decoction.

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,280
Someone secretly replaced it

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,960
with water boiled in a copper pot.

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,880
What's wrong with

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,520
that?

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,360
Water boiled in a copper pot

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,280
will greatly change the nature of herbs,

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,680
making them harmful.

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,120
Moreover, this method cannot
be detected with a silver needle.

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,680
Someone replaced
the water used for decoction

37
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,320
with water boiled in a copper pot,

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,120
and I unknowingly used it.

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,160
In this way,

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,120
it is the same as making a decoction
in a copper pot,

41
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,920
which

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
caused the Princess Consort's
premature delivery.

43
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,480
I can't believe it.

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,800
Do you know

45
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,880
who did it?

46
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,960
Your Majesty,

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,440
I don't know.

48
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,880
Your Majesty,

49
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,040
I've heard

50
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,760
we got a spirit cat
from abroad as tribute.

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
This cat is extremely intelligent

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,800
and can detect
whether a person is telling the truth.

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,520
The person may answer questions

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,320
with their hands on its body.

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,640
If it's the truth,

56
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,560
the cat will remain calm.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,280
If it's a lie,

58
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
the cat will become restless.

59
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,680
I suggest we use this cat.

60
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,600
Perhaps it can help us
find the real culprit.

61
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,000
This is so ridiculous.

62
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,680
Your Majesty,

63
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,680
this method sounds very mysterious,

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,640
but in order to uncover the truth,

65
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,640
I'm also

66
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,000
willing to give it a try.

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,320
Guards,

68
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,880
bring the spirit cat here.

69
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,600
In addition,

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,440
bring all personnel involved
from the bureau

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,560
here and

72
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,760
inspect them one by one.

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,320
Aye.

74
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,660
Your Majesty,

75
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,600
the cat fears light

76
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,520
and will become agitated
when it sees light.

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,120
We need to extinguish the candles.

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,920
Do it.

79
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Aye.

80
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,560
Did you tamper with the water?

81
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,440
No.

82
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
Did you go to the Decoction Office?

83
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,000
No.

84
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Did you change the water?

85
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,320
No.

86
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,560
Did you change the water?

87
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,160
No.

88
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
Did you go to the Decoction Office?

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,680
No.

90
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Did you change the water?

91
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,400
No.

92
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,760
Did you go to the Decoction Office?

93
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,360
Did you tamper with the water?

94
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,000
No, I didn't.

95
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
Lord Feng,

96
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,280
did you tamper with the decoction

97
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,920
for Her Highness?

98
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,560
Did you ever change the water?

99
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,120
Officer Song, you're so funny.

100
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,440
How could I possibly harm Her Highness?

101
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,760
I

102
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,880
didn't change the water.

103
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,760
You've inspected everyone.

104
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,160
However,

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,320
the cat hasn't made a sound.

106
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,880
Your Majesty,

107
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,600
we may light the candles.

108
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,360
Light the candles.

109
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,800
Everyone,

110
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,520
please extend your right hand.

111
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,040
Attendant Wu,

112
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,000
why is your hand so clean?

113
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,760
Were you too guilty

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,120
to place your hand on the spirit cat?

115
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,520
Answer me!

116
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,280
Everyone,

117
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,560
the cat is fake.

118
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,280
We just played a lie detection game.

119
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,080
Lord Song and I

120
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,200
had applied charcoal powder

121
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,160
onto the black fur ball.

122
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,360
An innocent person

123
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,000
would naturally dare
to place their hands on it.

124
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,240
But if the person is guilty,

125
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,240
they definitely wouldn't dare.

126
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,160
Well, Lord Feng,

127
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,560
why didn't you reach out your hand?

128
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,520
Lord Feng,

129
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,520
are you afraid?

130
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,160
Or could it be

131
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,240
that your hand

132
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,520
is also clean?

133
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,240
I just find

134
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,000
such a trick too ridiculous,

135
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,160
and I don't

136
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,280
want to be a part of it.

137
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,600
You're still denying it.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,840
Feng Mingyuan,

139
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,480
show me your hand!

140
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

141
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,320
(I've seen through)

142
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,600
(your stupid trick.)

143
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,160
Attendant Wu,

144
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,360
with solid evidence,
are you still going to deny it?

145
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,040
Did you change the water
used for the decoction?

146
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,600
Spare me, Your Majesty!

147
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,360
I did

148
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,000
change the water.

149
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,920
I...

150
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,600
I had no choice!

151
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,480
Who ordered you to do this?

152
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,120
Guards,

153
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,360
drag her away

154
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,840
and interrogate her thoroughly.

155
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,840
Your Majesty, have mercy!

156
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,120
I'll say it!

157
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,980
I'll say it!

158
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,040
It was...

159
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,360
It was Minister Feng who ordered me

160
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,040
to replace it

161
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,680
with water boiled in a copper pot.

162
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,120
Not just that,

163
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
the plague as well!

164
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,080
It was also Lord Feng

165
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,440
who lured Rong Zelan to Su Ye's side

166
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,200
to make her fall ill

167
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,540
so that he could get rid of her!

168
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,570
I've said everything I know!

169
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,720
Your Majesty!

170
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,080
Please spare my life!

171
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,120
Your Majesty!

172
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,240
He forced me into this!

173
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,040
Attendant Wu,

174
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,000
I heard you stole medicine

175
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
because of your sick brother.

176
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,920
Tell me,

177
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,200
did you really steal it
for your brother?

178
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,400
Minister Feng,

179
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,320
I... I'm so sorry.

180
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,600
I'll never steal medicine
from the pharmacy again.

181
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,040
Don't be afraid.

182
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
You only need to be a good girl

183
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,960
and do whatever

184
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,440
I tell you to do.

185
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,120
If you can complete the mission,

186
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,360
I won't

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,880
send you to the Office of Punishment.

188
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
What do you think?

189
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,880
I got it.

190
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,800
I will follow your orders.

191
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,360
Okay.

192
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,400
Your Majesty, I'm innocent!

193
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,440
Attendant Wu is talking nonsense

194
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
and slandering me!

195
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
I...

196
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm innocent!

197
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,040
Lord Feng,

198
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,680
we've got the evidence and witness.

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,920
How dare you deny it?

200
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,320
Why is your mouth

201
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,880
as stiff as a dead duck's beak?

202
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,400
Your Majesty!

203
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,480
It's getting hotter.

204
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,840
I asked Attendant Wu
to boil the well water

205
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,520
only to kill insect eggs.

206
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,120
Every year in this season,

207
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,080
we always boil well water
before drinking.

208
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,680
Besides, even if I had her

209
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,960
boil the well water,

210
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,680
how could it

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,880
be poisonous?

212
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,200
We all drink

213
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,640
boiled water,

214
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,080
but no one has been poisoned!

215
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,280
Minister Feng,

216
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,560
we've been emphasizing

217
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,600
that the decoction used
water boiled in a copper pot.

218
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,400
I will now prove to you

219
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,480
whether such a decoction

220
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,600
is poisonous or not.

221
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,120
Look at you!

222
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,360
After I discovered the problem,

223
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,080
I secretly asked Officer Song to

224
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,520
replace the water you used

225
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,280
for making tea and tonic soup

226
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,320
with water boiled in a copper pot.

227
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,840
Look at you,

228
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,080
your hair is falling out.

229
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,320
How dare you say it's not poisonous?
