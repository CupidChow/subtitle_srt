=Rise of Her Lady Physician=

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,340
=Episode 27=

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=Zelan Clears Her Mother's Name=

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,560
Wretch!

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,400
You're truly a heartless, venomous demon!

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,000
You harmed my offspring

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,080
and ruined my harem!

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,520
I'm a demon?

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,040
You're the reason

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,840
why I've ended up like this.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,960
It's all your fault.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,960
How dare you?

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,360
What did I do wrong?

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,120
You've been delaying the appointment
of the Crown Prince.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,560
You once told me...

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,520
You said my son was the one

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,960
you valued the most!

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,040
You said you'd make him
the Crown Prince!

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,360
And then?

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,400
You said the same to the others.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,760
You treat all of us as pawns,

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,160
moving us around at will
on the board of power!

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,600
Dad...

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,360
Dad!

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,520
Why would you do this to me?

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,000
I had someone I loved!

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,200
We were deeply in love!

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,360
However, for the sake of the family,

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,440
you forcibly sent me into

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,320
the cruel Imperial Palace!

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,760
You also told me to give birth to a son

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,120
so that I could make him
the Crown Prince

33
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,280
and bring honor to the whole family!

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
Therefore,

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,440
I had no choice but to eliminate anyone
in my way.

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,760
(Behind the vermilion walls)

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,520
(are stairs built with bones.)

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,240
(Beneath the gilded honor)

39
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,520
(lies countless tears and blood.)

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,560
(Those rules praised as feminine virtue)

41
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,400
(have become blades
pressed to our throat.)

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,000
(Some use them to climb,)

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,440
(while others are driven to madness.)

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,680
(In the end,)

45
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,640
(We're all pitiable souls trapped in
the same invisible cage.)

46
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,560
Silence!

47
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,640
Silence!

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,080
How dare you distort the truth

49
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,920
and talk nonsense!

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,120
Starting today,

51
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,240
Consort Ning is stripped of her title!

52
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
Grant her poisoned wine!

53
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
Wait.

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,320
The Second Prince didn't die.

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,920
What did you say?

56
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
He survived.

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,640
My son is alive,

58
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,240
right?

59
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,720
My son is still alive, right?

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,800
Drag her out!

61
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,320
My son is still alive!

62
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
My son is still alive!

63
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,240
Is that true?

64
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,240
My son is still alive!

65
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,800
Rong Zelan.

66
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,000
Well done again.

67
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,280
You didn't let me down.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

69
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,080
This is my duty as a healer.

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,360
Lingxiao.

71
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
Now that the matter is over,

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,320
it's time for you to leave the bureau.

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,320
Oh, no.

75
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,600
We mocked His Highness like that.

76
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,000
He definitely won't let us off.

77
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,400
That's right.

78
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,600
Who would've thought he's actually

79
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,000
the famous Marquis Xuanping's heir?

80
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,120
What should we do now?

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,440
Take a look at this.

82
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,880
Your Highness!

83
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,600
Your Highness!

84
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,880
Previously, I was too ignorant.

85
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,000
I shouldn't have mocked you
for using connections.

86
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,150
I deserve punishment!

87
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,240
Your Highness, please forgive me!

88
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
We were so stupid.

89
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,360
We shouldn't have said
you were hopeless.

90
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,120
Please forgive me!

91
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,060
He had it coming.

92
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,200
He wouldn't listen to us.

93
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,600
You want me to forgive you.

94
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,040
Well, I can forgive you.

95
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,440
How about this?

96
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,040
For the whole day today,

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,680
whenever you see someone, you must say,

98
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,680
"I am completely

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,840
hopeless."

100
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,880
If you can do this,
I'll consider forgiving you.

101
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,800
Yes, Your Highness!

102
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Thanks, Your Highness!

103
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm completely

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,520
hopeless!

105
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,080
I'm completely hopeless!

106
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,120
Well...

107
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,160
Why are you looking at me like this?

108
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,720
Is something wrong?

109
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,240
Or maybe...

110
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,120
Are you enchanted by me?

111
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,840
You brought me here.

112
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
Anything to say?

113
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,640
I've completed my mission

114
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,160
at the Imperial Medical Bureau.

115
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,560
From now on,

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,920
I can no longer stay

117
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,160
in the palace every day.

118
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,720
Be safe.

119
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,200
Be safe?

120
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,480
Is that all you want to say?

121
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,280
Yes.

122
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,200
It's getting late.

123
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,440
The gates will be locked soon.

124
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,440
Are you leaving today?

125
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,440
You…

126
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,280
Do you really want me to leave?

127
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,400
Hey!

128
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,000
Lord Song.

129
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,800
I will.

130
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,520
Do you know what I'm going to say?

131
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,360
You will what?

132
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,000
No matter what you say,

133
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,320
I will agree.

134
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,720
I wonder if you have someone you like.

135
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,600
If not,

136
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,680
let's get engaged.

137
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,360
Okay.

138
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,720
But...

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,680
This is a big deal.

140
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,960
Shouldn't you

141
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,680
inform your family first?

142
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,200
My mother passed away.

143
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,720
I can decide

144
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,200
who I will marry.

145
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,720
Okay.

146
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,800
Then we'll do it.

147
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,360
Today,

148
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
I'd like to share

149
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,400
a piece of good news with you.

150
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
Your Majesty, please be clear.

151
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,800
Rong Zelan,

152
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
with extraordinary skills,

153
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,520
has turned the tide many times

154
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,600
and saved many.

155
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,000
She's not only
carried forward ulcer treatment

156
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,200
among the army

157
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
but also developed special prescriptions,

158
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,320
benefiting all the people.

159
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,800
She's professional and compassionate,

160
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,920
truly a role model
for physicians across the realm.

161
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,360
I've decided to appoint Rong Zelan

162
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,280
as the first female imperial physician

163
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,800
in Great Liang!

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,840
I

165
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,960
accept the decree!

166
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,560
Thanks, Your Majesty!

167
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,760
In addition,

168
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,280
the case of my mother's birthday banquet
from ten years ago

169
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,480
has been solved.

170
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,000
Liu Fuling's diagnosis and treatment
of my mother

171
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,280
were timely and appropriate

172
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,520
without any mistakes.

173
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,160
I've issued a decree

174
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,440
to restore her reputation

175
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,400
and set the record straight.

176
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
Your Majesty,

177
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,880
I'm grateful for this!

178
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,960
Song Lingxiao.

179
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,000
You're looking at her so fondly.

180
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,080
Are you really that impatient?

181
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,960
I've

182
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,840
long heard of the romance between

183
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,800
you and Physician Rong.

184
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,120
Today,

185
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,720
I'll do you a favor.

186
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,720
I'll bestow the marriage

187
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,640
for you two.

188
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,400
Wonderful.

189
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,450
Great.

190
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,320
Great.

191
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,040
Thanks, Your Majesty!

192
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,880
(Imperial Decree)
By His Majesty's decree,

193
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,720
Rong Zelan, Imperial Physician
