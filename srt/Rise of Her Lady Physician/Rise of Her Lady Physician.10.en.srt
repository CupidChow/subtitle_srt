4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,760
Attendant Feng!

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,800
How did it go?

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,680
I've taken care of it.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,080
I tampered with the candles

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,120
at the Ji'an Office.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,800
Rong Zelan will fall unconscious
in less than

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,040
half an hour.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,240
And the coffin...

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,840
I've nailed the coffin shut as well.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,480
I-I don't think she can survive.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,200
Well done.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,240
Attendant Feng,

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
what you promised me...

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,800
Rest assured.

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,480
I've told my uncle

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,150
to find an opportunity
to transfer you back.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,000
Just be patient.

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,210
Great!

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,080
Great.

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,680
The Ji'an Office...

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,480
It's not a place for people to stay.

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,600
I deal with corpses every day.

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,960
I just can't stand it anymore!

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,200
Once I'm promoted,

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,440
I'll transfer you back right away.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,120
Well,

30
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,960
how long will that take?

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,480
Two months at most.

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,800
Okay.

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,200
Okay.

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,120
Attendant Feng,

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,360
please don't forget

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,560
to transfer me back!

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,000
I know.

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,040
Just go back.

39
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,360
Okay.

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,440
(Rong Zelan,)

41
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,480
(you won't be able to
get in my way anymore.)

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,040
It's the middle of the night.

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,840
How could there be sounds in the morgue?

44
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,000
If you can sleep
in that coffin for one night,

45
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,360
I'll agree to teach you.

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
Okay, no problem.

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,640
Oh, no.

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,080
She didn't actually sleep
in that coffin, did she?

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,800
Zelan, is that you?

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,600
It's me.

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,360
It's me, Elder Zhong.

52
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,360
Hang in there!

53
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,080
I'll get you out right away!

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,840
Zelan!

55
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,200
Are you okay?

56
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
Elder Zhong.

57
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,840
Did I pass the test?

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,960
Can you teach me medical skills now?

59
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,290
Little brat,

60
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,560
you nearly died,

61
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,580
and you're still
thinking about medical skills.

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Zelan!

63
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,520
(It wasn't Elder Zhong.)

64
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,840
(So, who tried to harm me?)

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
If you want to be a specimen,

66
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,520
provoke me as you want.

67
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,640
(Feng Yin,)

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,000
(I became a second-class attendant
before you do,)

69
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,280
(so you got me sent to the Ji'an Office.)

70
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,760
(And now you even want to kill me.)

71
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,440
(In that case, I won't
show mercy for you anymore.)

72
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Senior.

73
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
You're finally awake.

74
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,920
Who'd be so bold

75
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,440
to attempt to murder you under my watch?

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,440
Senior.

77
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,320
Look, I'm not afraid of pain

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,280
or death.

79
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,960
I even made it through
the desperate situation last night.

80
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,880
Am I qualified

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,200
to learn ulcer treatment?

82
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,080
Do you think you can learn

83
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,160
my secret skills
with just one desperate effort?

84
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,720
What else do you want me to do?

85
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,560
- I can...
- Take the medicine.

86
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,960
Get healthy again.

87
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,160
If you want to be my disciple,

88
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,360
you must show me your

89
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,640
perseverance and determination

90
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,720
instead of a momentary impulse.

91
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,160
Master, you must keep your word.

92
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,080
Who is your master?

93
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,600
If you say that again,

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
I'll add Coptis to your medicine!

95
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,760
Lie down.

96
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,520
Thank you, Master!

97
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,860
(Ji'an Office)

98
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,220
(Ji'an Office)

99
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,760
What are you doing here?

100
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,840
Sorry to trouble you.

101
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,040
I'm Song Lingxiao,

102
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,120
a medical officer.

103
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm here to visit Rong Zelan...

104
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,930
and you.

105
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
I wonder if you...

106
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,240
I heard that girl
was demoted to the Ji'an Office

107
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,120
because of a person surnamed Song.

108
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,680
It was you, right?

109
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,080
Sir, this is a misunderstanding.

110
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,920
We've known each other for a long time.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,160
I did suggest His Majesty

112
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,600
to demote her to the Ji'an Office,

113
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,240
but it's a long story.

114
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,360
Sir, could you please do me a favor?

115
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,470
I'm not a bad person.

116
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,240
She's doing well here!

117
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,040
Ji'an Office

118
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,770
is where the living avoid

119
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,520
and the dead rest.

120
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,160
Hurry up and leave!

121
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,880
Look!

122
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Then please

123
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,760
give this to her for me.

124
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,760
Get lost!

125
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,680
Sorry for the trouble.

126
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,960
(Rong Zelan,)

127
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,600
(hope you're doing well)

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,840
(at the Ji'an Office)

129
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,360
(and can come back soon.)

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,190
- Rong Zelan!
- Leave!

131
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,200
Leave!

132
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,400
The five viscera
connect through the heart,

133
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
and the heart fuels
the five visceral systems.

134
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,200
(Rong Zelan?)

135
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,320
(She's still alive.)

136
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,460
What's going on?

137
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,760
Didn't you say you took care of it?

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,040
Why is she still alive?

139
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,480
That night,

140
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,400
I did exactly as you said.

141
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,270
But who'd have known
Elder Zhong would suddenly come

142
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,200
and save her?

143
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,120
Find a way to get rid of Rong Zelan,

144
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,520
or I'll tell my uncle
to revoke the transfer order,

145
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,760
and you'll spend
the rest of your life here.

146
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,000
No!

147
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,240
Attendant Feng,

148
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,880
give me another chance.

149
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,620
Don't worry,

150
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,840
I will definitely succeed this time.

151
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,040
You'd better keep your word.

152
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,080
She can't always be that lucky.

153
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,640
She escaped once,

154
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,200
but it won't happen again.

155
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,660
(Tetanus)

156
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,440
Master,

157
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,840
are you working on medicine for tetanus?

158
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,880
At present,

159
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,880
the medicine effective for
wound infections caused by tetanus

160
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
is far too expensive.

161
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,720
One dose of medicine

162
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,780
is worth an ordinary household's

163
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,600
three years of food rations.

164
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,280
On the battlefield, many soldiers

165
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,580
get infected

166
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
with no medicine available

167
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,400
and have no choice

168
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,600
but to die in desperation.

169
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,640
So, when I was young,

170
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
I swore

171
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,160
to develop

172
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,520
inexpensive and effective medicine

173
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
specifically for treating tetanus.

174
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,320
Why did you come here and ask this

175
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,120
instead of lying in bed?

176
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,080
Master.

177
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,560
I want to help you with the research,

178
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,040
and the wound on my body

179
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,520
can test the medicine.

180
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,640
Nonsense!

181
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,800
This prescription is still
in the testing stage.

182
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,640
The ratio of herbs hasn't been adjusted,

183
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
and its nature is unclear.

184
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,360
If you rashly use it on yourself,

185
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,600
at best, the injury will worsen,

186
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,440
and at worst, it could
endanger your life.

187
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,560
Master,

188
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
that is exactly why

189
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,040
we need someone to test the medicine.

190
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,440
There are death row prisoners.

191
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,560
It's not your turn, stupid girl.

192
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,400
If you test it on death row prisoners,

193
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,840
it might take years
without making any progress.

194
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
Master,

195
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,360
the sooner it's proven effective,

196
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,160
the sooner it can save lives.

197
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,880
As your disciple,

198
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,800
I'm the most suitable tester.

199
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,600
Your pulse is extremely weak

200
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,680
with severe depletion
of energy and blood.

201
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,080
Trying strong medicine now

202
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,080
is just like drinking poison.

203
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,160
It is precisely because
I'm gravely injured

204
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,920
that I should test the medicine now.

205
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,960
Master, please let me try.

206
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,120
Just like you, I don't want to see
people and soldiers

207
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,320
die due to the lack of medication.

208
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,280
If my sacrifice could yield a cure,

209
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,000
I would die

210
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,480
with no regrets.

211
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,080
Stop talking nonsense!

212
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,000
Now that you're my disciple,

213
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,640
I must ensure your safety.

214
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,320
Go back and rest.

215
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,000
Do not bring this up again.

216
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,720
Put it down.

217
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,280
(At a quarter to eight,)

218
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,360
(the burning sensation
spreads to my forearm.)

219
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,880
(The long-festering wound)

220
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,920
(actually formed a scab.)

221
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,160
(Could it be that the wound)

222
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,600
(came into contact
with the green mold on the orange?)

223
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,880
(At a quarter to seven,)

224
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,080
(the wound has a light, thin scab.)

225
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,400
(Tetanus Test)
Are you crazy?

226
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,120
Even death row prisoners
wouldn't dare to use it!

227
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,480
Do you have a death wish?

228
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,640
Attendant Zhou!

229
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,680
Come here!

230
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,160
Coming!

231
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,240
Elder Zhong, what is so urgent?

232
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,560
Rush to the Imperial Pharmacy

233
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
and tell them I need Purple-Snow Dew.

234
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,440
Go and come back quickly,

235
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,960
or I won't let you off!

236
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,320
What are you waiting for?

237
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,280
Okay!

238
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,120
Girl, you're awake!

239
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,320
Master,

240
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,240
I've figured out

241
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,000
how to treat tetanus...

242
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,960
Girl!

243
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,640
Wake up!
