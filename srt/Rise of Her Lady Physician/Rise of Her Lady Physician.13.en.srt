=Rong Zelan Is to Be Burned for Plague=

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,200
This is...

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,560
smallpox!

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,720
Zelan, I'm begging you!

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,960
Please don't report it!

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,960
I'm just a third-class
medical attendant.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,920
If they find out about this,

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,560
they will burn me to death!

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,760
Su Ye, get up first.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,040
Don't be afraid.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,840
I've had close contact with you

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,320
and might get infected.

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,440
Don't worry, I won't report it.

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,480
Thank you, Zelan.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,280
Su Ye, think carefully.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,440
Recently, have you come into contact
with any unusual objects

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,760
or been to any obscure places?

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,880
Before Yin left the palace,

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,400
she gave me this porcelain bottle,

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,480
saying it was precious.

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,070
She also told me

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,040
to open it
in the Imperial Medical Bureau.

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,200
However, when I opened it,

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
there was nothing

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,120
but some stinky stuff.

28
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,920
I don't know what it is.

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,720
(Did the smallpox)

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
(come from Feng Yin?)

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,160
(Did she deliberately release it)

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,680
(to take revenge on everyone?)

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,640
(Su Ye's situation is complicated.)

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,520
(If I report it,)

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,600
(they will burn her.)

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,440
(If I don't,)

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,840
(the plague might spread,)

38
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,800
(and more people could be infected.)

39
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,760
(What should I do?)

40
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,640
It's late.

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,920
Attendant Rong,

42
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,640
why do you look so troubled?

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,680
Are you missing someone you like?

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,440
Lord Song, are you
wandering around at night

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,190
because you suffer from sleepwalking?

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,160
That is certainly not true.

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
Then why did you say
something so ridiculous?

48
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,380
I...

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,440
Lord Song,

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,840
I just caught a cold.

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
It's better to keep our distance.

52
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,440
We've known each other for a long time,

53
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
and I've been working hard

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,920
to help you find the true culprit.

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,280
I'm not taking credit.

56
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,360
At least I should get some compliments.

57
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,720
However,

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,360
you're still treating me
so indifferently.

59
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm really upset.

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
Attendant Rong,

61
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,200
you don't have to

62
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,480
be so distant with me.

63
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,760
If your pity act were
a bit more sincere,

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,360
I would've believed you.

65
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,600
You haven't told me

66
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,000
what you were thinking.

67
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,280
Lord Song.

68
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,400
Assume that someone
is infected with a plague.

69
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,680
Concealing it would cause
the disease to spread,

70
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,280
whereas reporting it

71
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,920
will lead to the person's death.

72
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Should we save one's life

73
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,600
or protect the others?

74
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,720
It's a dilemma.

75
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,840
For the safety of the nation,

76
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,450
we have no choice but

77
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,360
to choose the majority.

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,600
But every life is precious.

79
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
The best choice is to find a way

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,280
to save them all.

81
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,160
Why do you have such a question?

82
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,280
Lord Song, you're right.

83
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,840
Saving the majority might be cruel,

84
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,360
but it has to be done.

85
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,080
Thanks, Lord Song.

86
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,480
I've made up my mind.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,840
That's good.

88
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
If you need any help,

89
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
just ask me.

90
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
I'll always

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,240
be here.

92
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,200
Su Ye.

93
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,480
Don't scratch it!

94
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,680
I've told you

95
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
not to scratch it.

96
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,650
Zelan.

97
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,160
Do I have pimples on my face?

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,480
Will I die in an ugly way?

99
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,590
Don't be afraid.

100
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,800
As long as you don't scratch it,

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,480
you will neither get ugly nor die.

102
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,440
Really?

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,840
Rest assured.

104
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,000
Zelan!

105
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,960
Stay away from me.

106
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,120
I don't want you to get infected.

107
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,720
I've taken protective measures,

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,040
and I'll be careful.

109
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,040
I had smallpox when I was a child

110
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,120
and won't have it again.

111
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,880
Don't worry.

112
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,660
Really?

113
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
Have I ever lied to you?

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,600
Right now, the most important thing

115
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,480
is to rest well and recover.

116
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,800
Okay.

117
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,380
(Wu Yunxiang, First-class Attendant)
Lord Feng,

118
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,600
in order to protect Su Ye,
who got smallpox,

119
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,040
Rong Zelan stayed
in the same room with her.

120
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Now they're

121
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,960
both in the most secluded wing room
in the backyard.

122
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
They chose a good place.

123
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,040
She's with Su Ye every day

124
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,040
and must've also got smallpox.

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,560
That's exactly what I want.

126
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
We'll have solid proof of
Rong Zelan's concealment

127
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
of the plague.

128
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,720
And she'll be

129
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,800
burned to death.

130
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,080
My Lord, you are farsighted.

131
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,880
These days,

132
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,720
keep a close eye on that room.

133
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,040
If anything happens,

134
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,160
report immediately.

135
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,440
Rong Zelan.

136
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,080
I'll let you live a few more days.

137
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,240
Zelan,

138
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,240
the pox on my face is almost healed.

139
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,960
Zelan, what's wrong?

140
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,720
I'm fine.

141
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,280
Drink the medicine.

142
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,760
Zelan!

143
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,840
Your neck...

144
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,000
You said you got smallpox once.

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,640
You lied to me!

146
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,880
It's all my fault!

147
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,720
Don't worry.

148
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,880
I cured you,

149
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,960
so I can also cure...

150
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,040
But

151
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,520
you got infected because of me.

152
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,920
It's all my fault!

153
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,360
It's okay, Su Ye.

154
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,440
Trust me.

155
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,300
Lord Feng,

156
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,200
it's about time.

157
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,920
Okay.

158
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,160
Inform the others

159
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,000
that we discovered smallpox patients.

160
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,360
To prevent the spread of the plague,

161
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,080
we shall burn and bury
the patients immediately.

162
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,200
Aye.

163
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,040
The third drum exhausts the spirit.

164
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,840
Rong Zelan.

165
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
What are you doing?

166
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,160
By order of Lord Feng,

167
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,080
we'll take you away to be burned.

168
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,620
- Take them away!
- Aye!

169
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,380
What are you doing?

170
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,250
- Get off me!
- Go!

171
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,720
- Go away!
- Get off me!

172
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,400
I heard

173
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,840
it was Su Ye and Rong Zelan
who got infected.

174
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,880
Wh-What should we do?

175
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,680
We stay in the same room

176
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,740
with them.

177
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,760
Could we also...

178
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,880
It's been days,

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and we've seen no symptoms.

180
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,960
We must be fine.

181
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,560
Don't let others hear this,

182
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,920
or we'll be in trouble.

183
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,400
Guards,

184
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,720
light the fire.

185
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,760
Lord Feng,

186
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,200
shouldn't we investigate this thoroughly?

187
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,840
If they do not have smallpox,

188
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,920
wouldn't that make us murderers?

189
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,400
Lord Wu.

190
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,840
Their symptoms are so obvious.

191
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,960
How could it be wrong?

192
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,080
Rong Zelan concealed the situation,

193
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,120
which is a capital crime.

194
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,680
As the minister
of the Imperial Medical Bureau,

195
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,680
you failed to discover it in time.

196
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,670
If the smallpox plague spreads,

197
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,920
I'm afraid you can't afford

198
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,610
to be accused of negligence.

199
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,880
However,

200
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,720
if you don't believe it,

201
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,840
you can verify it yourself.

202
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,200
What do you think?

203
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,960
The pulse is floating and rapid.

204
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,000
It is indeed smallpox.

205
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,480
Guards,

206
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,520
light the fire!

207
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,280
Wait!

208
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,880
I have something to say.
