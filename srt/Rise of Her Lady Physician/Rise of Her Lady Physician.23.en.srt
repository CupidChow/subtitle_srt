00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=Do You Like Me?=

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,800
After I discovered the problem,

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,430
I secretly asked Officer Song to

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,760
replace the water you used

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,560
for making tea and tonic soup

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,520
with water boiled in a copper pot.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,880
Look at you,

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,160
your hair is falling out.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,520
How dare you say it's not poisonous?

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,630
Nonsense!

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,520
Nonsense!

14
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:33,780
I just...

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,360
I just caught a cold!

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,240
Your Majesty, I just caught a cold,

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,960
and my hair fell out.

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,880
Cold, huh?

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,560
It's okay to only drink water

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,640
boiled in a copper pot.

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
But once mixed with herbs or tea,

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,280
it'll alter their medicinal properties.

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,160
You're a healthy person,

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
yet you've lost hair due to
chronic poisoning

25
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,400
from drinking such tea every day,

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,080
let alone the Princess Consort,
who was pregnant and weak.

27
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,040
That is why the fetus was disturbed.

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,600
Your Majesty, I'm innocent!

29
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm innocent!

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,400
Do you think His Majesty will believe

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,080
a mere medical attendant?

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,760
I-I'm innocent!

33
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,400
This lowly servant did it herself!

34
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,720
It has nothing to do with me!

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,640
I'm innocent, Your Majesty!

36
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,960
Feng Mingyuan,

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,600
what is done by night

38
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,920
appears by day.

39
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,160
No, Your Majesty...

40
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,000
Shut up!

41
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,240
Feng Mingyuan,

42
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,200
why did you attempt to harm my grandson?

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,640
Who ordered you to do this?

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,280
Your Majesty, I'm innocent!

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,120
Guards!

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,280
Drag him down

47
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,720
and torture him!

48
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,320
– Aye!
– Your Majesty!

49
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,600
Your Majesty, I'm innocent!

50
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,760
- Get off me!
- Go!

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,840
Get off me!

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,840
No one can judge me!

53
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,600
He's dead!

54
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,480
Oh my god!

55
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,000
Mingyuan...

56
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,040
Here's my decree.

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
Feng Mingyuan

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,800
harmed the imperial heir

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,240
and deserved his death!

60
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
The Feng family will be executed,

61
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,600
and all persons involved in the case

62
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,040
shall be strictly investigated

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,570
and punished

64
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,440
according to the law!

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,840
Mingyuan...

66
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,640
We've known each other since childhood.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
You loved me so much.

68
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,560
Sorry, I've failed you.

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
It's all Rong Zelan's fault!

70
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,240
Back then, her mother ruined my plan.

71
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,360
And you died because of her.

72
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,160
I must make her pay!

73
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,600
I will crush her into mud

74
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
like I did to her mother!

75
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
Rong Zelan!

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,440
Rong Zelan!

77
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,440
What happened?

78
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,440
Are you okay?

79
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,680
Wake up!

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,080
Summon the physician!

81
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,240
Zelan...

82
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Danger and traps

83
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,440
prevail in the palace.

84
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,320
I worry about you every day.

85
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,480
Every time I see you taking risks alone,

86
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,240
I fear that

87
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
I'd never see you again.

88
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,880
I can't believe

89
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,120
it has happened after all.

90
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,720
Zelan...

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
Zelan,

92
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,560
I'm sorry!

93
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,640
Song Lingxiao?

94
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,240
I'm...

95
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,920
out of breath.

96
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,200
You're okay?

97
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,160
I just drank some plum wine
and fell asleep.

98
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,000
So, it's just

99
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,520
plum wine.

100
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,080
Yes.

101
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,760
Plum wine is good.

102
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,000
You're still alive.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,200
It's surprising that plum wine

104
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,280
could do this to you.

105
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,240
Do you like me?

106
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,640
I thought even the magpies in the garden

107
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,960
could tell it
from the way I look at you.

108
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,640
Really?

109
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,600
Why can't I tell it?

110
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,040
It seems

111
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,080
I should make it more obvious.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,840
Sober up.

113
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,000
Rong Zelan.

114
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,440
I know you want to become

115
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,280
an imperial physician

116
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,240
and clear your mother's name.

117
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,880
However, the road is full of thorns.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,840
Rong Zelan,

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,840
are you willing

120
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,080
to have a companion with you

121
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,640
on this road

122
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,200
full of thorns?

123
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
He can be your guard.

124
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,040
He can cut through thorns

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,160
and shield you from storms.

126
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,240
Your Majesty,

127
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,160
this morning, I saw the peonies
in the garden blooming brilliantly.

128
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,400
It is thanks to the blessings
of a prosperous country.

129
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,120
Mother, I couldn't have

130
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,200
made it without your wisdom.

131
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,520
Jiangnan has seen
great harvest this year.

132
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,960
Everything's good in the palace.

133
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,200
Ancestors have blessed us.

134
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,360
Indeed.

135
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,440
Well,

136
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,040
my little grandson is here.

137
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,720
Oh.

138
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,060
Your Majesty,

139
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
look,

140
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,840
he's adorable.

141
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,880
Father,

142
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,480
I have a request.

143
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,120
Could you please allow it?

144
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,640
Speak freely.

145
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,280
Having gone through this crisis,

146
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
I've realized the hardships
of women in the palace.

147
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,280
Due to gender restrictions,

148
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,120
it's inconvenient for us

149
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,480
to consult a male physician

150
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,320
sometimes,

151
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,320
thus the illness is often delayed,

152
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,400
causing much trouble.

153
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,280
I boldly ask you

154
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,200
to consider

155
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
having a female physician

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
who can provide consultations
for the women in the palace.

157
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,500
Your Majesty.

158
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,120
The Princess Consort is right.

159
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,680
Your Majesty.

160
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,240
It's inappropriate to

161
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,400
have a female officer.

162
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,720
Moreover,

163
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,160
there's no precedent

164
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,800
for a female official
throughout history.

165
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,360
Mother,

166
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,440
what do you think.

167
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,960
It's embarrassing

168
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,800
to discuss our privacy

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,920
with a male physician.

170
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,360
Your Majesty.

171
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,800
I remember you once promised

172
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,320
to allow Attendant Rong

173
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,960
to legally make diagnoses
and prescribe medicine

174
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,880
if she can prove her innocence

175
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,160
in the poisoning case
of the Princess Consort.

176
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,720
Given this,

177
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,080
if she's not a medical officer,

178
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,520
how could her work be legal?

179
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,480
Attendant Rong

180
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,560
is skilled in medicine.

181
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,000
She saved the Princess Consort
and your grandson

182
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,320
and cured the little princess and me.

183
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,680
In my opinion,

184
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,960
Your Majesty,

185
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,160
it is time to fulfill that promise.
