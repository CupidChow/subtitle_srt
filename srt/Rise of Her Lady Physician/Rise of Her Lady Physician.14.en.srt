=Rise of Her Lady Physician=

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,340
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=Cure the Plague or Die=

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,880
Wait a minute!

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,440
I have something to say.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,640
Go ahead.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
What are your last words?

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,960
I concealed the plague

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,800
because I was worried it might

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,920
lead to chaos.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,040
Ridiculous!

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,200
How could you disregard

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,040
the regulations and put

14
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,880
the palace at risk?

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,320
Lord Wu,

16
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,640
this woman is eloquent

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,520
and good at manipulating.

18
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,760
She shall be burned immediately!

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,640
Lord Feng is absolutely right.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,880
She must be punished!

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,120
Minister Wu,

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,320
Minister Feng,

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
Su Ye's pox marks have formed scabs,

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
showing signs of recovery.

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,120
Why must she be burned
according to the regulations?

26
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,040
As healers,

27
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,680
we bear the duty of saving lives.

28
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,400
In the imperial palace,

29
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,680
are the regulations
more important than human lives?

30
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,600
Lord Wu,

31
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,680
as a physician,

32
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,480
can you truly disregard human lives

33
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,040
and go against your conscience?

34
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,280
Rong Zelan.

35
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,200
Stop your sophistry.

36
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,320
Who are you to question
the palace regulations?

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,160
Since ancient times,

38
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,760
whenever there's a plague,

39
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,280
the patients should be
burned and buried deep immediately

40
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,680
to prevent its spread.

41
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,080
If I let you go

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,240
and cause the smallpox to spread,

43
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,280
who could be responsible
for such a catastrophe?

44
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,520
You're all healers.

45
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,440
Do you truly believe it is right
to disregard human lives?

46
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,320
Smallpox may be dangerous,

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,960
but with careful treatment,

48
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,880
it can also be cured.

49
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,840
Why not try to treat it?

50
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,120
When someone is infected,

51
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,600
you burn them without hesitation.

52
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,360
What if there are
hundreds or thousands of them?

53
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,720
Are you going to burn them all?

54
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,080
You'd rather watch
the patients burned to death

55
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,040
than try to save them.

56
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,360
Are you truly worthy of
the title of healer?

57
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,640
Your Majesty,

58
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,360
I agree with Attendant Rong.

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,680
As physicians,

60
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,880
we should strive to save people.

61
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,880
A plague is scary,

62
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,430
but we shouldn't avoid it forever

63
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,440
and burn every patient.

64
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
If the patient is cured,

65
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,080
we will gain valuable experience,

66
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,480
which will benefit

67
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,640
the nation and the people.

68
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,160
Your Majesty, please

69
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,920
give her a chance to treat the illness.

70
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,480
I'll keep an eye on them

71
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,520
and make sure they don't leave the room.

72
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,960
If the treatment fails,

73
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
I will

74
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,600
burn them immediately

75
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,760
to ensure everyone's safety.

76
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,920
- That's right.
- Yes.

77
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,300
Yes.

78
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,400
That makes sense.

79
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,360
She has a point.

80
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,600
Maybe we'll find a way.

81
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,440
Shut up!

82
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,840
The regulations must not be violated!

83
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,040
Light the fire!

84
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,160
Stop!

85
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Rong Zelan,

86
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,680
it's only been a few days.

87
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,320
How could you cause trouble again?

88
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
Do you know

89
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,440
what crime it is to question
the palace regulations?

90
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,600
Your Majesty,

91
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,640
I do.

92
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,360
But what I said

93
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,480
is also for the sake of
the nation and people.

94
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,200
Your Majesty, you love the people

95
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,120
and govern with benevolence.

96
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,120
How could you bear to see
the innocent die?

97
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,720
If this goes on,

98
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,520
what will the people say?

99
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,880
They'll despise the Imperial
Medical Bureau for watching people die

100
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,280
and sighing that the ruler
disregards human lives.

101
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,000
Moreover,

102
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,000
witnessing the imperial physicians

103
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,120
being burned to death,

104
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,520
they'll doubt
if there's any safe place in the world!

105
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,840
Your Majesty,

106
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,560
she is exaggerating.

107
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,280
Your Majesty!

108
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,160
If the soldiers on the frontier

109
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,920
and the farmers in the fields

110
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,520
hear that you watched
physicians being burned to death,

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,960
they wouldn't dare
to entrust their lives to the court.

112
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,280
Prescriptions Worth
a Thousand in Gold says,

113
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
"Human life is above all."

114
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
Your Majesty,
you govern with benevolence.

115
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,400
If such a precedent is set,

116
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,520
what will the history books say
a hundred years later?

117
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,480
Perhaps, "The emperor, to preserve
the peace of the inner palace,

118
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,360
destroyed his reputation
for benevolence."

119
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,600
How dare you?

120
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,320
Your Majesty, she is threatening you.

121
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,640
Your Majesty, I wouldn't dare!

122
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
I'm just concerned

123
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,720
that if the words spread,

124
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,720
the discussions among the officials

125
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,560
and the condemnation of all the scholars

126
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,160
would surely tarnish
your sacred reputation.

127
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,400
You're quite sharp-tongued.

128
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
The rules, though strict,

129
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,080
are for the security of the nation.

130
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,320
How could I risk everyone's safety

131
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,440
for the survival of one person?

132
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,920
So, does it mean

133
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,880
you believe that sacrificing one
to save the others is only natural?

134
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,040
The country is like a giant ship.

135
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,800
Sailing through stormy waves,

136
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
it must cast off burdens.

137
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,840
If I were to plunge the people

138
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,160
into danger because of one person,

139
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,240
that would truly be
a betrayal of all the people.

140
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
How could an attendant know

141
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,880
the governance balance?

142
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,880
You compare the state to a ship,

143
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,560
yet fail to see that its foundation
lies with the multitude.

144
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,760
If you abandon the people for the ship,

145
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,600
you'll lose the trust of the people.

146
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,200
Even with immense power,

147
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,280
the ship will still go down.

148
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,440
A great physician

149
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,560
safeguards the people's hearts,

150
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,160
and the emperor guards the realm.

151
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,840
Shouldn't you cherish human lives
even more than a healer does?

152
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,560
Are you certain

153
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,800
you can cure smallpox?

154
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,680
I am certain!

155
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,800
Your Majesty, don't trust her!

156
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,920
Rong Zelan is not an imperial physician.

157
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,320
Even an imperial physician
cannot guarantee success.

158
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,080
She is merely a medical attendant

159
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,240
and doesn't deserve
to heal and save people.

160
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,640
Nor does she have any experience.

161
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,480
She's just bragging

162
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,360
to save herself!

163
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,320
Your Majesty,

164
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,080
please allow me to take Su Ye into
the side room for Isolation Treatment.

165
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,720
If I fail to cure

166
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,640
the smallpox in ten days,

167
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,880
I'm willing to die
to atone for the crime

168
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,160
without any complaint!

169
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,000
If I can cure

170
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,640
the smallpox in ten days,

171
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,040
there will be an excellent remedy
for saving lives,

172
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,440
and your reputation
for benevolence and generosity

173
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,120
will spread throughout

174
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,320
the land.

175
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,160
Your Majesty,

176
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,760
this is a strategy that saves all!

177
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,640
Your Majesty,

178
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,400
I'm willing to test the medicine.

179
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,480
If I can make a contribution
to the people,

180
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,160
I would die without regret!

181
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,760
Okay.

182
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,080
Then I'll

183
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,760
give you ten days.

184
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,640
Thank you, Your Majesty!

185
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,880
Rong Zelan.

186
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,840
You're not

187
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,160
an impulsive person.

188
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,480
Why did you ask about

189
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,960
sacrificing one to save the many?

190
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,400
Did something happen?

191
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,040
Su Ye got smallpox.

192
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,640
According to the rules,

193
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,000
when there's a plague,

194
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,400
the patients shall be burned.

195
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
I'm not going to report it.

196
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,760
Will you expose me?

197
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,120
Are you sure you can cure her?

198
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,640
Yes.

199
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,320
But I suspect that someone set this up

200
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,600
to get rid of me.

201
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,680
So, you intentionally
led me to discover this.

202
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,920
Yes.

203
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,560
Now that you're aware of this matter,

204
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,120
we are on the same boat.

205
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,080
What do you want me to do?

206
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,000
I have a plan.

207
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,040
Though dangerous,
it can certainly turn the tables.

208
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,600
Lord Song, when they find out

209
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,760
that I get smallpox,

210
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,720
please invite His Majesty
to the bureau.

211
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,600
It is difficult.

212
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,600
That's why I'm asking for your help.

213
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,840
I believe you can do it.

214
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,040
In addition,

215
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,360
I'd also like to ask you
for three matters.

216
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,200
First,

217
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,880
help me confirm

218
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,040
if my roommates, Zhou Ning and Sun Yu,
have been infected.

219
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,760
Second,

220
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,720
I need medicine to treat smallpox.

221
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,120
Third,

222
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,720
please find a way

223
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,640
to make sure no one

224
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,560
comes near the quarantine room.

225
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,000
Why do I keep falling into your traps?

226
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,380
(Imperial Medical Bureau)

227
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,320
Zelan, drink the medicine.

228
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,680
Come on.

229
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,520
Are you alright?

230
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm fine.

231
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,440
Su Ye,

232
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,560
we'll definitely get through this.

233
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,400
Yes.

234
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,720
Zelan,

235
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,880
after hearing what you said
to His Majesty,

236
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,360
I really admire you.

237
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,120
I also want to be as brave as you

238
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,440
and fight for what I want.

239
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,880
Su Ye,

240
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,320
if I can't get through this,

241
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,000
remember to prepare

242
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,480
the medicine according to
the prescription I taught you

243
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,200
and keep drinking it.

244
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,720
Remember,

245
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,400
from now on, you must live for yourself

246
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,800
and your medical skills.

247
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,680
And, if possible,

248
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,080
you must live for all the women

249
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,390
who never

250
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,200
had a chance to rise as men do.

251
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,520
Okay.

252
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,160
Zelan, I got it.

253
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,120
I want to be a bird
that flies over the walls.

254
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,240
No one can trap me in a cage again.

255
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,160
Come on.

256
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,440
Be careful.

257
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,400
(It's been ten days.)

258
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,040
(Rong Zelan,)

259
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,240
(you must be safe and sound.)

260
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,480
Lord Feng, what's this about?

261
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,560
Officer Song, why are you here?

262
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,720
By order of Minister Wu,

263
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,880
I'm here to provide herbs
for Attendant Rong.

264
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,560
But Lord Feng,

265
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,880
what brings you here?

266
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,800
The deadline for Rong Zelan

267
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,400
to treat smallpox is approaching,

268
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,220
so I'm here to check on the situation.

269
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,440
If she's still plagued by the sickness,

270
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,520
I will act in accordance
with the regulations

271
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,480
and finish the two of them on the spot.

272
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,560
Rong Zelan and His Majesty
had a deal of ten days.

273
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,680
There's still an hour left.

274
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,560
Lord Feng,

275
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,600
aren't you a bit too hasty?

276
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,280
The room is in a deadly silence.

277
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,800
Perhaps they've

278
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,240
already died.

279
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,480
Lord Song, you're still trying
to win her an hour.

280
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,400
Are you really expecting her

281
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,000
to come back to life

282
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,160
in an hour?

283
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,320
Whether I believe it or not
is not important.

284
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,240
I only know that whoever

285
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,800
defy the imperial decree

286
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,960
must die!
