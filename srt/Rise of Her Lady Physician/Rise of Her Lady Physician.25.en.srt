=Rise of Her Lady Physician=

00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,340
=Episode 25=

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=This Is the Cruelest Revenge on Her!=

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,120
The Second Prince
is in critical condition.

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,480
He is unconscious,

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,680
with leg fractures,

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,120
multiple wounds,

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,640
and internal organ injuries.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,960
Moreover,

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,920
he's been poisoned.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,000
Poisoned?

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,120
What really happened?

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,300
Your Majesty,

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,280
the Second Prince heard
that the First Prince came back,

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,480
so he invited him to a horse race.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,480
However, the horses suddenly went mad.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,680
After he fell off, he was

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
trampled by the horse.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,080
Why would the fine

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,560
horses suddenly go mad?

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,360
Aye.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,600
Son!

23
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,560
My son!

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,880
My son!

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,760
How could this happen?

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,480
What happened?

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,840
Who harmed you?

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,410
Son, son!

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,400
You must save him!

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,820
Wu Chunlin,

31
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,880
do you have confidence?

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
Your Majesty,

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,560
His Highness is severely injured.

34
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,500
His organs are bleeding,

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,000
let alone the deadly poison.

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,480
With such severe injuries,

37
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,600
I'm afraid

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,000
it's nearly impossible...

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,840
Shut up!

40
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,120
No matter how slim the chance,

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,680
you must try your best to save him.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,720
Otherwise, I will hold you accountable!

43
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,520
Your Majesty, regarding
His Highness's condition,

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,400
I'm afraid only a laparotomy
might be able to save him.

45
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,920
Nonsense!

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,360
A laparotomy

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,200
is a near-death gamble.

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,520
I suggest conservative treatment.

49
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,940
Rong Zelan,

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,080
what are you really up to?

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,880
Do you want to harm my son?

52
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,880
Your Grace,

53
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,640
I have no grudge against His Highness.

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,560
Why would I harm him?

55
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,800
Rong Zelan,

56
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,760
can the method

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,560
really save my son?

58
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,880
Your Majesty,

59
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,240
Divine Healer Hua Tuo

60
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,520
was a pioneer in ulcer treatment.

61
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,920
He successfully removed malignant tumors

62
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,920
and sutured the stomach and intestines.

63
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,280
I believe that

64
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
with full preparation,

65
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,160
it is worth a try.

66
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,760
Your Majesty.

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,280
I once heard military doctors mention
the method of laparotomy.

68
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,880
Many wounded soldiers

69
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,440
survived thanks to this method.

70
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,560
It is not baseless.

71
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,600
We don't have much time.

72
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,640
Please make a decision.

73
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,240
Someone,

74
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,200
summon Elder Zhong.

75
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,400
Your Majesty, my master is aged,

76
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,840
and his hands were once injured.

77
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,800
Now he can no longer
perform ulcer surgery.

78
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,080
Wu Chunlin,

79
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,840
is there anyone who can do this?

80
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,400
Your Majesty,

81
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,480
the border is at war,

82
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,720
and all the ulcer doctors

83
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,240
are in the army.

84
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,680
We're useless!

85
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,200
None of you can do this!

86
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,920
What use do you have?

87
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,840
How could this happen?

88
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,840
(The Second Prince is innocent,)

89
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,280
(but Consort Ning
caused my mother's unjust death.)

90
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,720
(If the prince dies,)

91
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,080
(Consort Ning will be in extreme pain.)

92
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,080
(This is certainly)

93
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,280
(the cruelest revenge on her.)

94
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,360
Zelan, keep in mind that

95
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,760
benevolence of a healer

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
knows no status.

97
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,960
Even if they're beggars

98
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,240
or prisoners,

99
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,040
they should be treated equally
with the nobles.

100
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,720
Since we've learned medical skills,

101
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,800
we should treat people with benevolence,

102
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,040
regardless of their wealth,

103
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,600
gender,

104
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,080
or age.

105
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,400
All lives

106
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,560
are equal.

107
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,480
We should try our best to save them.

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,840
Okay.

109
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,120
Your Majesty,

110
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,320
I can perform ulcer surgery.

111
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,720
Zelan,

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,400
how did you learn

113
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,880
such a perilous method?

114
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,080
My Lord,

115
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,120
when I worked in the Ji'an Office,

116
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,360
I learned ulcer treatment
from Elder Zhong.

117
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,440
Rong Zelan,

118
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,480
are you sure

119
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,600
you can save my son?

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,840
I'm sure.

121
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,120
But I have to know what poison it is.

122
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,600
I can't carry out a surgery

123
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,960
unless the poison is gone.

124
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,800
If it penetrates the organs,

125
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,320
no one can save him.

126
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,320
It's Soul-breaking Herb.

127
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,960
The poison is Soul-breaking Herb!

128
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,000
How do you know?

129
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,680
Rong Zelan...

130
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,920
Rong Zelan, I beg you to save my son!

131
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm begging you! If you can save him,

132
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,120
I'll give you anything you want!

133
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,240
I'm begging you!

134
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
Your Grace,

135
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,640
I think you know
what I really want, right?

136
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
I know.

137
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,200
I admit it.

138
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,920
Back then, it was me

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,240
who schemed to harm your mother

140
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,200
and caused her tragic death.

141
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,560
Rong Zelan,

142
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,040
I'll admit whatever you want me to say!

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,520
But please!

144
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,360
Please save my son!

145
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,200
Consort Ning,

146
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,520
I can't believe it!

147
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,800
Your Majesty,

148
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,800
save His Highness first.

149
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,440
His life is the top priority right now.

150
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,840
As for other things,

151
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,040
we'll talk about it later.

152
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,480
Okay.

153
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,760
Minister Wu,

154
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,200
we still need to discuss

155
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,600
the method of detoxification

156
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,760
and laparotomy.

157
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,040
Okay.

158
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,720
Everyone, stay calm.

159
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,890
Prepare the medicine

160
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,080
according to the prescription.

161
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,080
Don't make any mistakes.

162
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,350
Aye.

163
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,200
The decoction must be prepared
before nightfall.

164
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,520
After nightfall,
poor visibility will make

165
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,840
the laparotomy more dangerous.

166
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,800
Aye.

167
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,920
Let's go!

168
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,880
Lord Wu.

169
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,440
Attendant Rong,

170
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,840
His Highness has taken

171
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,120
the antidote.

172
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,720
We're here to assist you.

173
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,640
If you need us for anything,

174
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,160
just give your instructions.

175
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,760
Minister Wu,

176
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,800
when the surgery begins,

177
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,520
I'll first use acupuncture
to relieve his pain.

178
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,840
Please help me monitor his pulse.

179
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,800
Okay.

180
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,520
Physicians, please assist me
in the laparotomy.

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,480
You must be very focused

182
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,680
and do as I say.

183
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
Aye.

184
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,040
Lord Song,

185
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,280
it's getting late.

186
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,840
The candles are bright,

187
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,640
but I need more sufficient lighting

188
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,400
to see the details clearly.

189
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,320
Leave it to me.

190
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,680
Acupuncture kit.

191
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,880
I'll use the Soul-fixing Needle

192
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,680
to seal his key acupoints

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,040
to prevent excessive bleeding.

194
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,880
She used it this way.

195
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,280
I inserted the needles
into the Shenshu Acupoint,

196
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,150
Weizhong Acupoint,

197
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,040
and Zusanli Acupoint.

198
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,280
What technique is this?

199
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,320
Acupuncture

200
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,400
for local anesthesia.

201
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
With my Soul-fixing Needle,

202
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
it can ensure
that he won't wake up midway

203
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,600
because of pain.

204
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,320
The needle technique is truly profound.

205
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,120
The anesthesia is done.

206
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,800
We shall begin.
