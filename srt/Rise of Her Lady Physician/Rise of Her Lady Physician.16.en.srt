=I Will Tear Your Mouths Apart=

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,040
Su Ye!

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,920
Su Ye!

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,440
Su Ye!

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,200
Idiots!

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,680
How dare you use lethal force?

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,350
Su Ye!

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,760
Su Ye!

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,040
Zelan...

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,960
I didn't mean to stain

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,880
Consort Ning's dress.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,160
Someone deliberately tripped me.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,720
I...

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,760
I told Her Grace,

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,200
but she wouldn't believe me.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,000
I've just learn to say no.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,560
I want to become someone like you.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,440
But...

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,280
It's too late.

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,400
Su Ye!

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,240
Su Ye!

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,360
No!

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
Su Ye!

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,160
Su Ye!

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,960
Su Ye!

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,600
Su Ye!

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,840
Sorry, I couldn't protect you!

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,640
Zelan,

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,320
I want to be as brave as you

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,680
and fight for what I want.

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
I want to be a bird
that flies over the walls.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,480
No one can trap me in the cage again.

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,080
(Su Ye's death)

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,000
(will not be in vain.)

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,440
It's all my fault!

38
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,620
(Imperial Medical Bureau)

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,160
Zelan,

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,400
Consort Rou summons me.

41
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,240
The Empress Dowager is in poor health.

42
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,800
Follow me to make a diagnosis.

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,320
(I can finally meet
the Empress Dowager.)

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,560
Aye.

45
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,520
Get out!

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,480
I've told you to stay away from me!

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,320
Don't you understand?

48
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

49
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,140
(Empress Dowager)

50
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,620
(Consort Ning)
Oh!

51
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,800
Who's the blind fool

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,880
(Consort Rou)
that upset the Empress Dowager?

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,680
Greetings, Your Majesty.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,080
Stop!

55
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,440
Don't come over.

56
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,520
This is

57
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,360
a century-old ginseng
I especially prepared.

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
It's very nourishing.

59
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,960
You're thoughtful.

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,040
If nothing else,

61
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,560
you all may leave.

62
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm

63
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,720
not ill.

64
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Your Majesty,

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,080
let Minister Wu take a look.

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Anger may harm your health.

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Enough.

68
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,000
I know my

69
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,160
health condition well.

70
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,600
If nothing else,

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,560
just leave.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
Your Majesty,

73
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,040
I've heard that His Majesty
is very filial.

74
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,600
You're currently unwell.

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
If you avoid treatment and get worse,

76
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,440
His Majesty will be deeply worried.

77
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,880
I boldly ask you

78
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,640
to allow Minister Wu to take your pulse.

79
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,720
Why haven't I

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,600
seen this

81
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,200
medical attendant before?

82
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,640
Your Majesty,

83
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,440
the previous one was transferred,

84
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,000
and this is Attendant Rong,
who just got promoted.

85
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,320
She's also a disciple of Elder Zhong.

86
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Are you the daughter of Liu Fuling?

87
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,120
Back then, your mother
harbored ill intentions.

88
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,880
Now you also want to harm me!

89
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,600
It's not true!

90
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,680
Since childhood, I've been
studying medicine

91
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,030
and determined to save lives.

92
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,600
I would never harm anyone.

93
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,920
Your Majesty,

94
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,160
if you don't like her,

95
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
just cast her out

96
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,000
so that you won't get angry.

97
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,280
Okay.

98
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,920
Do as Consort Rou said.

99
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,960
Your Majesty!

100
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,320
There must've been
some misunderstanding

101
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,560
about my mother's matter.

102
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,520
Shut up!

103
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,960
How dare you defy Her Majesty's decree?

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,280
Your Majesty, please

105
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,840
give me a chance!

106
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,960
Guards, drag her down!

107
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
Your Majesty!

108
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,440
Your Majesty!

109
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,560
Please give me a chance!

110
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,280
(I must find a way
to stay in the palace.)

111
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,000
(If I'm expelled,)

112
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,360
(how can I overturn
my mother's case?)

113
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,560
Isn't this Attendant Rong?

114
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,280
I thought you'd climbed to the top.

115
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,480
It turns out you're
about to be expelled.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,240
How ridiculous.

117
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,240
Attendant Rong,

118
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,200
I heard your mother was a sinner.

119
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,840
Did you enter the palace
to harm the royal family

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,480
just like your mother did?

121
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,120
My mother is innocent.

122
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,400
She never harmed anyone.

123
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,080
If you dare to speak

124
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,360
another bad word about her,

125
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,080
I'll tear your mouths apart.

126
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,200
Remember,

127
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,520
as long as I haven't left,

128
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,400
I'm still a first-class
medical attendant.

129
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,160
Attendant Sun, Attendant Zhou,

130
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,760
have you forgotten the lesson
I taught you last time?

131
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,120
Rong Zelan,

132
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
stop bluffing.

133
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,840
You're about to be expelled.

134
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,120
Why are you still
showing off your position?

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,920
If your mother had been innocent,

136
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,000
how could she have been
demoted and expelled?

137
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,240
Like mother, like daughter.

138
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,480
You have a death wish again!

139
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
Oh, no!

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,920
Something's wrong!

141
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,920
What happened?

142
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,360
Her Majesty is gravely ill.

143
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,610
His Majesty has decreed
that we shall all be taken to

144
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,000
to the bedchamber
to receive punishment!

145
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Useless idiots!

146
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,160
My mother has been ill for months.

147
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,600
Now it has worsened,

148
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,880
but none of you can even
diagnose the illness!

149
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,040
What use are you to me?

150
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,200
Your Majesty,

151
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,280
Her Majesty used to be kind and gentle,

152
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,680
but now she's become irritable.

153
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,240
I intended to take her pulse,

154
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,400
but...

155
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,920
I was driven out.

156
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,680
I'm useless.

157
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
I couldn't take her pulse or treat her.

158
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,760
Please punish me!

159
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,680
Lord Feng and Lord Wu
took turns stepping in

160
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,080
but were both driven out!

161
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,240
There's nothing we can do!

162
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,440
If you can't diagnose the illness today,

163
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,280
I will certainly punish you!

164
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,880
(When I was in her bedroom,)

165
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,400
(aside from the incense,)

166
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,760
(there was always
a faint, strange smell.)

167
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,720
(She suddenly became irritated)

168
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,160
(and avoided contact.)

169
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,040
(Could it be...)

170
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,640
Your Majesty,

171
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,680
perhaps I can

172
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,120
diagnose the illness for Her Majesty.

173
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
She can do this?

174
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,280
Rong Zelan,

175
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,520
is this true?

176
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,160
Your Majesty,

177
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,640
Rong Zelan

178
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,600
is worried about
Her Majesty's condition.

179
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,440
She's only a first-class attendant

180
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,160
and can't take on
such a great responsibility.

181
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,200
Rong Zelan, don't ask for death.

182
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,040
Shut up!

183
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,940
Your Majesty,

184
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,150
I have some speculations at the moment.

185
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,750
For accurate diagnosis,

186
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,840
I need to approach Her Majesty

187
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,160
to confirm it.

188
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,360
Rong Zelan,

189
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,360
if you fail to diagnose the illness,

190
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,970
do you know the consequence?

191
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,160
I do.

192
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,920
Your Majesty,

193
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,520
the imperial physicians
work with full court decorum,

194
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,600
and Her Majesty can't speak freely.

195
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,520
As a woman, Attendant Rong

196
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,680
is more quick-witted.

197
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,640
I suggest we give her a chance.

198
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,080
Rong Zelan,

199
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,360
if you can

200
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,200
diagnose my mother's illness,

201
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
you'll be rewarded.

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
But if you fail,

203
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,920
all personnel involved

204
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,040
will be punished!

205
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,240
How's that possible?

206
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,960
How can we entrust our lives

207
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,480
to the hands of a medical attendant?

208
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,880
Is there no one else?

209
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,080
A woman is actually

210
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,480
going to diagnose the illness.

211
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,400
This is so inappropriate!

212
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,080
Physicians, if you have objections,

213
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,330
you may step forward

214
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,720
and go to Her Majesty's bedroom.

215
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,960
Attendant Rong isn't

216
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,960
trying to steal your thunder.

217
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
In my opinion,

218
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,040
she's saving your lives.

219
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,160
It's settled then.

220
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,320
Rong Zelan,

221
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,400
enter the room.

222
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,840
Thanks, Your Majesty.

223
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,080
I will certainly try my best.

224
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,760
Why are you still in the palace?

225
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,920
Who allowed you to come in?

226
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,880
Get out!

227
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,640
Your Majesty, calm down.

228
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,640
I only wish to treat your illness.

229
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,880
Please give me a chance.

230
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
I don't need it!

231
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,480
Get out!

232
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,560
I have a story to tell.

233
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,560
After listening to it,

234
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,440
if you're not willing,

235
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,320
I'll leave immediately.

236
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,480
Who wants to hear your story?

237
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,840
I once heard that

238
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,130
in a wealthy merchant's family
in Jiangnan,

239
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,960
the head's mother fell ill

240
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,880
yet refused to see physicians.

241
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
The filial head

242
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,040
was so worried about his mother

243
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,920
that he couldn't work.

244
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,320
In just a few months,

245
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,440
the entire household
was thrown into chaos.

246
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,440
The accounts were full of errors,

247
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,880
the servants harbored schemes,

248
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,000
and even the tenant farmers
were implicated,

249
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,640
starving all day.

250
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,320
This is just a small household,

251
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,520
let alone a nation.

252
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,200
Your Majesty,

253
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,080
if you're healthy,

254
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,680
His Majesty will relax,

255
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,200
and the realm will be stable.

256
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,040
If you're unwell,

257
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,960
His Majesty will be anxious,

258
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,160
and the court

259
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,080
and all the people

260
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,480
will be implicated.

261
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,120
The people are like children.

262
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,720
As the mother of this family, even if

263
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,160
not for yourself,

264
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,240
you should think for your children.

265
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,920
Your Majesty, please allow me

266
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,120
to diagnose and treat you.

267
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,480
Nanny, please come closer.

268
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,880
I want to tell Her Majesty something.

269
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Everyone, leave.

270
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,600
Aye.

271
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,560
If she fails,

272
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,920
we'll all be executed, right?

273
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,000
Exactly.

274
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,760
Get up.

275
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,520
Thanks, Your Majesty.

276
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,800
I'll boldly ask some questions.

277
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,760
Have you been coughing, sneezing,

278
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,960
or finding it

279
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,640
hard to control urination when hearing

280
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,840
the sound of running water,

281
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,320
even with things falling out
from the genitals

282
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,200
and difficulty in urination sometimes?

283
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,460
How dare you?

284
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,320
You...
