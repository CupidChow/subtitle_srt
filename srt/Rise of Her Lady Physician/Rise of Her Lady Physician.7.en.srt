00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,980
=Rise of Her Lady Physician=

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,340
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=Drag Her Out and Beat Her to Death=

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,120
The silver needle and pine oil
show no discoloration.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,160
The Huoshan Dendrobium
has no sulfur toxins.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,960
- It really worked.
- Rong Zelan

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,320
resolved the crisis

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,480
of damp medicinal herbs.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,200
It worked!

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,840
She really did it!

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,800
Hurry, get the ingredients
and prepare the medicine.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,360
Deliver it to Consort Li.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,680
We have no time to waste.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,760
That's wonderful.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,840
Exactly.

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,800
That's great.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,040
Feng Yin,

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,960
you framed your colleague
out of jealousy

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,880
and damaged the herbs.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
As a medical attendant,

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,640
you disregard

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,560
the benevolence of a healer

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,040
and violated the palace regulations.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,720
Do you admit your guilt?

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,760
I do.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,020
Six months' salary deducted

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,360
and three days of confinement.

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,720
If you offend again,

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,810
you'll be immediately expelled.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,840
I accept the punishment.

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,760
I keep my word.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,240
Starting today,

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,320
Rong Zelan

34
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,360
is promoted to
second-class medical attendant.

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,560
She's really promoted!

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,440
- Thank you, Minister Wu.
- That's great!

37
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,600
Uncle.

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,800
Useless!

39
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,480
Have you realized your mistake?

40
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,640
Yes, Uncle.

41
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,440
I've realized my mistake.

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,760
I shouldn't have underestimated her.

43
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,600
The medicinal herbs were damaged,

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,360
and you were punished.

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,520
What is her background?

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,000
She is nothing but the lowly daughter
of a demoted medical officer.

47
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,000
However, you were forced
to kneel and beg for mercy.

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,560
Isn't that shameful?

49
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,400
In the Imperial Medical Bureau,

50
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,160
you either step on
others' backs to climb up

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,160
or wait to be crushed into mud.

52
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,320
You must earn

53
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,800
our family's honor back.

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,120
Do you know what to do?

55
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,040
I do.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,840
Remember,

57
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,920
you must secure the position

58
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,240
of first-class medical attendant.

59
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,400
Rong Zelan.

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,320
She'll become
a stumbling block in your path.

61
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,280
You must get rid of her.

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,600
Make it clean.

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,240
Do not get our family into trouble.

64
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,600
If you can't even deal with

65
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,480
a minor medical attendant,

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,240
you'll be too incompetent

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,800
to stay in the Imperial Medical Bureau.

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,040
Go home and get married instead.

69
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,360
Uncle, rest assured.

70
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,280
I'll definitely use her lowly life

71
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
to secure our power

72
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,120
in the Imperial Medical Bureau.

73
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,640
Have you heard that

74
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,600
the new officer
is a prestigious family's heir?

75
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,160
It's Officer Song, isn't it?

76
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,720
I've never seen him

77
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,920
diagnose a patient.

78
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,520
He wanders around the corridor all day.

79
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,440
What kind of a physician is that?

80
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,140
I heard

81
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,680
he has connections in the palace.

82
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,480
How could such a worthless fool

83
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
wear the physician's robe?

84
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,200
Exactly.

85
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
Attendant Rong.

86
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,960
What's the matter, Lord Song?

87
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,480
Congratulations on

88
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,640
your promotion.

89
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,320
Your meticulous calculations

90
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,200
have really intrigued me.

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,000
At first,

92
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,880
I thought you were up to no good.

93
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,200
However, based on
my observations these days,

94
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,600
I don't think you have ill intentions.

95
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,520
I can't help but wonder

96
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,960
why you're so eager to be promoted.

97
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,280
Now that you know I'm not a bad person,

98
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,440
why ask further?

99
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,440
However, Lord Song,

100
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,240
you don't know medicine

101
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,600
but excel in martial arts.

102
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,440
You're unaware of Licorice,

103
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,200
yet you frequently visit the Case Room.

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,160
Even Minister Wu would show respect

105
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,560
when he meets you.

106
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,680
I can't help

107
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,720
but wonder why.

108
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,560
Don't be nervous, Attendant Rong.

109
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,440
You resolved a crisis

110
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,520
and saved the lives

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,680
of everyone
in the Imperial Medical Bureau.

112
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,200
You don't seem to be a bad person.

113
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,880
You saved me in the bathhouse

114
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,160
and lent me a helping hand
in the herb crisis.

115
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,720
I'll keep that in mind.

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Now that you know
I harbor no ill intentions,

117
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,720
I kindly ask you not to go further.

118
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,000
If you continue to push me,

119
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,840
I will take action to fight back.

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,920
Don't be so nervous.

121
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,520
I'm just curious.

122
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,520
What's so special about the position of

123
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,000
first-class medical attendant

124
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,160
that you'd take such a risk?

125
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
My Lord, please

126
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,440
put away your curiosity.

127
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,040
If nothing else,

128
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
I'll take my leave.

129
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,280
Well, Rong Zelan,

130
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,120
let's wait and see.

131
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,920
(I haven't eaten all day.)

132
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,880
(So hungry.)

133
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,560
(I wonder if there's any food)

134
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,960
(in the Imperial Kitchen.)

135
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,480
Who? Who's there?

136
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,820
(Imperial Kitchen)

137
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,600
(Coming to
the Imperial Kitchen this late,)

138
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,480
(is the person also hungry?)

139
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,780
(Imperial Kitchen)

140
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,640
(Could it be a palace maid)

141
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,560
(sneaking in to steal food?)

142
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,580
(Imperial Medical Bureau)

143
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,160
Have you heard?

144
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,880
Her Highness went missing last night

145
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,040
and was found in the Imperial Kitchen

146
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,600
devouring raw meat

147
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,720
and even gulping down fresh blood!

148
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,480
That's terrifying!

149
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,320
And then?

150
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,680
Later, after she was sent back,

151
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,200
she got even worse

152
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,720
and acted like she was crazy,

153
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,360
shouting that she was hungry

154
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,760
and eating whatever she saw!

155
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
Paper, hair,

156
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,800
candle...

157
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,200
She ate whatever she could get

158
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,720
without any hesitation,

159
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,840
and no one could stop it!

160
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,320
Oh my goodness.

161
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
I heard that she's been

162
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,840
afraid of drinking bitter medicine
since childhood.

163
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,840
She keeps crying when taking medicine.

164
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,560
The second-class attendant
who prepared medicine for her

165
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,440
was severely punished by Her Grace.

166
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,840
Now all the second-class
medical attendants

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,530
are avoiding this task.

168
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,840
It's more than just punishment.

169
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,060
Last month,

170
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,840
second-class attendant
who prepared medicine for her

171
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,780
got 20 strokes from Her Grace

172
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,870
and was thrown out of the palace
covered in blood.

173
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,360
She said that no matter

174
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,040
who prepares the medicine this time,

175
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,560
if Her Highness refuses to take it,

176
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,000
she'll be beaten to death!

177
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,840
Luckily, we're not
second-class attendants and don't

178
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,760
need to prepare medicine.

179
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,600
That's right.

180
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,960
In my opinion,

181
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,680
all second-class medical attendants

182
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,560
will lose their lives
because of Her Highness.

183
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,000
Which second-class attendant
can take on this task?

184
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,480
Her Grace is urging us.

185
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,440
We have no time left!

186
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,480
(Rong Zelan,)

187
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,440
(you asked for this.)

188
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,320
(There's no way
you can escape this time.)

189
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,320
Miss,

190
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,200
Attendant Rong
is exceptionally meticulous

191
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,720
in her work.

192
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,880
Why don't you let her take on the task

193
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
of preparing medicine?

194
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,320
- Oh, no!
- Attendant Rong,

195
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,360
take the prescription.

196
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,700
(Prescription)

197
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,720
(Feng Yin,)

198
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,520
(no matter what tricks you play,)

199
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,600
(you won't stop me from becoming
a first-class medical attendant.)

200
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,140
(Princess Jinyi, Consort Li)

201
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,080
Jinyi, my sweetheart.

202
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,800
Come on.

203
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,440
Be a good girl.

204
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Your Highness, please take the medicine.

205
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,560
Jinyi, come on,

206
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,920
take the medicine, and I'll

207
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,760
give you the shadow puppet
you've always wanted,

208
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,600
okay?

209
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,520
Come on.

210
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,800
I don't want to!

211
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,760
The medicine is too bitter!

212
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,600
I don't want to drink it!

213
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,160
I don't want to!

214
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,760
What is wrong with you all?

215
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,080
Can't you even get the princess
to take her medicine?

216
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,240
You've been well fed and paid.

217
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,400
Is disappointing me
all you are capable of?

218
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,600
Your Grace, forgive me.

219
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,760
I've repeatedly told
the Imperial Medical Bureau

220
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,080
to make sure the medicine is not bitter!

221
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,000
Why is the medicine
still too bitter to drink?

222
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,320
Have you ever taken my words seriously?

223
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,720
Do you think I am easy to fool?

224
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,800
Your Grace, forgive me.

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,480
Please give me another chance.

226
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,760
I've given the Imperial Medical Bureau
too many chances.

227
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,440
Someone, drag out the attendant
who prepared the medicine

228
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,560
and beat her to death!

229
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,270
Your Grace,

230
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,800
please give me another chance!

231
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,920
I'll definitely prepare something
Her Highness will drink.

232
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,800
Why should I believe you?

233
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,360
Your Grace,

234
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,430
half a month ago,

235
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,600
when I was reading the classics
in the Imperial Pharmacy,

236
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
I discovered a method
to help children take medicine

237
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,080
in the historical records
of the previous dynasty.

238
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,440
I can't remember it clearly.

239
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,320
I humbly request Your Grace
to allow me to search for it.

240
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,960
If it doesn't work,

241
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,560
I'll accept any punishment.

242
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,240
Okay, if she refuses
to take the medicine,

243
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,240
I'll cut out your tongue!

244
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,720
Thank you, Your Grace.

245
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,760
I will not let you down.

246
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,400
It's alright.

247
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,000
Her Highness's illness is not ordinary.

248
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,680
She needs to take medicine,

249
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,480
but all medicine is bitter.

250
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,280
I got it.

251
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,040
Have you heard?

252
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,760
Rong Zelan was almost dragged away
and beaten to death!

253
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,720
How is Zelan?

254
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,320
Is she okay?

255
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,480
Zelan!

256
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680
Are you okay?

257
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,840
Did you get hurt?

258
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,000
(Consort Li's got a fierce temper.)

259
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,360
(How could she go easy on her?)

260
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,360
Attendant Rong,

261
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,720
why are you staring at me?

262
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,320
Feng Yin,

263
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,880
stop pretending to be confused.

264
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
I know exactly

265
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,240
what you're up to.

266
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,370
Attendant Rong, what do you mean?

267
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,920
I really don't understand.

268
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,800
What did you do?

269
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,400
Attendant Feng, don't get me wrong.

270
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,680
I just saw some dust

271
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,600
and patted it off for you.

272
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,480
They all saw it.

273
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,800
It seems I got you wrong.

274
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,360
Attendant Feng, why do you look so pale?

275
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,640
Are you ill?

276
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,320
Maybe I can tell

277
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,200
Minister Wu you need a day off.

278
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,160
No need.

279
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,080
Yin, are you alright?

280
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,660
(Two Days Later)

281
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,400
Attendant Feng,

282
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,040
I heard Rong Zelan went to
deliver medicine to Her Highness again.

283
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,320
Her Grace was furious last time.

284
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,920
I'm sure she'll be punished.

285
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,400
I wonder

286
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,360
if she can survive.

287
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,520
(I had secretly added Coptis
to the medicine.)

288
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,880
(There's no way)

289
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,440
(she can get lucky.)

290
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,600
Of course, I can survive.

291
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,960
Didn't Her Highness
give you a hard time?

292
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,560
Why would she?

293
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,000
Sort these herbs for me.

294
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,840
(It's impossible.)

295
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,560
(She must've played)

296
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,760
(some nasty tricks.)

297
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,880
(I must expose her!)
