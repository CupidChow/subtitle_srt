00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,840
Everyone out!

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,200
I only want

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,960
Rong Zelan to stay.

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,060
This...

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,400
Mother,

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,560
but Rong Zelan

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,880
made a mistake in the treatment.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,840
It has nothing to do with her.

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,400
Your Majesty,

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,660
perhaps Her Majesty

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,160
has heard some rumors.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,280
Here's my decree.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,720
Find those

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,080
who spread rumors

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,160
within three days

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,840
and execute them all!

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,280
Aye!

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,280
Never mind.

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,400
Let them say it.

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,440
They're not wrong.

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,040
Your Majesty.

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,920
Do you know an ancient female general

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,240
named Fu Hao?

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,920
She fought on the frontiers

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
and conducted sacred rites,

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,240
yet she fell ill due to childbirth.

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,000
However, her husband King Wu
and her son Zu Jia

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,320
never despised her

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,920
but cast a vessel for her.

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,440
Even now, the oracle bones
bear the words

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,280
"Fu Hao Giving Birth to Jia."

35
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,520
This is people's respect for her.

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,130
Your Majesty, you are the same.

37
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,160
You've had children

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,400
and managed palace affairs.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,040
You've nurtured
such a wise and virtuous emperor.

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,640
When people speak of you,

41
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
they will all respect

42
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,280
and love you.

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,800
Son,

44
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,400
I'm just too old,

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,880
and I'm sorry

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,960
to have made you worry.

47
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,400
Mother, please don't say that.

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,120
You've done so much

49
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,640
for me and this nation.

50
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,480
I've seen it with my own eyes

51
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,600
and kept it in my heart.

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,720
I only wish

53
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,430
I could share your burdens back then.

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,160
Mother,

55
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,440
from now on,

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,040
I will do whatever it takes
to protect you.

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,640
I won't allow anyone to upset you again.

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,440
Your Majesty.

59
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Everyone comes from
the womb of a mother.

60
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,000
For the continuation of life,

61
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,600
every mother

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,040
has gone through struggles

63
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,080
and suffered from illnesses.

64
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
What fault is there

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,160
in being a mother?

66
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,960
Why should you be ashamed of this?

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
Those ignorant rascals

68
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,560
should be ashamed

69
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,760
of joking about
illnesses from childbirth.

70
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,080
Forget it.

71
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,240
Girl.

72
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,520
If it weren't for you,

73
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,200
I would've been

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,240
too ashamed to live.

75
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
You can not only heal

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,160
but say

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,920
something

78
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,640
so thoughtful.

79
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,560
It must've been hard for you.

80
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,760
Song Lingxiao,

81
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,720
Rong Zelan,

82
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
accept rewards.

83
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,280
You two worked together

84
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,680
to not only cure my mother

85
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,960
but also loosen the knot

86
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,160
in her heart.

87
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,180
Rong Zelan,

88
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,440
you will serve in the bureau

89
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,800
as a first-class medical attendant
and pharmacist.

90
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Song Lingxiao, you're

91
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
promoted to
First Rank Imperial Attendant

92
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
of Supervision,

93
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,360
with access to the Study.

94
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,640
Thank you, Your Majesty,

95
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,760
Empress Dowager.

96
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,000
- I'll
- I'll

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,520
certainly try my best

98
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,640
to repay your grace.

99
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,960
(Rong Zelan,)

100
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,520
(I underestimated you.)

101
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,120
(You survived again.)

102
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,400
(A Few Days Ago)
Today, Her Majesty

103
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,720
dismissed everyone,

104
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,680
and the incense in the room

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,590
was more intense than usual.

106
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,680
When Rong Zelan took the pulse,
she requested to be alone,

107
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,640
and Her Majesty actually agreed.

108
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,360
In the deep palace,

109
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,600
if there is any illness

110
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,560
that needs to be kept secret,

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,880
it must be a woman's private ailment.

112
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
That incense

113
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,720
is probably to cover up the smell.

114
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,920
Rong Zelan, well done.

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
Spread rumors
about Her Majesty's illness

116
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,240
throughout the palace.

117
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,560
Remember,

118
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,280
the bigger the commotion, the better.

119
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,800
Aye.

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,560
Lord Feng, your hands

121
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,280
are steadier than before.

122
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
Your Grace is of noble status.

123
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,520
I'll

124
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,760
certainly spare no effort.

125
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,740
Rong Zelan

126
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,440
has escaped death several times,

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,840
and now

128
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,680
she's gained the favor of Her Majesty.

129
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm afraid

130
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,720
she might ruin your plan.

131
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,320
Why should we fear?

132
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,400
She wants to climb higher,

133
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,920
so let's lend her a helping hand.

134
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,080
First Princess Consort
is about to give birth.

135
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,200
This is the perfect opportunity.

136
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,360
Your Grace, you mean...

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,120
Use obstructed labor

138
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,360
to get rid of her.

139
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,240
She'll find out sooner or later

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,680
that I'm the one
who caused her mother's death.

141
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
She'll definitely seek revenge.

142
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,560
Now she's clinging to Her Majesty

143
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,840
because she needs more support.

144
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
She wants to climb higher,

145
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,080
and the royal bloodline
will be her best ladder.

146
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,640
Once she gets involved
in the childbirth matter,

147
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,560
find a way to cause

148
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,440
problems with the fetus.

149
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,000
In this way,

150
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,880
we can not only cut off
the bloodline of the First Prince

151
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,880
but also remove a major threat.

152
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,830
Brilliant plan, Your Grace.

153
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,480
Please rest assured.

154
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,280
I'll certainly handle it well for you.

155
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,080
For the future

156
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,120
of Your Grace and the Second Prince,

157
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,480
I'm willing

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
to do anything.

159
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,640
Greetings, Your Grace.

160
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,880
Don't be polite.

161
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,080
Have a seat.

162
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,960
You must be wondering

163
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,680
why I summoned you here today.

164
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
Yes.

165
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,900
Your Grace, you'd wanted
to expel me from the palace.

166
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,040
I thought you disliked me.

167
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,100
However, when my life was at risk,

168
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,020
you pleaded for me.

169
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,040
I've been so puzzled.

170
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,800
Everyone out.

171
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,600
Zelan.

172
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,360
Your mother and I

173
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,200
were once close friends.

174
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,720
That day, in Her Majesty's room,

175
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,440
I learned about your identity

176
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,280
and was very surprised.

177
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,160
I knew you didn't enter the palace

178
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,080
just to become a medical attendant.

179
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,880
However, everything is

180
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,400
complicated in the palace.

181
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,680
One mistake,

182
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,640
and you'll fall into the abyss.

183
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,440
I don't want you
to end up like your mother.

184
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,960
I've failed her already.

185
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,440
I cannot let anything happen

186
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,800
to her only child!

187
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,680
That's why
I've tried to expel you many times.

188
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,440
Your Grace,

189
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,720
do you know something about my mother?

190
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,280
Could you tell me

191
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,240
the cause of her death?

192
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,360
Back then,

193
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
I got pregnant soon

194
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,400
after coming here.

195
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,160
Your mother often came to
the palace to visit me.

196
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,440
Later,

197
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,840
Consort Ning feared
that I'd give birth to a prince

198
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,960
and threaten her position,

199
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
so she devised a scheme

200
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,280
to get rid of the baby.

201
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,600
Your mother saw through the plot

202
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,640
and saved me.

203
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,040
However,

204
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,600
she offended Consort Ning
because of this.

205
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,440
That's why

206
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,040
she was framed and died unjustly!

207
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,800
It's her.

208
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll definitely find the evidence

209
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
and make her pay the price

210
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,040
with blood!

211
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,380
Zelan!

212
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,630
Consort Ning holds
overwhelming power in the palace,

213
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,940
and her father

214
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,480
is the Guardian Grand General

215
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,440
who controls the army.

216
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,760
Now you're only a medical attendant.

217
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,360
How's it possible to overturn the case?

218
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,560
I'm afraid

219
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,840
you'd only die in vain.

220
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,360
Zelan.

221
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,520
Promise me.

222
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,480
Leave the palace right away.

223
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,200
Your mother

224
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,000
wouldn't want you to take risks.

225
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
She'd only want you to live

226
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,160
a peaceful life.

227
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,400
Your Grace,

228
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,400
I can't leave.

229
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,000
As a medical attendant,

230
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,800
I'm even more aware

231
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,760
of the injustice my mother

232
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,240
suffered in the medical field.

233
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,240
I must find evidence

234
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,400
to expose the crimes of Consort Ning

235
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,360
and clear my mother's name.

236
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,840
I'll also become a medical officer

237
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,280
to break the prejudice
that women can't practice medicine.

238
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,280
This is

239
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,360
the best proof for my mother.

240
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,640
Attendant Rong.

241
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,800
Lord Song.

242
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,960
Looking for Minister Wu?

243
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,080
Minister Wu caught a cold

244
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,160
and just went back.

245
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,880
I'm here to see you.

246
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,080
Me?

247
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,080
Yes.

248
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,360
What do you need?

249
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,960
Since the first time we met,

250
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,280
I've had a feeling

251
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,420
that you're not

252
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
a simple medical attendant.

253
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,360
Not long ago, I happened to overhear

254
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,320
the conversation
between you and Consort Rou

255
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,880
and learned why you entered the palace

256
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,120
and

257
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,000
who the enemy is.

258
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,440
You eavesdropped?

259
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,640
- I...
- Are you going to

260
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,560
report me to Consort Ning?

261
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,080
I'm here to

262
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,920
seek cooperation.

263
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,880
I already know

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
your true purpose.

265
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,720
To show my sincerity,

266
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,880
I'll also tell you

267
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,920
the truth.

268
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,680
I'm the son of
the First Princess and Marquis Xuanping.

269
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,480
I joined the bureau to investigate

270
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
the successive deaths
of the imperial children.

271
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,560
Go ahead.

272
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,720
Rong Zelan.

273
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,320
I'm a princess's son.

274
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,360
Aren't you even surprised?

275
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,280
Get to the point.

276
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,080
Okay.

277
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,000
The point is,

278
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,720
based on my investigation these days,

279
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,640
I suspect that Consort Ning

280
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,000
is the mastermind behind this.

281
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,400
Now that we share the same goal,

282
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,810
rather than fighting alone,

283
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,190
we should work together.

284
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,840
What do you think?

285
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,600
Okay.

286
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,080
Glad to work with you.

287
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,480
Glad to work with you.

288
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,120
Glad to work with you.

289
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,200
I thought you'd refuse me.

290
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,760
Lord Song.

291
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,280
Greetings, Grandmother.

292
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,340
(First Princess Consort)
Get up.

293
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,280
You're pregnant.

294
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,440
No need for courtesy.

295
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,240
Come here and sit down.

296
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,880
Talk with me.

297
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,440
Well,

298
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,720
I'm trapped here all day,

299
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,900
feeling so restless.

300
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,520
Grandmother,

301
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,920
seeing you in such good spirits,

302
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,380
I feel

303
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,240
so delighted.

304
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
You look a bit pale today.

305
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,500
Are you

306
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,590
feeling unwell?

307
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,480
I'll summon the physician over

308
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,400
to take your pulse.

309
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,160
Grandmother.

310
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,620
It's just that

311
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,120
I've been a bit tired lately.

312
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,160
It's nothing serious.

313
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,600
I only need to rest for a few days.

314
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
(Her Highness seems
to have a hidden illness.)

315
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,040
(This is a rare opportunity.)

316
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,480
(I have to cure
more women in the palace)

317
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,880
(to show people)

318
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,520
(that female physicians
are necessary in the palace.)

319
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,560
Your Majesty,

320
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,520
I wonder if I can check on Her Highness.

321
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,920
Attendant Rong

322
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,020
has been taking care of me,

323
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,080
and I'm much better now.

324
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,520
Let her check on you as well.

325
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,400
Your Highness,

326
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,640
don't be nervous.

327
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,360
Prepare the medicine according to

328
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,720
this prescription every day.

329
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,640
It can replenish energy and blood.

330
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,920
Aye.

331
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,800
Your Highness,

332
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,960
if someone sends novel food or items,

333
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,800
examine them carefully before using.

334
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
After all, there are
too many people in the palace,

335
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,120
and gifts may come from
all kinds of sources.

336
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,080
It's possible

337
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,880
that something inappropriate
might be mixed among them.

338
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Thank you, Attendant Rong.

339
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,960
I'll be careful.

340
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,720
Your Highness, no need to thank me.

341
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,160
This is my duty.

342
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,520
Then I shall take my leave.

343
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,000
Lord Song,

344
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,280
why are you here?

345
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,040
I came to take
Her Majesty's peace pulse.

346
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,040
Can you do that?

347
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,400
Maybe I can.

348
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,720
(Maybe I should change)

349
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,240
(the prescription)

350
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,440
(for Her Highness's illness.)

351
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,200
Something's wrong!

352
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,640
Premature childbirth!

353
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,800
It is critical!

354
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,320
The Eastern Palace urgently summoned
everyone from the bureau!

355
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,520
(Oh, no!)

356
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,800
(I knew it.)
