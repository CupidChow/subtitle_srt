=The Idiot Who Can't Taste=

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,380
This...

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,960
Why is she wearing mourning attire?

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,360
Rong Zelan, what are you doing?

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,680
Father.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,860
(Tablet of the Beloved Mother, Lady Liu)
Mom just died

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,440
seven days ago,

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,360
and you can't wait to make your concubine
the legitimate wife.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,520
Uncles, Aunties,

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,360
you must've heard

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,240
that my mom died of strokes due to

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,560
breach of the imperial rules.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,440
But the truth is

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,400
she was wronged,

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
and when she was dying,

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,880
her husband

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,240
forbade anyone

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,280
to save her life!

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,200
I can't believe it!

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,480
He's such a monster!

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,400
My mom

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,960
died in a house full of physicians

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,440
with no one trying to help.

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,600
She'll never rest in peace!

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,320
This is outrageous!

28
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,520
Today,

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,560
I must reveal

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,160
your true colors

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,800
and tell everyone

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,760
that you're an ungrateful
and heartless hypocrite!

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,280
Y-You ungrateful girl!

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,480
How dare you lie

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,600
and tarnish my name?

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,360
You might not know this.

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,040
Soul-fixing Needle,
the so-called Rong family's

38
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,240
secret skill that helped my father,
a minor official,

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,240
make it to the vice minister
of the Imperial Medical Bureau,

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,720
was actually

41
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,440
developed by my mother!

42
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,680
You...

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,880
Someone, take this unruly girl down

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,880
and give her 100 strokes,

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,160
regardless of whether she dies!

46
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,940
I'll keep telling the truth

47
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,520
(Tablet of the Beloved Mother, Lady Liu)
until I die!

48
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,000
My mom died of injustice!

49
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,560
My mom died of injustice!

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,680
Died of injustice!

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,840
He watched her die!

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
What a monster!

53
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,170
Zelan!

54
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,040
Zelan!

55
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
He's a devil!

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,040
Hit her hard!

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,480
Unruly girl!

58
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,560
You've been lying and talking nonsense!

59
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,780
She's just a kid!

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,640
(Liu Fuling)

61
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,560
(I've finally got everything)

62
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,640
(that my children and I deserve.)

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,920
Beat her to death!

64
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,650
Brother, please stop!

65
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,000
Stop!

66
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,720
Zelan's mother died early.

67
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,880
She couldn't take it,

68
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,280
so she talked nonsense.

69
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,680
Please have mercy!

70
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,800
Don't try to persuade me.

71
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,480
Keep beating her!

72
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,360
Zelan!

73
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,450
Just apologize to your dad!

74
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,640
Stop being so stubborn!

75
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,890
If they don't stop,

76
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,790
you'll die!

77
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,330
The wedding will turn into a funeral!

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,700
This...

79
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,670
Stop!

80
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,440
Enough!

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,080
You'll beat her to death!

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,870
Elder,

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,320
Zelan is just a kid.

84
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,720
She doesn't deserve to die!

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
For the sake of our ancestors

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,870
and my late husband,

87
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,400
please tell them to stop!

88
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,960
That's right.

89
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,800
Exactly.

90
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,120
- She's just a kid.
- Stop it.

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,960
Enough.

92
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,800
This is over.

93
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,720
Let's go.

94
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,600
Zelan!

95
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,600
Zelan!

96
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,960
Get the medicine!

97
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,200
- Aye!
- Hurry!

98
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,800
Zelan!

99
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,280
Zelan!

100
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,480
Mom...

101
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Mom...

102
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I'm here.

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm with you.

104
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
Zelan,

105
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,240
how could you be so stupid?

106
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,720
You're just a kid.

107
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,960
How could you go against your dad?

108
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,400
From now on,

109
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,520
do not defy your dad ever again.

110
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,640
You have to live.

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,720
Only in this way can your mom

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,960
rest in peace!

113
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,680
You and Mom

114
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,480
are right.

115
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,720
I have to live.

116
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,360
I need to grow up.

117
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,160
When I grow up,

118
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,920
I'll be able to deal with them.

119
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,640
Stupid girl...

120
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,760
Bow to each other!

121
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,680
(I'll behave myself,)

122
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,960
(hide my talents,)

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,320
(live, and grow up.)

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,880
(When I'm powerful enough,)

125
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,960
(I'll definitely uncover the truth
and clear my mom's name.)

126
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,880
(You will all pay the price)

127
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,880
(for what you did!)

128
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,660
(Rong Mansion)

129
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,920
Pat a cake,

130
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,640
pat a cake...

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,780
What are you writing?

132
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,960
Bake me

133
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,240
a cake...

134
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,520
Miss Zeyan,

135
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,440
these are the spoiled buns you asked for.

136
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,920
Are you sure

137
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,680
they're all spoiled?

138
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,680
I'm sure.

139
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,080
These were left over from three days ago.

140
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,760
Sister,

141
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,280
I know you didn't have breakfast,

142
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,080
so I got you some buns.

143
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
Have a taste.

144
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,520
Zeyan,

145
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,470
you're so kind.

146
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,620
I'm hungry right now.

147
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,840
Rong Zelan,

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,480
did you starve to death
in your past life?

149
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,760
They're all spoiled,

150
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,360
but you enjoy it so much.

151
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,160
What an idiot!

152
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,960
Rong Zelan, you're so stupid.

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,720
You can't even tell if they've gone bad.

154
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,640
They stink!

155
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,760
Idiot!

156
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,280
You can't even tell if they're spoiled.

157
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,760
What an idiot!

158
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,720
Idiot!

159
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,730
Idiot!

160
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,320
Idiot, you stink!

161
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Idiot,

162
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,080
keep eating them!

163
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,380
(Rong Zelan)

164
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,680
(Rong Zeyan)
Trying to fight back?

165
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,080
Rong Zelan, are you out of your mind?

166
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,280
Rong Zeyan,

167
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
it's been ten years.

168
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,960
It's your turn to taste the spoiled buns.

169
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,400
- You...
- Stop!

170
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,240
This school is a place for learning.

171
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,560
Have you no sense of decency?

172
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,880
Elder, Father,

173
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,920
Rong Zelan somehow lost her mind.

174
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
She started it.

175
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,120
Rong Zeyan,

176
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,160
you're such a good liar, aren't you?

177
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,240
You little jinx.

178
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,130
You're the one lying!

179
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,990
Enough.

180
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,160
Both of you brats,

181
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,120
shut up!

182
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
I'm here to announce

183
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,520
an important matter
that affects the future of our family.

184
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,520
The Imperial Medical Bureau
is recruiting medical attendants,

185
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,840
and luckily,

186
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,520
we have one nomination.

187
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,480
Since ancient times,

188
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,240
men from medical families like us

189
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,400
have been determined
to be imperial physicians

190
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,240
and bring honor to our families.

191
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,200
For a woman, the highest honor

192
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,120
is to enter the Imperial Medical Bureau

193
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,120
and serve as an attendant.

194
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,280
After deliberation,

195
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,600
the elders all agreed

196
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,720
that Rong Zeyan,

197
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,960
with her exceptional knowledge

198
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,240
and remarkable talent,

199
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,640
is the best candidate
to enter the Imperial Medical Bureau

200
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,360
on behalf of the family.

201
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,560
I disagree.

202
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,960
You disagree?

203
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,480
Who are you to object?

204
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,840
If your sister becomes
a medical attendant,

205
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,520
she'll bring glory to our family.

206
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,040
You'd better shut your mouth.

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,400
Father,

208
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,320
Elder,

209
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,080
according to the law
and our family rules,

210
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,800
anyone sixteen or older
may enter the Imperial Medical Bureau.

211
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,240
Our representative
to the Imperial Medical Bureau

212
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,560
carries our family's honor.

213
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,840
I think

214
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,920
we should compete fairly

215
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,240
for this position,

216
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,080
and the most capable one

217
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,280
will win.

218
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
She has a point.

219
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
Rong Zelan,

220
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,040
you can't even recognize the basic herbs,
and you want to

221
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,000
be a medical attendant?

222
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,440
Are you out of your mind?

223
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,560
Zelan,

224
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,840
your father and I

225
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,520
have evaluated all the qualified

226
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,480
candidates,

227
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,520
and Rong Zeyan is our best choice.

228
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,800
Are you questioning our decision?

229
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,880
I wouldn't dare.

230
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,560
But I want to know

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,840
how you evaluated them,

232
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,440
what the standards are,

233
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
and who witnessed it.

234
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,080
Now that you all believe

235
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,440
that Rong Zeyan excels in medicine,

236
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,360
why don't you let us

237
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,200
compete for

238
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,800
- the opportunity?
- Good idea.

239
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,720
I don't think it's appropriate.

240
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,360
Everyone knows that Zeyan

241
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,760
is outstanding among her peers.

242
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,000
Now that the elder and the head
have made a decision,

243
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
the competition is really unnecessary.

244
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,360
Rong Zeyan,

245
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,800
you always say you're the best.

246
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,960
Well, are you afraid to lose

247
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,240
to me?

248
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,320
Then let's compete.

249
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,760
How could I lose to

250
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,480
a useless loser like you?

251
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,600
In that case,

252
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,120
we'll hold a competition soon.

253
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,280
The winner will go to the palace

254
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,280
on behalf of the family.

255
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,720
Thanks, Elder.

256
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,240
How could this old fool

257
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,440
agree to let Rong Zelan compete?

258
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
And you!

259
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,720
How could you be so impatient?

260
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,160
Mother,

261
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,440
how could Rong Zelan win?

262
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,640
She's just an overconfident psycho.

263
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,040
However, Rong Zelan

264
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,680
seemed so different today.

265
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,880
She didn't act submissively

266
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,720
as she always does.

267
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,200
Is she playing tricks?

268
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,360
Mom,

269
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,160
she's lost her sense of taste,

270
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,920
eating spoiled buns for ten years.

271
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,880
Why should we be worried?

272
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,440
Zeyan,

273
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
you have to get into
the Imperial Medical Bureau

274
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,200
and help your brother become

275
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,360
an imperial physician

276
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,680
and make our family great again.

277
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
This way, we'll be able to

278
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,760
take control of the entire family.

279
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,120
Okay.

280
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,600
Zeyan,

281
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,440
too bad you're not a boy.

282
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,240
Otherwise, with your skills,

283
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,960
you'd definitely become
an imperial physician.

284
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,650
Mom,

285
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,280
being a medical attendant
can also bring honor to the family

286
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,760
and secure your power.

287
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Don't worry.

288
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
I will win tomorrow.

289
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,160
Zeyan,

290
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,480
although I've ruined her sense of taste,

291
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,240
who knows what other tricks

292
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,400
she has up her sleeve?

293
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,560
Never underestimate your enemy.

294
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,760
Mom.

295
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
Rong Zelan is just a loser

296
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,160
who can't even taste herbs.

297
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,680
A medical attendant
has to recognize all herbs.

298
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,920
I've outperformed her at everything
for a decade.

299
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,280
Just rest assured.

300
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
But nothing

301
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,160
is impossible.

302
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,480
I think

303
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,040
I need to talk to the examiner.

304
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,360
Elder,

305
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,720
I just got some fine Longjing tea.

306
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,720
You can have a taste.

307
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,920
Yueyao,

308
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,080
you're so thoughtful.

309
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,840
Elder,

310
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,160
the medical attendant candidate

311
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,680
will affect the future of our family.

312
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,080
Is the competition all set?

313
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm still thinking about it.

314
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,680
I can deal with it.

315
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,200
I heard that the Imperial Medical Bureau

316
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,640
values a medical attendant's

317
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,480
ability to taste and recognize herbs.

318
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,800
Many herbs look alike

319
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,600
but have completely different effects.

320
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,440
(100 Taels)
Just like different kinds of tea,

321
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,280
if you don't taste carefully,

322
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,920
you might get them mixed.

323
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,440
Elder,

324
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,800
don't you

325
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,480
think so?

326
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,980
(Rong Mansion)

327
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,540
Today,

328
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,960
we'll select a medical attendant

329
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,480
to go to the palace.

330
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,840
The test is
herb tasting and recognition.

331
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,800
Each candidate needs to taste

332
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,520
three bowls of herbal medicine

333
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,960
and name

334
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,400
all the herbs in the medicine.

335
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,040
The one with more correct answers

336
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,320
will win and go to
the Imperial Medical Bureau

337
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,080
as a medical attendant.

338
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,490
Rong Zelan,

339
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,080
if you surrender now,

340
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,280
I won't laugh at you.

341
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,200
I won't surrender.

342
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,680
Besides,

343
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,520
are you sure you can win?

344
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,920
Head, Elder,

345
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,640
Minister Wu is outside the mansion.

346
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,560
Lord Wu, we didn't know you were coming.

347
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,680
Sorry for

348
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,960
the inhospitality.

349
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,860
(Wu Chunlin, Minister of Medical Bureau)
Chengde,

350
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,200
I heard you were going to

351
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,320
select a medical attendant.

352
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,240
This is such a good idea.

353
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,280
I invited myself here.

354
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,280
I cannot miss this.

355
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,640
Am I bothering you?

356
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,720
Lord Wu, we're so honored

357
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,960
to have you here.

358
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,040
Please come in.

359
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,920
Okay.

360
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,120
Lord Wu, please be seated.

361
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,520
The two envelopes

362
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,200
match with the two sets of
herbal medicine behind you.

363
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,760
You will draw lots to decide
which set you will taste.

364
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,640
Minister Wu

365
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,040
will announce the final results.

366
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,880
I got the right one.

367
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,000
Well, Rong Zeyan goes first.

368
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,760
Lord Wu,

369
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,080
here's the answer.

370
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,200
The first bowl of medicine

371
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,200
is Four Gentlemen Decoction,

372
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,600
made of Codonopsis Root,
White Atractylodes Rhizome,

373
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,200
Poria, and Licorice Root.

374
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,720
The second one
is Four Substances Decoction,

375
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,720
made of Rehmannia Root, Angelica Root,

376
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,240
White Peony Root,
and Chuanxiong Rhizome.

377
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,520
She's great.

378
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,640
She's indeed outstanding.

379
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,610
Exactly.

380
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,600
Miss Zeyan is amazing.

381
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,440
Yes.

382
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,320
The third one

383
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,320
is Six-Ingredient Rehmannia,

384
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,640
made of

385
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Rehmannia Root, Cornus Fruit,

386
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,600
Dioscorea Rhizome,
Alisma Rhizome, Moutan Bark,

387
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,800
and Poria.

388
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,880
She recognized them all.

389
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,000
Lord Wu,

390
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
the candidate is my daughter, Zeyan.

391
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,800
She's smart

392
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,520
and very good at recognizing herbs.

393
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,840
Zeyan is indeed talented.

394
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,520
She was right about the first two.

395
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,920
However, for the third bowl of medicine,

396
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,760
she got

397
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,880
Rehmannia Root
and Phellodendron Bark mixed.

398
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,840
Overall, Zeyan is really impressive.

399
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,160
She can name

400
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,920
all the ingredients accurately
by tasting the medicine,

401
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,240
which shows that she's practiced this

402
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,600
for over ten years.

403
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,040
Thank you, Minister Wu.

404
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,840
Sister,

405
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,400
it's your turn.

406
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,320
(Without sense of taste,)

407
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,560
(how could you name the herbs?)
