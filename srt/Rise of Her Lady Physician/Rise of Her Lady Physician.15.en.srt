00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=Promoted to First-class Medical Attendant=

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,360
Whether I believe it or not
is not important.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,200
I only know that whoever

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,920
defies the imperial decree

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,120
must die!

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,880
Well,

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,080
Lord Song,

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,760
time is up.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,800
Still blocking the way?

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,800
(Rong Zelan,)

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,200
(did you really lose this time?)

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,640
It seems the benevolent Attendant Rong

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,000
cured others

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,280
but...

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,200
Lord Feng, sorry to
disappoint you again.

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,520
Second-class Medical Attendant Rong Zelan

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,880
lived up to expectations,

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,160
cured the smallpox plague,

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,680
and developed a new remedy.

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,200
From now on,

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,600
smallpox can be cured.

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,580
Great!

25
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,980
(Imperial Medical Bureau)

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,700
His Majesty has arrived!

27
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,780
Your Majesty.

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,620
Get up.

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,700
I heard

30
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,340
that Rong Zelan has recovered

31
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,620
and developed a remedy
for treating smallpox.

32
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,580
Your Majesty,

33
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,740
that is true.

34
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,800
I've taken their pulse and confirmed

35
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,910
that they've fully recovered.

36
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,180
Good.

37
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,780
Rong Zelan.

38
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,800
Rong Zelan prevented
the spread of the plague

39
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,340
and developed a method
to cure smallpox.

40
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,540
Today, I'll make an exception
to promote you

41
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,620
to first-class attendant.

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,860
Your Majesty,

43
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,900
thank you for your boundless grace!

44
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,180
Get up.

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,140
Be safe, Your Majesty.

46
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,580
(Mom,)

47
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,660
(I've finally become
a first-class attendant.)

48
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,140
(From now on,)

49
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,580
(I can enter the Case Room freely)

50
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,580
(to check the case records.)

51
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,180
(I must find the evidence
that proves your innocence)

52
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,020
(to clear your name.)

53
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,220
Congratulations.

54
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,500
Lord Song, thank you for saving my life.

55
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,180
No need.

56
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,380
Why don't you

57
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,420
repay me with a marriage?

58
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,700
I'm just kidding.

59
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,190
Zelan,

60
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,700
what are we eating tonight?

61
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,980
Why don't we have something delicious?

62
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,780
Isn't this Attendant Su?

63
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,860
Now you've learned to please others.

64
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,060
What a loyal dog.

65
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,540
If you love following
and serving others so much,

66
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,660
why don't you wash all our clothes?

67
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,380
Don't you have hands?

68
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,500
Can't you do it yourself?

69
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,620
Su Ye, how dare you?

70
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,370
Why did you slap me?

71
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,580
Do I need a reason?

72
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,740
Attendant Sun, are you trying to
offend your superior?

73
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,780
I'm a first-class medical attendant
appointed by His Majesty.

74
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,100
If you slap me,

75
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,140
according to the rules,
you'll get 20 strokes

76
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,220
and demoted to the Ji'an Office.

77
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,780
And your accomplice

78
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,620
will also be punished.

79
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,460
Do you two also want to
go to the Ji'an Office

80
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,460
and listen to the sound of fingernails
scratching the coffin?

81
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,140
Attendant Rong, forgive us.

82
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,580
Attendant Rong, forgive us!

83
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,140
If I catch you bullying
your colleagues again,

84
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,700
I'll definitely show you

85
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,140
that the title of first-class attendant

86
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,780
is not just for show.

87
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,820
Yes, I'll never do it again.

88
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,300
Get lost.

89
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,550
Let's go.

90
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,740
Zelan,

91
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,260
I finally have the courage
to reject others.

92
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,700
Thank you.

93
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,500
(Imperial Medical Bureau)

94
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,100
(Mom,)

95
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,780
(it took me ten years to come this far)

96
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,900
(from the Rong family.)

97
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,740
(Now,)

98
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,180
(I can finally uncover)

99
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,020
(what you went through
in the palace back then.)

100
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,220
(Case Room)
(What really happened?)

101
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,740
(Who framed you?)

102
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,460
(Case Room)
(Whoever it is,)

103
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,540
(I won't let them get away.)

104
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,740
(I'll make them wish they were dead.)

105
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,540
(They have to pay)

106
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,060
(with blood.)

107
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,940
(Case Room)

108
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,460
(Empress Dowager Birthday Banquet Case)

109
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,060
First year of Wuyou,

110
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,140
the Empress Dowager had an asthma attack
during her birthday banquet

111
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,140
with an aversion to cold.

112
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,500
Liu Fuling diagnosed
her condition without permission,

113
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,740
deeming it to be Cold Asthma.

114
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,940
Liu Fuling used White Mustard Seed,

115
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,010
Corydalis,

116
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,900
Asarum,

117
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,060
Kansui Powder,

118
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,100
and Ginger Juice on a handkerchief

119
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,620
and let the Empress Dowager smell it.

120
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,300
When her illness showed slight relief,

121
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,940
Medical Officer Feng arrived on duty,

122
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,500
claiming that a woman's opinion
isn't worth serious consideration.

123
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,140
Since ancient times,

124
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,180
men have dominated
the field of medicine.

125
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,660
A woman's interference
will only cause trouble.

126
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,880
In the end,

127
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,660
Liu Fuling, for delaying
the Empress Dowager's treatment,

128
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,620
was punished with 80 strokes

129
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,900
and expelled from the palace

130
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,020
as a warning to others.

131
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,660
Mother's diagnosis and medication

132
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,460
were clearly right.

133
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,340
Simply because she was a woman

134
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,540
and broke the rule
that women cannot practice medicine,

135
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,940
she was unjustly suspected and punished.

136
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,300
How absurd this world is.

137
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,380
It turns out you've wanted

138
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,180
the records from ten years ago.

139
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,660
Don't get me wrong.

140
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,940
I'm here to get something.

141
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,460
I didn't mean to pry.

142
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,180
In that case,

143
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,700
please go ahead.

144
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,580
Attendant Rong,

145
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,540
you've got what you wanted.

146
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,700
Why are you still so upset?

147
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,940
My mom stood up at a critical time

148
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,020
to save others

149
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,900
yet was wrongly accused

150
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,780
of misconduct due to the absurd notion
that virtue for a woman

151
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,740
lies in her lack of talent.

152
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
She was sent to the Ministry of Justice
and beaten to death.

153
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,420
Lord Song, as a grown-up man,

154
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,460
you've enjoyed all the privileges
throughout your life.

155
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,140
Do you have any idea
how unfair this world is to women?

156
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,660
The prejudice against women has existed

157
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,300
for so long.

158
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,220
Millennia of rigid doctrine,

159
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,260
deeply entrenched,

160
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,380
cannot be broken overnight.

161
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,860
So what if it's hard to break?

162
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
If that's the case,

163
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,820
I'll carve out my own path.

164
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,060
I will show the whole world

165
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,140
that female physicians are

166
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,100
not inferior to male ones.

167
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,740
I must clear my mother's name

168
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,900
and break the rotten rule
that women cannot become physicians.

169
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,580
(Today,)

170
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,540
(I swear,)

171
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
(from now on,)

172
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,860
(I'll risk all)

173
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,900
(to break the rotten rules.)

174
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,460
(With my medical skills,)

175
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,260
(I'll become the first female
imperial physician in Great Liang.)

176
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,380
(I'll become the greatest physician)

177
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,580
(and seize the power of discourse)

178
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,460
(so that I can
bring justice to my mother)

179
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,980
(before the entire court.)

180
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,300
Attendant Rong,

181
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,700
no matter what decision you make,

182
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,020
I will

183
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,540
always be on your side.

184
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,080
Attendant Rong!

185
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Su Ye is in danger!
