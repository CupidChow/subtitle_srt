(Imperial Medical Bureau)

5
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,400
Miss Feng, I didn't expect

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,440
you'd also be willing to start

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,080
as a third-class medical attendant
just like us.

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,960
Vice Minister Feng

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,360
is your uncle.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,640
You're from a big family

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,920
and have a bright future.

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,200
From now on,

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,840
we're all counting on you, Miss Feng.

14
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,320
(Feng Yin,
Third-class Medical Attendant)

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,720
We are all sisters

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
and colleagues.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,160
We should look after each other.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,080
I heard that this new batch of herbs

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,080
is worth a fortune.

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,120
Look! Is that the Millennium Ganoderma?

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,240
This Ganoderma is so big

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,280
and bright.

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,560
It must be quite old in years.

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,920
What's wrong with you

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,770
new attendants?

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,320
This Cistanche has been damaged!

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,040
How could you be so careless?

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,040
This is a five-year-old Cistanche herb.

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,880
It's extremely precious

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,440
and worth 1000 taels of gold.

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,920
Can you afford it?

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,880
1000 taels of gold?

33
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,000
Miss Feng,

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,620
(Su Ye, Third-class Medical Attendant)
I didn't mean to!

35
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,040
I don't have enough money!

36
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,360
(Sun Yu, Third-class Medical Attendant)
Do you think your apology is enough?

37
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,120
Exactly.

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,660
(Zhou Ning, Third-class Medical Attendant)
How much could

39
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,400
her apology be worth?

40
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,320
Since she can't afford it,

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,120
I'm afraid we have to punish her
according to the rules.

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,920
Give her 20 strokes

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,440
and expel her from the palace.

44
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,540
20 strokes!

45
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,840
Steward,

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
I'm begging you.

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
Please don't expel me!

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,840
I can't be expelled!

49
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,040
I'm begging you!

50
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,320
This is the rule!

51
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,320
No need to explain.

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,680
My lord.

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,120
May I

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,920
check the herb

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,480
to see if there's a chance to remedy it?

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,040
What can she possibly do?

57
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,480
It's already damaged.

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,440
It's Cistanche.

59
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,400
Attendant Feng,

60
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,640
in my opinion,

61
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
it's just a three-year-old Cistanche.

62
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,640
It only has limited effects
and is considered

63
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,840
an inexpensive herb.

64
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,840
It's not worth a fortune.

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,240
Why did she just say
it was five years old

66
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,520
and even want to expel her?

67
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,800
This is so irresponsible.

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Attendant,

69
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,240
you say this Cistanche
is three years old.

70
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,080
Do you have proof?

71
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,240
Cistanche over five years old

72
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,800
has deep grooves like ravines

73
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,640
with an oily luster like amber.

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
But this one

75
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,120
only has loose scales

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,240
and a faint smell.

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
It's just a poorly preserved
three-year-old inferior herb.

78
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,560
Attendant Rong is right.

79
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,240
(Wu Chunlin,
Minister of the Imperial Medical Bureau)

80
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,840
Greetings, Lord Wu.

81
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,400
This Cistanche herb

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,840
is only about three years old.

83
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,600
Due to improper storage,

84
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,760
its color has deepened,

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,880
and its scales have fallen off,

86
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,240
so you mistakenly deemed
that it was five years old.

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,260
Alright.

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,680
Send this batch of new herbs
to the Imperial Pharmacy

89
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
and take care of it.

90
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,880
Hurry.

91
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
Aye.

92
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,280
Identifying herbs
is the foundation of medical skills.

93
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,240
I hope all of you can observe carefully

94
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,560
and verify rigorously

95
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,840
like Attendant Rong does.

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,520
Feng Yin.

97
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,240
As a medical attendant,

98
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,920
you even mistook the age of the herb.

99
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,280
(Feng Mingyuan, Vice Minister)
This is the first time,

100
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,440
so I won't punish you.

101
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,560
I've realized my mistake.

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,840
From now on, I'll be more careful.

103
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,560
Starting today,

104
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,670
you are officially the medical attendants
of the Imperial Medical Bureau.

105
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,680
This is Minister Wu,

106
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,440
who's in charge of
the entire Imperial Medical Bureau.

107
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,160
I'm the vice minister
of the Imperial Medical Bureau.

108
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,480
From now on,

109
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,760
I'll be responsible
for your performance reviews.

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
Now that you've entered
the Imperial Medical Bureau,

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,320
you work for the emperor
as medical practitioners.

112
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,160
Men serve as medical officers,

113
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,400
women as medical attendants,

114
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,520
each with different duties.

115
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,880
Third-class medical attendants
handle daily tasks such as

116
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,640
cleaning the medicine furnace
and medicinal dregs.

117
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,080
Do not despise the small tasks.

118
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,840
Expertise lies in these medicinal dregs.

119
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,080
Second-class medical attendants
may work in the Imperial Pharmacy,

120
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,920
dealing with various herbs day and night.

121
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,640
They prepare herbs and make medicine

122
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,280
based on the prescriptions,
no mistakes allowed.

123
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,960
As for first-class medical attendants,

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,080
they follow imperial physicians
into the inner palace to treat patients.

125
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,630
That is the highest honor
in the Imperial Medical Bureau

126
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,880
and the most dangerous duty.

127
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,960
Hope you can all

128
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,560
act prudently.

129
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,320
The deepest part here is the Case Room,

130
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
preserving

131
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,040
the case records of
the royal family members over the years.

132
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,080
It's top secret,

133
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,880
and you must not trespass.

134
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,640
(It means)

135
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,400
(the case records of my mom's)

136
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,980
(unjust accusation
of harming the Empress Dowager)

137
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,670
(must be kept in the Case Room.)

138
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,120
(If I find the case records,)

139
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,560
(I'll be able to figure out
what happened back then.)

140
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,200
Lord Feng,

141
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,640
I wonder

142
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,280
how we can enter the Case Room

143
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,360
to study the cases.

144
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,080
You're new here,

145
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,080
yet you're already
asking about the Case Room.

146
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,560
Overly ambitious.

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,960
As the saying goes,

148
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,680
high goals lead to intermediate success,

149
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
whereas ordinary goals
only result in mediocrity.

150
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,840
I only wish to set lofty aspirations

151
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,040
to constantly motivate myself
to strive forward.

152
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,340
Only medical officers
and first-class medical attendants

153
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,800
are allowed to enter the Case Room.

154
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,760
To become a first-class medical attendant,

155
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
one must first become
a second-class medical attendant

156
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,320
and rank in the top three
in every assessment.

157
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,720
After six full years,

158
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,160
the person may become

159
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
a first-class attendant
with a physician's recommendation.

160
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,840
Among the new medical attendants
every year,

161
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,840
if one becomes
a first-class medical attendant,

162
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,560
that would be a great fortune.

163
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,000
Thanks for your guidance.

164
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,920
I will certainly strive to become

165
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,760
a first-class medical attendant.

166
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,600
Okay.

167
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,760
I'll be waiting for that day.

168
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,120
(The position of first-class attendant
belongs to me.)

169
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,880
(How dare a nobody like you
compete with me?)

170
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,190
Alright.

171
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,320
That's all for today's matters.

172
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,880
Tomorrow, we will arrange specific tasks.

173
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,240
Thank you, Lord Feng.

174
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,560
Lord Wu.

175
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,410
I'm so nervous.

176
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,800
Zelan.

177
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,320
Thank you for helping me out.

178
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,080
I didn't know you were so capable.

179
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,520
Who taught you all the medical knowledge?

180
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,000
Zelan, look.

181
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,080
This herb is Armand Clematis Stem,

182
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,240
cold in nature and extremely bitter.

183
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,480
Have you ever tasted it?

184
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,440
Kids need to be careful
with the things they eat.

185
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,920
This is Bupleurum.

186
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,560
Its root has

187
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,400
small thorns.

188
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
You must be careful when holding it.

189
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,360
Don't study medicine! It could kill you!

190
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,280
- No, it could kill you!
- Aunt!

191
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,890
Aunt, stop!

192
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,920
You can't study medicine!

193
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
- It could kill you!
- Aunt!

194
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,080
You can't!

195
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,020
- I won't die.
- You'll lose your life...

196
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,760
- I'll protect you.
- It could kill you.

197
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,320
You can't learn it.

198
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,440
Aunt, I'll be fine.

199
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,840
Our family has a private school

200
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,280
and many elders
with deep knowledge in medicine.

201
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,810
Oh,

202
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,800
I see.

203
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,000
(If I don't check the records until)

204
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,440
(I become a first-class attendant,)

205
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,040
(it'll be way too late.)

206
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,520
(I must find a way to sneak into
the Case Room to see it.)

207
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,640
Zelan,

208
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,040
is there something on your mind?

209
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,720
Su Ye,

210
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,240
do you know where the Case Room is?

211
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,920
I don't know either.

212
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
The Case Room isn't for
third-class medical attendants

213
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,440
like us.

214
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,600
I'm just curious.

215
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,040
Let's go.

216
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,520
Attendant Rong,

217
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,200
I know where the Case Room is.

218
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,720
Walk straight along this corridor,

219
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,170
turn right at the end,

220
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,080
and you will see a large red house.

221
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,400
That's the Case Room.

222
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,520
Thank you, Attendant Feng.

223
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,520
You're welcome.

224
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,160
Let's go.

225
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,680
Attendant Feng,

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
isn't the Case Room this way?

227
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,160
Is it?

228
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,560
Maybe I remembered it wrong.

229
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
(Only first-class medical attendants
and medical officers)

230
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
(are allowed to enter.)

231
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,280
(I need to find a way
to disguise myself.)

232
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,480
My Lord.

233
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,440
Are you going to the Laundry Room?

234
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,840
I happen to be going there.

235
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,120
Why don't you let me deliver it for you?

236
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,560
This...

237
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,640
Alright then. Thank you.

238
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,920
Go straight, turn right at the end,

239
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,520
and there's a large red house.

240
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,880
This should be the place.

241
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
(Why is)

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,640
(the Case Room so damp?)

243
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,440
(Why is it the Men's Bathhouse?)

244
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,000
Since you're here,

245
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,200
help me scrub my back.

246
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,880
Let's go.

247
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,800
Who are you?

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,840
I...

249
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,640
I'm a new medical officer here,

250
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,840
and I accidentally
came to the wrong place.

251
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,040
New medical officer?

252
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,240
You have smooth skin,

253
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,120
a bird-like voice,

254
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,480
and no Adam's apple.

255
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,280
When did we

256
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,440
recruit a female officer?
