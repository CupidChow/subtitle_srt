-Kim Hyeongseo-

5
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,760
Oh my god!

6
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:16,060
-Hopeless-

7
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,360
-Sir! Sir! Stop! -Are you crazy?

8
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,390
Sir, stop that please!

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,530
-Don't be smug! -Yeon-gyu's mom is here.

10
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,800
His mom.

11
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,740
We just need to tell them that we live together.

12
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,040
Mom,

13
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,260
I can solve it by myself.

14
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,000
That's all right.

15
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,800
-But if your father knows it... -He is not my father.

16
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,420
There's not much time left before the general election.

17

-Acquisition of Dutch citizenship-

18
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,290
Compared to previous elections, register candidates...

Sir.

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,030
What?

21
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,400
Nothing.

22
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,240
Hey, answer the phone when it's ringing. Don't be lazy.

23
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,540
-Pros and cons of acquiring the Dutch citizenship -
Hey, answer the phone when it's ringing. Don't be lazy.

24
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:44,810
Hey, answer the phone when it's ringing. Don't be lazy.

25
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,450
Are you seeing those foreign pictures again? The Dutch ones?

26
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,320
Hi.

27
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,020

Acquiring Dutch citizenship through "naturalization" is not as easy as in other European countries-

Acquiring Dutch citizenship through "naturalization" is not as easy as in other European countries-

29
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,760
OK. I know it.

30
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,420
I will deliver it to you.

31
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,230
This man always orders only one bowl at a time.

37
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,140
What are you waiting for? Go deliver it!

38
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,180
Seems delicious.

39
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,680
Can't you not eat it?

40
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,520
My kid loves the noodles of this restaurant.

41
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,200
Son, today is your birthday. What do you want?

42
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,510
Dad will buy you a gift the next year.

43
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,240
Go to finish your homework. Put this on the table.

44
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,580
Dad is going to work.

45
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,020
Hey.

46
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
Aren't you busy?

47
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,080
Wait.

48
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,800
Is this for me?

49
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,850
Hyun-woo.

50
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,860
They are daddy's friends.

51
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,760
We have some important things to talk.

52
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,930
Can you stay outside for a moment?

53
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,430
Hyun-woo.

54
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,760
Go out!

55
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,530
-Go out! -Hyun-woo, I'm all right.

56
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,130
Stop. Stop.

57
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,270
-Go out! Don't touch my dad! -Hyun-woo, don't.

58
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,400
-Let's go out. -Ahh.

59
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,540
Let me go.

60
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,610
Hyun-woo.

61
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,250
So how much do you need?

62
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,580
Three hundred won.

63
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,520
That's a large amount for a such young age.

64
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,660
You know that you don't earn much. Ask your father for some money.

65
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,860
When you were busy...I helped.

66
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,570
It's me. It's difficult for me to give you such a large amount.

67
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,470
I really need this money. I will work a hundred times harder.

68
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,240
Why can't you figure out what I mean?

69
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,480
Just go ask your father..

70
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,980
I can't turn to that jerk.

71
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,120
It's OK. It's OK.

72
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,320
Nothing goes wrong here.

73
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,090
Enjoy your lunch.

74
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,190
You cannot tell that jerk.

75
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,860
Please help me.

76
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,300
Sorry for that.

77
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,380
I ran out of my cigarettes.

78
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,410
Give me a lighter.

79
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,510
I'm sick of all this.

80
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,180
You cannot go back to your home, right?

81
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,090
You came several times.

82
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:22,990
Where?

83
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,560
Didn't you drop by our office a few times when delivering?

84
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,230
When did you move here?

85
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,140
Since when I'm born.

86
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,410
-What do we do? -Catch him. Catch him.

87
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,540
Come here. Come here.

88
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,780
-Wait. -Come here.

89
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,940
Catch him. Catch him.

90
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,580
Don't move. Fuck.

91
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,450
Don't move.

92
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,920
Wait.

93
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,890
Wow, isn't that funny?

94
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,160
Do you have any feeling now?

95
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,460
Seems like this son of a bitch took a tumble.

96
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,900
Want to do it again?

97
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,300
Yeon-gyu, hi.

98
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,240
I'm Seong-hun.

99
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,210
You're finished now.

100
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,150
I'm Myeong-hun's elder brother.

101
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,650
This must hurt.

102
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,820
So why did you hit a classmate with something like that?

103
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,790
Myeong-hun bad mouthed my mom. He started it.

104
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,730
Is that true?

105
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,360
Of course not.

106
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,770
He denied.

107
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:14,940
Yeon-gyu,

108
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,970
have you tried to get the money?

109
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,380
It's just three hundred won. Is it hard for you?

110
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,350
We have waited for so long.

111
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,880
Fuck.

112
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,680
Why do you mother and you
both act like this?

113
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,620
You are not beggars.

114
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,590
Do you want me to call somebody for money?

115
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,820
Ask your father.

116
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,230
No. Maybe you should call him uncle?

117
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,470
Don't be arrogant.

118
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,510
Go to hell. Fuck.

119
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,470
Dinner is ready.

120
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,420
Dad hasn't come back.

121
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,970
Hey, Yeon-gyu.

122
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,610
Are you going to work?

123
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,610
Just now Myeong-hun saw me and just turned and left.

124
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,550
Seems like he grew up after being beaten up.

125
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,590
When will you come back to school?

126
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,370
I'm sick of it. This is crazy.

127
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,370
These bastards.

128
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,670
They come once a month as if it's a regular event,

129
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,270
and they always take away my delivery motor!

130
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,200
Fuck. Why is it?

131
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Is it a monthly motor?

132
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,680
-Monly motor. -Yeon-gyu.

133
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,480
Go to deliver this.

134
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,860
Is this funny?

135
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,330
Give me a ride.

136
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,200
Brother.

137
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,230
Why am I your brother? You crazy woman.

138
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,700
Why are you always disturbing me? I'm tired of it.

139
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,740
Don't be rude. Nonsense.

140
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,340
So don't pretend to be familiar with me.

141
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,710
You silly woman.

142
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,240
Go away.

143
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,710
You should go away. Fuck.

144
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,110
What are you doing?

145
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,440
Thinking about helping you.

146
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,180
Tell me, do you want me to help?

147
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,920
Three million won.

148
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,720
This is what my boss offered.

149
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,260
Don't try to look for us.

150
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,690
The problem is solved, right?

151
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,890
There's no need to find the source of the money.

152
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,760
School...I can go to school again.

153
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,830
It is really from a friend I knew on the streets.

154
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,270
Are you afraid that I stole the money?

155
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:30,740
Yes.

156
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,610
I have to go to work.

157
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,660
What did you do?

158
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,130
A boy called me, and said he is your friend.

159
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,830
His name is Myeong-hun.

160
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,710
A guy who is at my son's age
said I didn't nurture you well.

161
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,570
I have no face to live on.

162
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,110
How can I rip this open?

163
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:20,980
Yeon-gyu.

164
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,440
Are you pretending to sleep?

165
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,150
Dad did that because his business doesn't go well, and he is too tired.

166
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,660
I will persuade him to not to hit you again.

167
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,550
You

168
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,820
are his daughter.

169
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,490
No.

170
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,770
I thought about it.

171
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,890
I don't think it works.

172
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,150
There are many other jobs. Maybe you can find one somewhere else.

173
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,520
No. I have to save money.

174
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,800
Don't do that.

175
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,010
You are bleeding.

176
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,550
The guests cannot

177
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,570
tolerate your look.

178
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,000
They are scared.  I have to do this.

179
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,030
Wipe off the blood before you go.

180
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,110
Tissues are over there.

181
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,600
I need to work.

182
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,290
Wipe off the blood before you leave.

183
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,860
-Office Worker Loan-

184
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,140
-One-to-one Service with Daily Payment-

185
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,170
-Office Worker Loan-

186
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,840
-Full Loan with No Need for Guarantee-

187
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,080
Damn it. You scared me!
-Full Loan with No Need for Guarantee-

188
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,020
Damn it. You scared me!

189
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,310
Hurry and go.

190
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,000
Are your ears just for decoration?

191
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,850
Come in.

192
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,100
You are so young. Why are you here?

193
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,090
Didn't Seung-mu tell you not to come here?

194
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:14,890
What?

195
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,730
Wanna pay interest to me?

196
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,890
That money was given to you.
No need to pay it back.

197
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,620
Go home and focus on your study.

198
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,310
Please let me make money.

199
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,460
No.

200
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,160
Go home.

201
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,890
Take your cap off.

202
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,050
Hurry up.

203
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,510
Such a poor thing.

204
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,010
You need the key to start it.

205
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,290
Right?

206
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,060
For old motorbikes,

207
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,300
you just need to do this.

208
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,580
Easy, right?

209
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,590
There.

210
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,690
The date for the last operation.

211
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,340
23rd of June.

212
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,300
What day is it today?

213
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,370
21st of September.

214
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,940
What have I told you?

215
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,200
I told you to look for the ones over 5 months.

216
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,250
Yeah, right.

217
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,820
5 months.

218
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,030
Yeah, right.

219
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,750
5 strokes.

220
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,900
Hey, something over there.

221
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,660
Let's continue the work.

222
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,460
Damn! That was scary!

223
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,960
The damn dog!

224
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,580
What?

225
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,140
Do you wanna lose the payment today?

226
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,900
I've used up my energy. You'll drive.

227
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,210
I saw just now there was another one.

228
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,600
Then use what you've learned.

229
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,730
Don't stare at me, brat!

230
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,160
What's all this about?

231
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,460
What are we here for?

232
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,570
For work.

233
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,350
For theft.

234
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,910
Be careful.

235
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,080
It's gonna be fun if you get caught.

236
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,220
It's all good to go.

237
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,040
Good to go.

238
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,430
Okay, I see.

239
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,690
Okay.

240
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,610
-Unload it. -Okay, bro.

241
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,210
One more.

242
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,320
Okay.

243
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,460
Unload it.

244
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,160
Okay.

245
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,400
Hey you!

246
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,860
Get yourself busy.

247
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,520
Don't just stand there like a fool. Damn.

248
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,640
Be passionate!

249
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,230
Passion! Pa...

250
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,710
ssion!

251
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,180
You brat!

252
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,650
Go to work!

253
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,470
Hurry.

254
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,020
Big brother's here.

255
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,060
Just keep doing it.

256
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,820
I'll pay for part of it.

257
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,230
Don't worry.

258
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,040
You just need to win the election.

259
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,390
But it's not my call.

260
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,880
So...

261
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,670
you won't do it?

262
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,460
Just do whatever you like.

263
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,500
Yes, I'll do it.

264
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,880
I've worked everything out this time.
Re-election won't happen.

265
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,990
Without that guy, it's cast in stone.

266
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,230
What are you worried about?

267
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,890
You brat.

268
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,450
You're too nervous in
preparations for the election, right?

269
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,790
No.

270
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,800
Hey, be a man! Since you've made the decision,

271
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,610
just stick to it!

272
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,640
Jeong Ui-seok!

273
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,830
Yeah!

274
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,860
Jeong Ui-seok!

275
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,330
Yeah!

276
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,540
Get in the car.

277
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,960
Watch your step, brother.

278
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,270
Chi-geon.

279
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,380
Get a bottle of Bacchus

280
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,480
and deliver it to him.

281
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,190
Okay.

282
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,290
Before the end of the election, we'll

283
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,080
use your office temporarily.

284
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,450
It's a good place here. Very remote.

285
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,480
Okay, please make yourself at home.

286
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,810
But you've

287
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,430
done an excellent job here.

288
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,790
Given 3 or 4 more years, you can catch up with them.

289
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,060
It's still a long way to go.

290
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,830
They're having a hard time recently.

291
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,080
Go to work.

292
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,490
Goodbye, big brother!

293
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,280
-Watch your steps, brother! -Watch your steps!

294
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,040
-Bacchus-

295
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,540
Are you okay?

296
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,150
Dad

297
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,650
will give you some money to use.

298
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:16,960
You...

299
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,910
Don't do that job anymore...

300
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,760
Concentrate on your studies from now on.

301
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,170
When?

302
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,510
What?

303
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,390
Uncle, when did you give me money?

304
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,860
Dad.

305
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,600
I'm working hard now.

306
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,010
Take it.

307
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,020
Take it.

308
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,100
Take it, Yeon-gyu.

309
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:04,860
Dad

310
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,330
will stop drinking.

311
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,060
Did you eat?

312
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,730
Get what you want from the fridge.

313
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,650
I don't drink.

314
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,580
That's someone else's.

315
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,310
Drink it.

316
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,530
Why hide it if you're gonna get a scar anyway?

317
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,600
I can teach you.

318
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,150
My mom said she woke up the next day and my dad was gone.

319
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,350
It was the day before I was born.

320
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,210
I thought everyone didn't have a father.

321
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,470
My mom always said the same thing.

322
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,190
It's the same with or without a dad.

323
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,510
I also think so.

324
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,980
But when I was in middle school,

325
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,310
That son of a bitch who owns the supermarket

326
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,100
in my mom's neighborhood.

327
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,870
He knew my mom didn't have a husband, so he came to our home.

328
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,780
I can do nothing.

329
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,580
I was in my room,

330
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,310
I can't move my body.

331
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,370
And then not long after that, I came home.

332
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,660
The uncle, who was meeting with my mom regularly at the time,

333
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,490
sat there like he was in his own home.

334
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,100
With Kim Ha-yan.

335
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,030
He said he declared his marriage.

336
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,440
We will live together.

337
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,880
I was happy at first.

338
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,310
Because there are more people in the house.

339
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,860
He treats mom well.

340
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,060
And he likes to accommodate us.

341
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,390
And put seaweed on our rice for us to eat.

342
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,160
You said you were born and raised in this neighborhood, right?

343
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,060
What?

344
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,950
I've never left here.

345
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,400
This neighborhood's over.

346
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,710
Then and now.

347
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,560
Messed up.

348
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,630
What about the daughter?

349
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,740
Kim Ha-yan.

350
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,540
Why did you help her? You're not even related to her.

351
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,270
Cause we live together.

352
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,790
With her.

353
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,770
I'll...

354
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,780
get hit less.

355
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,960
What are you going to do with the money you make?

356
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,320
Money can't help then.

357
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,590
I want to go somewhere with my mom.

358
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,790
Is there good？

359
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,280
I hear everyone's

360
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,520
pretty much the same there.

361
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,100
There's no such place.

362
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,690
I'd be there if there was.

363
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,300
Fuck.

364
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,130
But.

365
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,860
Why did you give me that money? Three million won.

366
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,860
I think you don't know me.

367
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,510
How come I don't know you?

368
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,320
You can leave later,

369
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,540
or sleep over.

370
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,510
Thank you.

371
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,200
-Come back. -Yes.

372
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,250
Don't dawdle. Send it over.

373
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,630
What are you doing here?

374
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,470
Are you here to pay for this glass?

375
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,620
It's a new job.

376
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,040
Because someone fired me.

377
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,910
In that case, you should pick me a new one.

378
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,100
It's exactly the same as before.

379
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,570
This one is in good condition.

380
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,180
Hey.

381
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,910
I just need the money for the motorcycle loan.

382
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,550
I don't need anything else.

383
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,550
We need a loan of at least 3 million won.

384
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,060
You can use the extra money to keep the restaurant running.

385
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,200
Which asshole, shit.

386
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,260
Another cost.

387
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,530
Okay, I got it. Three hundred.

388
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,510
How can we live like this?

389
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,420
Looks like you're getting better after a few beatings.

390
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,260
Did you get it?

391
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,590
I won't do it anymore.

392
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,090
I've gotten a lot of texts because of you.

393
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,600
Ask me why I took the money and didn't deliver the goods.

394
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,600
Then go through the trash and mail it yourself.

395
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,530
Bitch, did I say I'd do it?

396
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,040
You said you'd pick it up in time for me to sell it for you.

397
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,410
You said you need money.

398
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,770
Fuck.

399
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,450
Myung-ann High School, Bamboo Grove.
It seems like some pervert has been rummaging through
the girls' restroom trash cans lately.
The second and third floors are in such a mess. it's crazy--

400
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,950
You're on your own with this kind of thing.

401
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,980
You don't want money?

402
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:49,590
-Listening Pass
Kim HA-yan
Myung-ann Cram School-

403
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,190
I've got enough.

404
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,020
Fuck.

405
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,260
Fuck.

406
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,190
Listen.

407
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,030
If you don't want to die, bring me the stuff anyway.

408
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,020
I did so.

409
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,180
You.

410
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,050
Here.

411
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,890
You're a pervert who goes through garbage cans.

412
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,190
If you touch Kim Yeon-kyu again, I'll send these out.

413
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,060
Think about it.

414
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,330
Bitch.

415
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,370
I'm Seong-hun.

416
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,970
Get that woman's cell phone by the end of the day.

417
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,170
If you don't wanna die.

418
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,180
What's the relationship between you two?

419
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,710
Do you have something?

420
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,220
What are you doing?

421
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,560
Hey, Kim Ha-yan.

422
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,230
Fuck, who let you do this?

423
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,760
I can't take any more of that asshole's shit. Why?

424
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,030
You're afraid I'll go behind your back?

425
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,370
Give it to me.

426
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,550
It's your first time, but it's a lot of work.

427
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,790
You've been doing well lately, Yeon-gyu.

428
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,120
165.

429
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,230
What?

430
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,400
That's mine.

431
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,110
It's expensive.

432
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,220
-The election bureau of Myung-ann City,
Lee Hyun-nam has unexpectedly run for the election for three times,
and the opposition party's reserve candidate is in turmoil.

433
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,050
Lee Hyun-nam has changed his tune.
-The election bureau of Myung-ann City,
Lee Hyun-nam has unexpectedly run for the election for three times,

434
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:03,950
Lee Hyun-nam has changed his tune.

435
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,720
That old man, Kim Gook-hwan, made this happen.

436
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,370
You guys go figure out how to take care of him.

437
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,010
Lunch is from 12:00 to 1:30.

438
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,950
Otherwise, it's just off hours.

439
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,180
Then it will be easy.

440
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:37,320
When the shift ends, all of Lee Hyun-nam's staff will be gone.

441
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,590
I just asked.

442
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,130
He'll take a cab in order

443
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:46,530
to be a clean public servant.

444
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,070
When he gets in the car, I'm gonna kick his ass.

445
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,270
See if he's listening.

446
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,840
The problem is, after we called Lee Hyun-nam over.

447
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,810
If we have to gag him.

448
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,420
He has a son.

449
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,650
His son..

450
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,290
How about photos?

451
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,990
Hey, kid, the big brother's talking.

452
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,300
Do you know PS?

453
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,070
What?

454
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,840
Photos.

455
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,110
What kind of photos?

456
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,510
Like weird photos...

457
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,680
Sniffing girls' underwear...

458
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,420
In that case, we don't have to do anything to him.

459
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,450
No one will be hurt.

460
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:50,860
-Cab Operator's License Jeon Kook-jin -

461
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,560
-Cab Operator's License Cho Won-gu-

462
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,040
Why are you like this?

463
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,440
You haven't been discharged yet?

464
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,480
Did you know what it was about?

465
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,610
Yes.

466
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,350
What's the status of his debt now?

467
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:45,880
The principal is 7 million won.

468
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,250
The interest is 66.31 million won.

469
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:51,590
A total of 73.31 million won.

470
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,420
It's still being paid off, isn't it?

471
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,620
And the game.

472
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,760
Bastard.

473
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,860
-Shut up! -Seung-mu.

474
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:08,240
But your interest keeps rolling in.

475
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:11,970
If you do a good job,

476
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,010
I'll waive some of the interest.

477
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,080
Okay?

478
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,220
So how much is the interest forgiven?

479
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,830
Let's cut you 80%.

480
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,750
You listen in the trunk.

481
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:53,820
If there's anything wrong.

482
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,520
Call me, okay?

483
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:08,100
You...

484
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,870
You are Lee Hyun-nam right?

485
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,470
I heard you're running for office this time.

486
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:16,670
Yes.

487
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,540
Thank you in advance.

488
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,740
Because while you were here, the subway was opened.

489
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,250
A lot of cabbies got mad.

490
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,720
But my son rides that subway.

491
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,390
Said it was more comfortable than the bus.

492
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,660
How old is your son?

493
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,830
He's in second grade this year.

494
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,660
Well, that's a good way to get on this.

495
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,330
But not now.

496
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,400
The kid got hurt a while back.

497
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,300
Well...

498
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,740
What's wrong?

499
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,340
Is it serious?

500
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,540
It was just a head injury at first.

501
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:54,640
He can still talk when I'm in good spirits.

502
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,450
But at some point, he couldn't even open his eyes.

503
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,120
How come?

504
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,160
Councillor.

505
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,560
You know those guys up at our neighborhood motorcycle store.

506
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,300
Please arrest them.

507
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,070
What's wrong with them?

508
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:22,400
They

509
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,910
beat up my son.

510
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:25,510
-Seong-mu-
beat up my son.

511
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,340
What's wrong with my son? They beat him up like that.
-Seong-mu-

512
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:28,740
What's wrong with my son? They beat him up like that.

513
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,350
If you need anything, just come at me.

514
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:34,050
Why did they beat my son?

515
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,950
Uncle, stop there.

516
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,090
Stop.

517
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,290
Why?

518
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:49,870
The cops are friends with the gang, too.

519
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,500
They call each other brothers.

520
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,200
These guys are a disgrace to the civil service. Fuck.

521
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,570
Turn around. Go to the police.

522
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,140
-What is he doing? -Seong-mu.

523
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:07,920
See it.

524
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:11,120
What are you?

525
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,930
Asshole.

526
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,700
-Asshole. -No.

527
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,010
Fuck.

528
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,880
What are you doing?

529
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,230
Wipe away your tears.

530
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,390
Uncle.

531
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,100
Quick.

532
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:10,710
Go check it.

533
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,310
I told you to call, but you didn't.

534
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,150
The battery's dead.

535
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:21,260
Lee Hyun-nam can see something's wrong.

536
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:22,990
In an emergency I went straight to it.

537
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,230
Sorry.

538
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,730
Buy something for the kids

539
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,160
to eat when you leave.

540
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,940
You don't know.

541
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,840
Do you know what my kid looks like now?

542
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,950
You said you'd reduce the interest rate, and you're going to do it.

543
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,570
Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.

544
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,200
It's time to pay this month.

545
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,920
Are you bold now?

546
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:13,740
As planed.

547
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,070
Let's go see the old man first.

548
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:18,440
OK, got it.

549
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,480
Tomorrow you will go.

550
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:31,590
What?

551
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:38,690
Ah...

552
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,300
Boss asked me to show you this.

553
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:19,200
Your boss is really something else, isn't he?

554
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,480
-Bring me the one on the table. - Yes, sir.

555
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,660
I'm doing this.

556
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,930
Work hard.

557
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:20,500
You'll be treated well.

558
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,460
What?

559
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:26,670
Consider yesterday's per diem

560
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:28,640
as money for your last surgery.

561
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,610
You want more?

562
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:36,910
What?

563
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,590
You can do whatever you want with your allowance.

564
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:47,920
We'll go first.

565
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,460
What's just now?

566
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:52,860
Nothing.

567
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,400
Thank you, big brother.

568
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,340
Come here.

569
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:13,550
Not big brother, call me brother.

570
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:17,250
Brother.

571
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,020
This is home.

572
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,590
You are good for here.

573
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,600
Go.

574
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:37,870
What?

575
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,540
Anything?

576
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,110
Can I

577
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,720
ask you something.

578
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,020
Say it.

579
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,720
Nothing.

580
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,700
You want my help?

581
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,770
I can't get involved in your family's business.

582
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,370
He's your father. You'll have to deal with it yourself.

583
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:10,370
Not him.

584
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,180
Fuck, what does this guy want?

585
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,550
But.

586
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,330
Fuck, what's wrong with him?

587
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:08,030
Don't get too much.

588
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,770
Like Americans who only know how to eat burgers.

589
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,130
Then don't eat it.

590
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,080
What?

591
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:00,920
What.

592
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,880
I'm not waiting for you.

593
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:11,590
Those people won't bother you again.

594
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:14,830
So, from tomorrow.

595
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,470
Go to school.

596
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:23,940
What are you wearing?

597
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,810
Like some maniac.

598
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,580
I am, what.

599
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:28,980
Get inside.

600
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,080
I'm not going.

601
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,010
It's going crazy in there again.

602
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:41,090
Get inside first.

603
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:27,080
Take it.

604
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:27,710
OK.

605
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:29,680
Closer.

606
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,370
OK.

607
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:32,600
Take it.

608
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,370
OK.

609
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,450
Hey.

610
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:40,140
-No. 2-

611
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,770
Be careful when you put it in.
-No. 2-

612
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:42,020
-No. 2-

613
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,530
I can't do it even if I die.
-No. 2-

614
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:43,600
I can't do it even if I die.

615
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,340
Why not?

616
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,570
Watch it.

617
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:48,910
What's wrong?

618
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,870
Well.

619
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:52,200
-No. 2 Jeong Ui-seok-
Well.

620
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:52,570
-No. 2 Jeong Ui-seok-

621
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:59,850
Ask me to die?

622
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:01,620
So,

623
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:06,110
why would you tear the money?

624
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,050
I've helped you reduce the interest.

625
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:12,910
You'll be able to take a breath next month.

626
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,970
Go to hell?

627
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,940
Help me go to hell?

628
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,620
Just go to hell?

629
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:27,110
Just go to hell?

630
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:36,340
Let go, let go.

631
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,420
Are you crazy?

632
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:45,820
Oh!

633
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,080
Fuck!

634
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:51,970
Let me go, let me go.

635
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,600
Let me go!

636
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,600
Today's meal is not so bad.

637
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:16,020
Madwoman!

638
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:17,880
Lunatic!

639
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,570
Now you don't even say hello to me?

640
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:05,480
Kim Ha-yan.

641
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:08,420
I can't make much money.

642
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,250
I just drink every day.

643
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,250
You think I'm funny, don't you?

644
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,820
Tell me!

645
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:22,510
Does your dad

646
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,570
look like an idiot?

647
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,900
Eat them, quick!

648
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:36,400
Didn't I say I'd quit drinking?

649
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,220
Answer me, bitch!

650
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,340
Are you crazy?

651
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,110
My daughter actually said I was crazy.

652
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,880
Yeon-gyu, you heard it!

653
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:56,020
As her brother, you showed off everyday and everywhere.

654
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,650
She learned these from you.

655
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:01,170
Go out!

656
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:07,310
Why don't you bring back a sixth stepmother?

657
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,910
How long do I have to do this?

658
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:19,020
Yeon-gyu, you guy!

659
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,540
I'm not done yet! Where are you going?

660
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:24,200
Let down!

661
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:27,340
If you don't want to see me die in front of you.

662
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:45,570
Brother.

663
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,080
Who are you?

664
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:58,540
Fuck, who are you?

665
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:54,620
Why are you standing there?

666
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,220
Sit down.

667
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:08,710
What are you going to do now?

668
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:09,650
What?

669
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,820
So why make a fuss over nothing?

670
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:21,250
Is this the time for you to be conscientious

671
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:24,570
and brave?

672
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:28,340
Sorry.

673
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:35,200
Why didn't you tell me first?

674
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,820
Not anymore.

675
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,170
Don't move.

676
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,000
Don't move.

677
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,710
In a minute.

678
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:01,420
Sorry, brother.

679
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,680
I have to do this.

680
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,170
Sorry, brother.

681
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:33,510
Brother, don't you feel sorry for that people?

682
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:18,740
Come back after restoration.

683
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,710
Or you go help her and take care of the aftermath.

684
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:34,000
Stand up.

685
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:36,910
Kim Ha-yan.

686
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:57,600
Sorry.

687
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:01,450
So light! That's all.

688
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:02,170
Em?

689
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:04,080
It's light. I don't care.

690
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,770
Boss, let's give another five thousand!

691
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,480
Hey!

692
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,170
What's wrong?

693
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:45,000
What are you doing?

694
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:48,420
Hey! Hey!

695
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:03,940
It's so old!

696
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,250
Does the car still work?

697
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:10,250
No one will buy this stuff.

698
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,280
Find a place to put it.

699
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:14,820
I'll take it to the scrap heap.

700
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:21,050
Then why should I bring it back?

701
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,510
No why.

702
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,740
We'll do what we need to do.

703
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,740
So why?

704
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,850
Sucks, huh?

705
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,850
Yeon-gyu.

706
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,110
If you go back, that home is your future.

707
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:52,110
Take a favorite back.

708
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,250
Don't have dreams.

709
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:03,880
Pay back the money.

710
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,800
What?

711
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,450
Em.

712
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,510
Fuck.

713
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,850
Fuck! Let go!

714
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:14,080
Let me go!

715
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,940
I'll give you the money.

716
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:48,050
The team leader hasn't had a drink yet!

717
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:49,740
Are you crazy? You nasty guy!

718
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,310
What are you doing?

719
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,220
He is the youngest man of Chi-geon.

720
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,650
Leave him alone.

721
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:02,850
Just eat.

722
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,820
You also eat.

723
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,650
Everyone, fill up your drinks.

724
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:12,050
Let's drink.

725
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:13,600
Drink!

726
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:27,020
Eat more.

727
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,800
Uncle, you have a drink too.

728
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,200
I wish you well!

729
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:43,910
It's been a long time since I've seen your father.

730
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:45,110
I'd like to make a toast to him.

731
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:47,280
Did I do something wrong?

732
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:48,710
What are you doing?

733
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:49,340
Yeah.

734
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:56,170
Let me have a toast, brother.

735
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:04,600
You don't drink, so leave your uncle

736
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,880
alone.

737
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,600
Every family has a skeleton in the cupboard.

738
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:16,970
You mother is old.

739
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:20,450
I've paid for your education, taught you how to do things,

740
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:22,400
and paid for you for years.

741
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,540
Now it's time for you to help me.

742
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:30,020
We didn't get the redevelopment project this time,

743
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,280
but that's over.

744
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:38,480
What are you sighing for? You nasty guy!

745
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:40,200
Didn't you want to be a congressman?

746
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,000
What kind of hair is this?

747
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,740
Let's get your hair done first!

748
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:44,880
Go!

749
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,540
The youngest.

750
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,910
How old are you?

751
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,540
Eighteen.

752
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,000
Brother.

753
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,020
He's still young, so he doesn't really know the rules.

754
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:29,940
Yeah.

755
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,200
Big Brother wants to ask someone to do something.

756
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:48,420
Yeah.

757
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,900
-Gyeonggi  Myung-ann MA6501-

758
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,600
How old are you?

759
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,650
Twenty four years old.

760
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:21,570
Okay.

761
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:25,400
You have a drink too.

762
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,280
Yeah.

763
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,340
When they beg for you,

764
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,220
the grown-ups will do it all the time,

765
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:36,480
so you can be obedient.

766
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,050
Why are you doing these?

767
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:45,050
Have you been here before?

768
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,450
I came here a few times as a kid.

769
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:51,170
It sucks here.

770
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:55,000
It's similar to your home.

771
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:02,400
There was an old man who used to come here,

772
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:05,480
with his son.

773
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:16,420
He threw his son into the middle of the river

774
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:20,370
and sat out there by himself,

775
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,510
drinking wine,

776
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:25,880
waiting for his son to come back from catching fish.

777
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,400
One day,

778
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,250
his son did not return after went into the water,

779
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:35,710
for his son got his foot entangled in the fishing net he had brought in

780
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:37,970
and died.

781
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:45,110
There's a fishing guy who comes here all the time, too.

782
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,820
That day,

783
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:50,140
thinking it would take two hours,

784
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:52,280
he hung up some random bait and waited for the fish to bite.

785
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,910
After about five minutes,

786
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,420
and it wasn't long after that,

787
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:02,000
a strong guy bit the hook.

788
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,420
"I'm going to catch the big one today."

789
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,530
He was so excited that he desperately tried to reel in his rod.

790
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:14,730
However,

791
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:21,430
The fish he caught was only so small.

792
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:27,500
So speechless.

793
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,630
But he wanted a closer look,

794
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:32,200
so he padded over to have a look.

795
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:34,760
He was startled.

796
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:38,130
Because it wasn't a fish,

797
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
it was half of a child's ear.

798
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,930
The kid was dead

799
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:48,530
when the fishing guy caught him.

800
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,030
The child must be dead.

801
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,300
However, he spat and stood up.

802
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:03,340
He prepared some food, turned around

803
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:08,650
and the child was nowhere to be seen.

804
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:17,290
In fact, the kid ran to where the old man had been waiting for a long time

805
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,940
and then asked him,

806
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:24,470
"Daddy,

807
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:29,200
why didn't Daddy save me?

808
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,810
Do you know what the father said at the time?

809
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:36,920
You?

810
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:41,880
Did something happen to you?

811
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:51,570
Fuck!

812
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:04,290
When he was pulled up from the water again,

813
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:07,410
the kid dead.

814
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:13,210
Breathing doesn't necessarily mean one's alive.

815
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,850
You asked me why I did what I did.

816
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:26,040
That's the kind of question only living person would ask.

817
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,120
Where's all that money from?

818
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,330
Take me with you.

819
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:14,290
What have you been up to lately?

820
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:21,280
I'm just doing what I can.

821
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:25,620
What are the things you can do?

822
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:32,780
News just came in,

823
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:36,120
The ruling party's candidate No. 2 Jeong Ui-seok suddenly announced his resignation

824
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:40,470
from his election and from the party the day before the election.

825
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:40,590
-Candidate Jeong Ui-seok suddenly announced his resignation from the election and from the party-
from his election and from the party the day before the election.

826

-Candidate Jeong Ui-seok suddenly announced his resignation from the election and from the party-

827
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,980
Some people speculate that it is the ruling party that ...
-Candidate Jeong Ui-seok suddenly announced his resignation from the election and from the party-

828
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:42,990
-Candidate Jeong Ui-seok suddenly announced his resignation from the election and from the party-

829
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:43,840
Jeong Ui-seok you son of a bitch!
-Candidate Jeong Ui-seok suddenly announced his resignation from the election and from the party-

830
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,270
Jeong Ui-seok you son of a bitch!

831
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,330
Son of a bitch!

832
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:06,970
He wants to keep me by his side and train me.

833
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:11,090
I had to say yes.

834
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:22,660
No other options.

835
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:28,480
-Jeong Ui-seok-

836
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:42,940
Wait!

837
01:23:45,870 --> 01:23:47,620
You are our youngest.

838
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:55,140
Kid, I was gonna talk to him myself.

839
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:12,360
Let me make a call. Please let me make a call.

840
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:17,180
I wanted to give back everything I've got so far.

841
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,100
If he knew, he wouldn't have sent you.

842
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:23,370
Just a phone call, please.

843
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,390
Sir, it's me.

844
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:44,610
It's absolutely not that.

845
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:50,960
I just don't want to do it anymore, that's all, really.

846
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:56,790
Now I just want to get out of here.

847
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:02,300
Good days will come.

848
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,980
Let's talk about everything today then.

849
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:09,800
You like fishing. Let’s go fishing.

850
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:14,480
Thank you, Sir.

851
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,470
Hey, sir.

852
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:46,090
I just received the money.

853
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:58,590
Sir wants me to tell you

854
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:02,920
what you did was like breaking his leg.

855
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,000
It's only fair if the same thing happens to you.

856
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:12,250
I'm sorry. Please understand it.

857
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,620
Otherwise he will cut off my hands.

858
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,750
Still didn't hear from him?

859
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:01,330
Yeah.

860
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:05,580
Get it done tonight.

861
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:07,270
Yeah, got it.

862
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:09,890
Then,

863
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,840
bring me one of his hands.

864
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:16,550
Bro,

865
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:23,470
what is it?

866
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,010
Nothing.

867
01:28:58,180 --> 01:28:59,520
He wants to see you.

868
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:20,020
Fucking shit.

869
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:38,750
-Son-

870
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,050
Wait a moment. Coming!

871
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:47,160
-LIMS Fried Chicken-

872
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:07,150
Mom?

873
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:11,430
Yeon-gyu.

874
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:17,810
Thank you so much.

875
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:26,000
What's going on?

876
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,380
Where are you?

877
01:30:29,950 --> 01:30:30,790
I...

878
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,270
Just come here, Yeon-gyu.

879
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,630
Talk to him yourself.

880
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:43,470
If I go, you will cut off my hand.

881
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:45,580
There's nothing I can do about it.

882
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:52,080
You did it, right? My motorcycle.

883
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:55,430
What are you talking about?

884
01:30:57,670 --> 01:31:01,690
It was you who let them tamper with my motorcycle.

885
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,520
What should I do now?

886
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:31,660
-Chi-geon-

887
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:38,120
No.2

888
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,380
-Kim Yeon-gyu-

889
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:50,210
What is it?

890
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:51,300
Kim Ha-yan,

891
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:56,470
please help me.

892
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:14,020
A few more left.

893
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:15,170
It's the last one!

894
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:26,150
Excuse me,

895
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,350
what's going on here?

896
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:36,690
Why did you sell all those?

897
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:50,260
Who the hell is that child? You just have to do this?

898
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,210
When did you come to this neighborhood?

899
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:57,660
When I was about 20.

900
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:02,380
Why did you suddenly mention our neighborhood?

901
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:07,210
You pushed the child into the water,

902
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,710
there has to be someone who pulled him up.

903
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:18,540
It wasn't me.

904
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:28,900
I really did not do that.

905
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:30,820
Shit!

906
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:45,010
Errand boy.

907
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:31,880
-Sir-

908
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:37,310
Hey, sir.

909
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:40,720
Yeah, our youngest just came back.

910
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,850
What are you doing standing there? Come in and sit down.

911
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:48,440
Didn't you say that if I come here, you will agree to his request?

912
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:02,430
I'll get the money.

913
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:09,670
But before that, please take care of Ha-yan.

914
01:36:18,790 --> 01:36:20,910
I need to get the money.

915
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:22,290
What are you doing?

916
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:25,840
Just give me some time, I'll find a way...

917
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:26,730
Kim Yeon-gyu

918
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:32,440
Give me some time, I can definitely...

919
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:43,160
I asked for this because

920
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:47,120
you would only agree if I do it this way.

921
01:36:47,290 --> 01:36:49,800
This is the only thing I can do.

922
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:56,310
I'll finish it myself.

923
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,070
He said he will bring the money.

924
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:10,270
I got it.

925
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:12,590
Just go.

926
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:20,940
Go.

929
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:26,520
Hey.

930
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,790
Don't you feel bad for Kim Yeon-gyu?

931
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,950
Why is everyone torturing him?

932
01:39:48,410 --> 01:39:49,860
Will you stop the torture

933
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,810
if I stay here and behave?

940
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:28,530

Is everything done?

942
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:23,650
Ha-yan,

943
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:26,660
I'm sorry.

944
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:28,260
What are you apologizing for?

945
01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:30,530
Let's go.

946
01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:32,960
I'm begging you.

947
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:34,730
Everything will be fine.

948
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:37,430
Don't worry.

949
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:50,410

Let me go.

952

Help.

953
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:40,260
Kim Yeon-Gyu

954
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:21,290
That kid is dying anyways.

955
01:48:22,990 --> 01:48:23,990
Drowned.

956
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:48,320
Yeon-gyu.

957
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:11,590
Bring that guy to me in the afternoon.

958
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,020
Feed him with some yukgaejang.

959

965
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:20,780
I'm sorry, Yeon-gyu.

966
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,550
My Ha-yan,

967
01:54:25,420 --> 01:54:26,960
what happened to my Ha-yan?

968
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:33,500
I couldn't find her in this neighborhood.

969
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:37,470
I want to be nice to her.

970
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:46,440
I don't want anything like this.

971
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:50,480
How is Ha-yan?

972
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:53,880
I can't find Ha-yan.
