1
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,093
Straighten your arms.

2
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,055
- One…
- More.

3
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,017
- Three…
- Okay, that's good.

4
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,269
Up… Two, three…

5
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,855
Straighten your arms, girls!

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,108
Lara, chin up.

7
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,569
Axis…

8
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,988
Axis, and then left.

9
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,364
And axis…

10
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,579
Good.

11
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,419
Good! Girls, water break.
Clear your routines.

12
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,756
Higher!

13
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,716
Sunshine, can we take a picture?

14
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,885
Sure!

15
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,345
Smile!

16
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,305
- Smile!
- One more.

17
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,559
- You're so great, Sunshine.
- Thanks! You too.

18
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,771
Be ready please!

19
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,566
Point your toes.

20
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,612
Sunshine, you go first.

21
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,322
- Let's go.
- Yes, Coach!

22
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,741
Let's go, baby, let's go.

23
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,535
You gained weight, Sunshine.

24
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,452
Coach?

25
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,537
I didn't, Coach!

26
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,540
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

27
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,166
You gained four pounds.

28
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,585
I didn't, Coach.

29
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,379
You might be getting complacent.

30
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,881
This is your last shot at the Olympics.
I think you're forgetting--

31
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,133
Not at all, Coach.

32
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,593
I'm ready. Even for
the World Championships next year.

33
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,847
Don't slack off just because
your spot on the national team's secure.

34
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,265
Yes, Coach.

35
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,767
Your Asian Games golds
don't count for much.

36
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,353
It's the Olympics qualifiers
in three months.

37
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,604
Yes, Coach.

38
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,149
All right. Let's see it.

39
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,991
Let's go, baby,

40
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,701
Find my hands.

41
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,206
Okay, that's good.

42
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,543
Just repeat it.

43
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,546
Good.

44
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,601
Sunshine, focus!

45
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,269
Drown out the noise.

46
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,800
Good.

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,094
Smile.

48
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,399
That's my girl!

49
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,696
Very good.

50
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,782
Okay.

51
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,714
Okay.

52
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:18,967
Very good.

53
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,435
Fuck!

54
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,478
Fuck it!

55
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,314
Don't say bad words, dear.

56
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,236
Sunshine, are you okay?

57
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,154
Sunshine--

58
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,532
- Are you all right?
- Sunshine!

59
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,158
Oh my god!

60
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,339
- Sunshine?
- Yes, ma'am.

61
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,674
Are you still dizzy?

62
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,135
Slightly, Ma'am Charm.

63
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,512
What could have caused it?
Didn't you eat?

64
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,515
I did.

65
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,017
Are you on your period?

66
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,268
No.

67
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,478
When was your last menstruation?

68
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,610
When?

69
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,447
I can't remember.

70
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,408
You should know these things.

71
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,243
You're training
for the World Championships.

72
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,288
Give me a moment.
I'll be back, Ma'am Charm.

73
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,206
Sunshine, where are you going?

74
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,125
Good form.

75
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,087
Good.

76
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,925
Are you okay, dear?

77
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,386
Ma'am Charm is sending me home, Coach.

78
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,597
- Goodbye and thank you.
- All right.

79
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,684
- Hi, Sunshine!
- Hey, good luck with practice.

80
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,813
- Hi, Sunshine!
- Hello. Hi, Ma'am!

81
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,901
- Hi, Sunshine!
- Sunshine!

82
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:00,818
Hello.

83
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,051
Here's your receipt, ma'am.
I'll put it all here.

84
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,554
Here's your change, ma'am.

85
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,432
Don't forget, ma'am!

86
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,279
What will you buy, kid?

87
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,614
What?

88
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,410
I need one…

89
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,620
Which medicine?

90
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,830
The…

91
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,666
- Pregnancy test.
- Pregnancy test?

92
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,917
Yes, it's for my friend.

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,335
Okay, give me an ID.

94
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,378
What?

95
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,295
ID!

96
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,256
Why do I need to give an ID?

97
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,632
Oh, dear!

98
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:09,011
Kids these days! Can't hold back.

99
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,721
I'll get this.

100
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,225
There she goes meddling again.

101
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,563
Best to buy two.
Different brands, just to be sure.

102
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,897
How much, ma'am?

103
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,816
$4.

104
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,034
Here.

105
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,035
Thank you.

106
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,505
No.

107
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,593
No.

108
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,715
Fuck, Sunshine.

109
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,091
Fuck.

110
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,734
You pooping in there?
The line's building up out here!

111
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,475
Hello?

112
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,398
No, sir. My friend wants to know--

113
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,275
Not for me, sir. Not me!

114
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,901
No, sir! It's not, it's--

115
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,905
Fuck! Do you want to die?

116
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,823
Yes.

117
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,241
Don't drag me into it!

118
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:36,909
Sorry!

119
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,749
Squeeze in! There's room for ten more!

120
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,586
Make room! Squeeze in!

121
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,341
Here's my fare. Student rate.

122
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,721
Which stop?

123
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,724
Where are you getting off?

124
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,476
Just wherever, sir.

125
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,936
Where?

126
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,647
Wherever the last stop is.

127
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:11,235
CHUG FIVE BOTTLES OF BEER IN A ROW,
TO LOOSEN THE BABY'S GRIP.

128
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:15,114
DON'T EVER BUY FROM QUIAPO,
COULD BE FAKE!

129
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,183
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,645
Sorry, please forgive me.

131
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,191
- Please buy some?
- I have no money.

132
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,984
- Just so I can buy food.
- I don't have money!

133
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,903
Bitch!

134
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,613
Sorry.

135
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,281
I'm really, really sorry.

136
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,741
I'll do everything!

137
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,577
Please take this away, Lord.

138
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,372
If this is a nightmare,
please wake me up.

139
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,749
Sorry.

140
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,960
I'm really sorry.

141
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,838
I'll do everything.
I'll make it up to You, Lord.

142
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,383
I'll make up for everything!
Just take this away.

143
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,476
EXIT

144
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,535
MENSTRUAL STIMULANT

145
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,580
ABORTION IS MURDER

146
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,207
You need something, kid?

147
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,834
- What?
- I have the pills here. How far along?

148
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,919
No.

149
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,465
Cig?

150
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:21,842
20 cents.

151
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:27,932
What the fuck!

152
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,683
Don't say bad words!

153
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,143
Why do you care?
Are you my mother?

154
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,438
Why are you smoking at your age?
That's harmful to the--

155
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,816
Why were you checking out abortifacients?

156
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,152
Murderer!

157
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,448
Murderer!

158
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,575
Murderer!

159
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,868
Murderer!

160
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,286
Murderer!

161
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,621
Murderer!

162
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,914
Murderer!

163
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,833
Murderer!

164
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,001
Murderer!

165
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,026
- Don't take too long.
- I won't be long, but go ahead--

166
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,194
- Sunshine's here.
- What?

167
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,362
There she is.

168
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,538
Hey. I didn't know you're gonna be here.

169
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,581
I mean--

170
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,749
You miss me, huh?

171
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,086
What?

172
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,755
That?

173
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,549
Come on, babe. It's nothing.

174
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,676
- She's just a friend. Okay?
- Miggy--

175
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,220
I'm pregnant.

176
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,138
What?

177
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,724
I'm pregnant.

178
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,644
I said I'm pregnant!

179
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,229
Yeah, I heard you!

180
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,480
Fuck!

181
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,524
Fuck!

182
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,238
Fuck!

183
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,199
Fucking shit!

184
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,371
How are you sure that's mine?

185
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,665
You asshole, that's all you can say?

186
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,296
- What's your plan?
- You mean our plan!

187
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,340
- You got me fucking pregnant!
- Can you fucking calm down?

188
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,674
- No, you calm down.
- Calm down!

189
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,765
You know what to do, right?

190
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,933
- What?
- You know what to do.

191
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,684
- Don't drag me into this.
- Asshole!

192
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,810
Hey!

193
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,853
Fuck you!

194
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,730
You piece of shit!

195
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,582
This is his car, right?

196
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,042
What?

197
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,211
That fucking douche owns this car, right?

198
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,253
Don't say bad words!

199
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,381
You've got a foul mouth for a kid.

200
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,719
Do the honors.

201
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,852
He knocked you up.

202
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,399
And then gaslights you
by saying he's not the father.

203
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,610
Then you run the risk of
being thrown out of the national team

204
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,529
while he gets to go on with his life?

205
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,284
That's it! Over there!
Right in the middle!

206
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,786
Keep going! Harder!

207
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,914
Harder! Push!

208
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,582
Good! Very good!

209
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,460
Fuck you, you piece of shit!

210
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,295
Go!

211
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,673
That's my girl!

212
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,259
He's good for nothing!

213
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,555
- He left you!
- Hey!

214
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,650
Hurry!

215
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,239
Where are we going?

216
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,491
I don't know.

217
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,285
That's tough.

218
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,288
Running around not knowing where to go.

219
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,957
How old are you anyway?
Why are you such a know-it-all?

220
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,543
How old are you?
Why are you a know-nothing?

221
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,878
Are you fucking with me?

222
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,589
Don't say bad words, remember?

223
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,840
Who are you?

224
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,675
I don't know actually.

225
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,802
- I just suddenly--
- Say it politely!

226
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,554
I'm older than you.

227
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,680
I just suddenly…

228
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,517
…appear everywhere, Ma'am.

229
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,570
HOW MUCH?

230
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,405
- What's that? Let me see.
- No!

231
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,948
This is not for kids.

232
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,325
Nosy kid.

233
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,494
- And you're an adult?
- Yes, why?

234
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,370
Be careful with that.

235
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,789
You're on the national team.

236
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,666
You can get exposed.

237
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,168
I'm going home.

238
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,962
- I'll come with!
- No. It's my home, not yours.

239
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,006
You better go home, too.

240
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,424
Here.

241
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,677
Take a trike home.
This should be enough.

242
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,679
You're on your own.

243
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,099
Even if I walk to get there,
I'll go where you're headed!

244
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,184
I don't care!
I'm not your mother.

245
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,478
Annoying!

246
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,953
I'm here.

247
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,413
- Sis.
- Sunshine!

248
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,331
Hey.

249
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,500
Your new floor mats are here!

250
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,669
- This is it?
- Yes, that's it.

251
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,379
It's pretty big.

252
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,965
Hope it's more comfy than the old one.

253
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,301
There, hold on.

254
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,886
I'll attend to your aunt first.

255
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,597
Look at this, Sunshine.

256
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,765
Here.

257
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,517
You sewed it in!

258
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,560
I did!

259
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,811
- I sewed on the sequins!
- It's so pretty!

260
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,729
I put them to the side!

261
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,731
- It's so beautiful!
- Right.

262
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,191
Hold on, baby.

263
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,113
Give me a moment, dear.

264
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,739
<i>Girl, you coming?</i>

265
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,450
<i>Can't seem to catch you! I miss you!</i>

266
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,327
<i>Come, okay?</i>

267
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,953
<i>Let's go, Shine!</i>

268
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,335
This is what I'm saying.

269
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,419
Cute, right?

270
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,129
Okay, just wait.

271
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,756
Guys… Oh, my God.

272
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,341
Is that Sunshine?

273
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,967
Oh, my God.

274
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,677
- Sis?
- Girl…

275
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,639
Sis, it's really you!

276
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,433
- How are you?
- So glad you're here.

277
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,769
- Hello.
- Hi.

278
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,063
- Hi, Gelai.
- What's up with joining us?

279
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,482
- The world is healing.
- Hi, Kara.

280
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,359
Where's Miggy?

281
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,069
Why are you alone?

282
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,278
Did you guys fight?

283
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,822
Playing hard to get?
You're pretty, huh?

284
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,740
Of course!

285
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,700
My sissy bowled him over.

286
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,869
That's a gymnast and future Olympian!

287
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,581
- Come on!
- Enough of that.

288
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,499
Drink up.

289
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,167
She doesn't drink.

290
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,919
Whatever. Cheers!

291
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,545
- Cheers.
- Such a drag.

292
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,216
It's her thing. You guys are not gymnasts.

293
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,638
Hey!

294
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,765
Hey!

295
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,351
Okay, Sunshine!

296
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,605
What the f--

297
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,984
What are you doing here?

298
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,360
Come here.

299
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,946
Why did you follow me here?
What the hell are you doing?

300
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,073
What's gotten into you?
Suddenly you're into beer?

301
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,241
It's just one bottle.

302
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,867
You said the same with Miggy.

303
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,494
- Look what happened.
- Come here.

304
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,289
So you believe all the stuff you read
about killing the baby with beer?

305
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,416
Too loud.

306
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,963
Can you get me food? I'm hungry.

307
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,299
What food? I don't have money.

308
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,175
Stay there.

309
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,898
DEAR, WHAT HAPPENED? WHY DID YOU
GET DIZZY? WHAT DID THE NURSE SAY?

310
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:05,407
I JUST WASN'T ABLE TO EAT ON TIME.

311
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,586
Hey.

312
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,088
What's wrong with you?

313
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,217
Alex and I might fuck.
Aren't you happy for me?

314
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,260
What?

315
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:26,803
Hey.

316
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,182
What?

317
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:41,109
Thea, I will tell you something,
but keep it shut.

318
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,278
What's going on?

319
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,321
What is it?

320
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,453
I'm pregnant.

321
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,918
Hey. I said I'm pregnant.

322
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,128
Yeah, idiot. I heard.

323
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,174
How?

324
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,803
Ever heard of a condom?
Miggy didn't have one on?

325
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,930
Why did you guys go bare?

326
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,641
He said he'll pull out.

327
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,434
- That asshole.
- I don't know.

328
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,023
Aren't the qualifiers coming up?

329
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,900
In two months, right?

330
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,239
Guys, what's with the faces!

331
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,033
We're supposed
to be happy tonight, right?

332
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,702
Hey, waiter!

333
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,163
Can we get some snappier beats?

334
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,165
Enough of our drama.

335
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,335
Here's my number.

336
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,170
Why do you do this.

337
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,757
I was at the restroom earlier.

338
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,344
Fuck you!

339
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,600
Gracie…

340
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,310
Let me.

341
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,147
Let's start training.

342
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,523
Go and prepare.

343
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,026
Rod.

344
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:47,944
Get out of bed.

345
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,499
Sunshine, relax those arms a bit.

346
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,545
There. You were too stiff.

347
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,713
Better.

348
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,184
Exaggerate more.

349
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,103
There.

350
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,730
All right. How's this?

351
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,442
Shoulders. Very good.

352
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,902
SEA Games.

353
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,654
Worlds.

354
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,030
Shoulders.

355
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,032
Very good. Olympics.

356
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:35,909
Nice.

357
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,037
Rod!

358
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,248
What the hell?

359
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,000
You woke up late again.

360
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,087
Be quick in the shower.
Sunshine will be late for school.

361
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,463
I'll just charge my phone.

362
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,174
I can't go to school.
I feel a fever coming on.

363
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,760
Don't get me started.

364
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,346
What do you mean, fever?
I was holding you the whole time.

365
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,931
You're not even warm.

366
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,769
My little Gracie is all sweaty.

367
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:03,687
Here.

368
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,897
Auntie Sunshine.

369
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,107
Take the baby first.

370
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,109
She's been sweating. Go fan her.

371
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,029
Check if her nappy needs changing.

372
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,990
This won't take long. Just one bottle.

373
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,329
She pooped.

374
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,332
Go on, get her changed.
This is one bottle. It'll be quick.

375
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,042
I'll hurry up.

376
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,336
You do it, Rod.

377
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,046
Why me?

378
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,840
I'm older than you and I said so.
Take her.

379
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,802
- I'm not her mother!
- Jerk, I'm asking nicely. I want to rest.

380
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,513
- Come on!
- I'm also tired.

381
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,265
I didn't get to sleep.
You guys were so loud last night.

382
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,851
You were on that stupid game
of yours all night!

383
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,228
I wasn't.
You always pass stuff on to me!

384
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,230
- Come on, you do it!
- She told you to do it!

385
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,565
I just had my stretches!

386
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,609
Enough! Here's the knife!
Just go stab each other!

387
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,696
- It's his fault!
- No, stop talking.

388
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,573
Let's just fight it out!
Between tired people!

389
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,366
Let's see who will win!
Here you go.

390
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,582
Now you're crying!

391
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,083
Stop that!

392
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,086
I said stop crying!

393
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,339
Stop.

394
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:13,840
Stop!

395
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,052
I said stop.

396
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,136
Sunshine!

397
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,387
Seriously?

398
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,473
You think Gracie knows what to do?

399
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,267
Okay, look here!

400
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,279
Don't cry anymore!

401
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,656
What the heck.

402
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,825
Shit.

403
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,578
Big girl still doesn't know how to poop.

404
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,292
Still gonna poop?

405
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,044
Are you good?

406
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,796
Are you done?

407
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,273
Are you not feeling well?

408
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,376
- Hi, Sunshine.
- Hello.

409
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,437
That one right?

410
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,189
The weather?

411
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,400
Thea!

412
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,359
I'll go ahead.

413
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,237
Hey, Thea. What's the problem?

414
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,072
Thea.

415
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,491
What's wrong?

416
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,162
I just need to get something.

417
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,747
But the break just started.

418
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,753
Hey.

419
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,713
Is something wrong?

420
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,471
Mom doesn't want me
to hang out with you for now.

421
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,972
What?

422
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,015
Why?

423
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,103
Thea, you told your mom?

424
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:37,567
Mom noticed how bothered I was.

425
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,736
She told me

426
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,863
not to hang out with you.

427
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,783
Thea, I'm just pregnant.
It's not contagious.

428
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,160
Sorry, Sunshine.

429
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,079
I don't want this too.

430
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,207
But my mom said so.

431
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,167
Sorry.

432
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,877
- Thea.
- Sorry.

433
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,045
Thea!

434
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,511
You got this.

435
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,013
Focus.

436
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,015
Trust, Shine.

437
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,949
The eyes!

438
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,452
Ribbon's not keeping up!

439
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,080
Okay, good.

440
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,128
Just carry on. Keep going.

441
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,713
Okay, chin up!

442
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,135
Okay.

443
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,711
Keep going! Go!

444
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,425
What's up? You can still save
your routine!

445
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,260
You just gave up!

446
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,553
Sorry, Coach.

447
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,847
You're not focused!

448
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,269
I know you. Don't keep it inside.

449
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:43,359
When you're in here,
leave your problems behind.

450
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,946
That thing in your head,
how long will that last?

451
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,573
Weeks or months.

452
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,325
But this…

453
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,785
This has been with you forever.

454
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,537
Right?

455
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,916
When did you start with me? 11?

456
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,126
Almost 11, Coach.

457
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,085
Ten.

458
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,422
You've had this dream
for nine years, dear.

459
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,551
Don't let your problem get the upper hand.
It's a momentary thing.

460
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,013
Drown out the noise.

461
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,890
You're Sunshine.

462
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,309
Olympian. Okay?

463
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,269
Look at me.

464
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,022
Do this for yourself.

465
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,775
Not for the judges.

466
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,485
Not for the audience.

467
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,154
For yourself.

468
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,157
Okay?

469
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,450
Chin up.

470
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,118
Chin up.

471
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,745
Again?

472
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,629
Focus, Sunshine, focus.

473
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,797
You got this.

474
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,674
You got this.

475
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,480
It's just your baby girl.

476
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,982
Wanna join us?

477
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,150
What?

478
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,573
- What the fuck, Shine!
- What?

479
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,659
Don't try to make a scene again
or I'll ruin your life.

480
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,120
- Really? As if you haven't yet?
- What?

481
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,539
I told you already.
Get rid of that ASAP!

482
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,915
Give me money!

483
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,917
What the fuck.

484
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,502
You're asking from me?

485
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,254
Of course! Who didn't wear the condom?

486
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,840
- But you enjoyed it too, right?
- Fuck you!

487
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,092
Should I ask from you or your pastor dad?

488
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,635
What?

489
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,055
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you too!

490
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,351
Here.

491
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,187
- Hey, don't tell my Dad about this.
- Asshole. Go fuck yourself. Never.

492
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,689
Fuck you, asshole!

493
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,315
Get that shit done!

494
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,442
Asshole!

495
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,096
You need anything?

496
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,183
Come, I have something here.

497
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,268
How far along?

498
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,355
I'm not really sure, but…

499
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,441
Three months?

500
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:32,528
Or maybe past that.
I'm really not sure.

501
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,447
You have to know that, kid.

502
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,492
But nevermind. That's fine.

503
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,327
How much does it cost?

504
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,787
$70.

505
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,622
Is that the last price?

506
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,082
I just borrowed money.

507
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:48,336
I can't. It's really expensive.

508
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,089
The cheap ones are not effective.

509
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,216
- And yours is effective?
- Yes!

510
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,425
Wait.

511
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,888
The cheap ones will just expel the lining.

512
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,348
This one… Hold on.

513
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,933
Let me show you.

514
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,311
Here.

515
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,356
This one. She bought from me last week.

516
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,649
Effective!

517
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,775
She bled.

518
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,944
She already had two kids.

519
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,655
She couldn't take another pregnancy.

520
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,406
- So?
- Okay.

521
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,658
That one.

522
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,034
You're good with it?

523
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,750
- You're not an asset?
- I'm not.

524
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,877
- Are you sure?
- Yes, ma'am.

525
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,965
- Are you sure?
- I'm not an asset.

526
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,601
Here's the procedure.

527
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,813
You push it inside your vagina.

528
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,274
You'll feel it when it's right in.

529
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,109
Make sure it's not too shallow.

530
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,527
Just push it right in.

531
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,945
You can't eat.

532
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,991
- You have to fast for 12 hours.
- Okay.

533
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,160
You can't take anything cold.

534
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,287
You can't take anything sour.

535
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,373
- In 12 hours, right?
- Yes.

536
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,708
You understand me?

537
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,002
Okay.

538
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,839
- $70, right?
- Yes.

539
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,599
Okay.

540
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,684
$60 will do. I'll give you a discount.

541
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,686
Thank you, ma'am.

542
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,440
Be careful.

543
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,483
I will.

544
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,288
Miss…

545
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,497
Miss…

546
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,791
- Miss, maybe you can--
- I have no money, kid.

547
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,362
- Hey!
- Son of a--

548
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,947
Mother.

549
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,573
You're here again!

550
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,035
I have to go. I have something to do.

551
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,870
- I'll come with you!
- No. You can't come.

552
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,622
No kids allowed there.

553
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,790
Why?

554
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,667
Are you up to something bad?

555
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,015
Why are you running away?

556
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,937
What if Coach finds out?

557
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,525
Are you absolutely sure?

558
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,195
Final answer?

559
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,706
You must be trembling in fear now!

560
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,417
Are you afraid?

561
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,669
I bet you are!

562
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,088
Johnny Boy!

563
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,680
You're all alone?

564
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,723
Yes.

565
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,266
Johnny Boy!

566
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,352
Johnny Boy.

567
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,728
Check out Room 206.

568
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,856
They've been in there too long.
Don't know if they'll keep it going.

569
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,066
Knock on their door.

570
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,359
Okay.

571
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,943
- Yes, miss?
- Twelve hours--

572
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,404
Johnny Boy, enough with the video games!

573
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,031
I'll stay for 12 hours.

574
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,241
Sorry, miss.

575
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,370
We don't accept solo check-ins.

576
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,663
You might kill yourself in our bathroom.

577
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,915
I won't.

578
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,291
I'll just be sleeping.

579
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,795
Fine. Payment first.

580
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,464
How much?

581
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,382
$6.

582
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,427
Here you go.

583
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:01,185
THEA, I KNOW I'M NO LONGER YOUR FRIEND,
BUT I AM HERE AT AVENIDA INN.

584
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:06,857
IF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS TO ME,
I'M IN ROOM 215. I LOVE YOU, SIS.

585
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,713
Shit!

586
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:41,267
LOVE YOU TOO, SIS.
DON'T WORRY, I WON'T LEAVE YOU.

587
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,852
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
LOVE YOU, SIS.

588
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,055
Ma'am…

589
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,890
Please help me, I can't take it anymore.

590
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,600
- I can't take it--
- Oh, my!

591
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,270
You motherfucker, I knew it!

592
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,521
Hey, Baby!

593
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,857
Baby, give me a hand here! Now!

594
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,191
There's blood all over!

595
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,609
Johnny Boy!

596
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,735
Johnny Boy!

597
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,114
Get a tricycle! Hurry!

598
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,616
Can you still make it, kid?

599
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,118
You go first.

600
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,661
You go first, Baby. That's it!

601
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:51,373
You're bleeding all over!
What the hell did you do?

602
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,791
My God!

603
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,420
Will she even make it?

604
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,299
Where the hell is that tricycle!

605
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,218
Kid, hang in there.

606
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,596
Don't give up!

607
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:06,597
Baby, Baby!

608
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,599
You take the other side!

609
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,267
Johnny Boy!

610
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,810
Give me a hand here. Hurry.

611
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:12,728
Gently, gently.

612
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,152
Take her to the hospital.
I'll pay you when you get back.

613
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,236
Go! Go!

614
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,412
Hurry up, please!

615
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,874
Sunshine, wake up!

616
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:37,920
We're going to the Olympics!
And the SEA Games!

617
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,464
Sunshine!

618
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,926
Olympics is our dream!

619
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,011
We're off to SEA Games!

620
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,679
We gotta stick to the plan!

621
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,225
Ma'am, go faster, please!

622
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:01,485
Wake up! We've got
the SEA Games, remember?

623
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,250
How are you?

624
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,794
Are you feeling pain anywhere?

625
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,296
Do you feel hot? Hold on.

626
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:28,470
If there's anything you need,
don't be afraid to tell us.

627
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,057
The kid is awake.

628
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,769
Looks like you did something bad.

629
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,480
And I don't like it.

630
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,190
Because I love children.

631
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,235
It's against the law.

632
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:46,947
And more importantly,
it's against the law of God.

633
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,827
You have to ask God the Father
for forgiveness.

634
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:52,995
Go on.

635
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,122
Ask for forgiveness.

636
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,169
I'm so--

637
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,631
Sorry, God the Father.

638
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,925
You have to be thankful, miss.

639
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:11,430
Our God is a forgiving God.

640
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:17,728
He kept you alive even if you wanted
to kill your baby. Who is also His child.

641
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,147
Thank God the Father.

642
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,232
Be thankful to Him!

643
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,484
Thank you,

644
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,029
God the Father.

645
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,780
As for your baby,

646
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:33,452
even if you wanted to get rid of him,
he still wishes to be born!

647
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,705
He held on for dear life.

648
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,458
Praise the Lord he didn't die!

649
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,127
Go on, give grace!

650
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,839
Thank you…

651
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:47,799
For what?

652
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,345
Good God.

653
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,972
You poor thing.

654
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:58,018
What if you're carrying
the future president of the Philippines?

655
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,771
If he will eventually discover
the cure for AIDS?

656
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,857
You're so young and you're damaged goods!

657
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,193
- May the Lord forgive--
- Who are you again?

658
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,613
Dra. Asuncion, OB-GYN.

659
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,948
Are you a patient?

660
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,659
We don't allow visitors here.

661
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,285
I see.

662
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,663
We're not even related after all.

663
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,250
I got confused with how
you berated my sister.

664
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,336
I thought you were our mother.

665
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,547
She's discharged.

666
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,091
Head to the cashier.

667
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,884
The total bill is $26.

668
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,219
That's steep!

669
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,596
Isn't all this free?

670
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,099
According to your merciful God,

671
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,141
be kind!

672
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,394
It says so in the Bible!

673
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,743
Sis, I'm sorry.

674
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,082
Don't go to school.

675
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,543
You need to rest.

676
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,587
I will still go.

677
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,715
I said it's fine.

678
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,009
It's totally fine if you miss school.

679
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,720
You really need to rest.

680
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,556
I still have training tomorrow.

681
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,099
Are you crazy?

682
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,143
Sis, the SEA Games are coming up.

683
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,061
SEA Games?

684
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,189
It's funny
how you can still think of gymnastics.

685
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,608
It's my only dream.
And you know it.

686
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,779
Whatever I'm going through,
I'll still pursue gymnastics.

687
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,286
WOW, SO YOU GET TO SAY YOU'RE ANGRY.

688
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,705
YOU'RE REALLY SOMETHING ELSE!

689
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,135
Sunshine!

690
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,681
Here's our order.

691
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,516
Morning.

692
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,434
Thank you, Coach.

693
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,352
Here.

694
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,328
Anything you want to tell me?

695
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,541
None that I know, Coach.

696
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,716
I see you as a daughter, Sunshine.

697
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,218
You can tell me anything.

698
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,226
Coach, I…

699
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,732
About my performance music, Coach.

700
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,984
I feel like changing it.

701
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:19,029
I'm not feeling it.

702
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:22,741
It lacks something. It lacks heart.

703
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,163
Could be too late.

704
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,042
But I suppose it could work.

705
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,169
- Triple the effort.
- Yes, Coach.

706
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,296
- Just make up your mind.
- Thank you, Coach.

707
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,632
Thank you, Coach.

708
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,469
And what is this I'm hearing…

709
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,264
What have you heard about, Coach?

710
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,643
I know you know, Sunshine.

711
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,478
You're pregnant?

712
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,440
Because if you are,

713
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,777
I'm so sorry but I have
to remove you from the roster.

714
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,322
- Okay?
- You can't do the qualifiers!

715
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,742
- What were you thinking?
- Coach-- Pregnant?

716
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,703
All that wasted effort.
We're only two months away!

717
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,538
Coach, I'm not pregnant.

718
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,667
Coach, that's not true.

719
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,506
You're this close.

720
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:23,093
Coach, I'm not pregnant. Come on.

721
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:29,641
I'll start, Coach.

722
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,689
It didn't work.

723
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,107
I thought you said it was effective.

724
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,442
- I told you to message me…
- Your voice!

725
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,902
…if there's a problem!

726
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,989
- Maybe you didn't follow the procedure!
- I did!

727
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:45,865
Add some.

728
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,158
I need $30 more.

729
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,410
Why do I have to give more?

730
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,704
I'll get you a stronger one.

731
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,790
That's actually $60!
I won't be earning from this anymore.

732
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,750
$10, nothing more.

733
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,085
$10 and I'll take it.

734
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,172
I'm helping you out here.

735
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,134
Wait for me here.

736
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,150
Here.

737
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,861
- That's a stronger one.
- Make sure this isn't a scam.

738
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,112
I never scam people.

739
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,031
- I've long been a seller here.
- Really now?

740
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,878
Fuck you, Miggy.

741
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,047
You good-for-nothing jerk.

742
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:17,332
Miss.

743
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,918
- Can I have some--
- This is nothing!

744
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,128
- You're keeping it for yourself.
- No!

745
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,256
- What the fuck.
- Well, fuck you, too.

746
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,134
Fuck. Are you also pregnant?

747
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,430
How far along?

748
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,726
I only found out the other day.

749
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,771
My belly was bloating.

750
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,440
I thought I had worms.

751
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:45,235
And bam… Turns out I'm pregnant.

752
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,988
Do you get yourself checked?

753
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,907
You're really showing now.

754
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,660
Check up? That's expensive.

755
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,703
Have your boyfriend pay for it!

756
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,583
He's not my boyfriend.

757
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,504
He's my uncle.

758
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,430
What's your plan?

759
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:17,851
Don't know.

760
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,354
The ones that make you bleed
are too pricey!

761
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:28,820
I don't have enough money,
but they say there's a faith healer.

762
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,030
I just have to go to her house.

763
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,878
This is all I have.

764
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,718
I hope this helps.
I know it's not much, but--

765
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,679
Miss, thank you.

766
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,222
This is a lot of help.

767
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:08,568
This is really a lot of help. Thank you.

768
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,278
Hey, wait for me!

769
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,326
Stay…

770
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,870
- Stay here. I'll come back for you.
- Big sis…

771
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,830
Thank you.

772
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,832
Really.

773
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,960
- Thanks a lot.
- Just stay here. I'll be back.

774
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,217
Where are you?

775
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,762
Come on, let me know where you are!

776
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,682
Lighten up!

777
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,606
We're quits! I'm not making it
to the national team.

778
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,988
Sunshine!

779
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,115
How are you?

780
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,872
Where have you been?

781
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,917
Chill, I'm not mad. Relax.

782
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,545
Been exploring your turf,
and it's super busy!

783
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,463
By the way, I met a new friend.

784
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,090
Look.

785
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,383
Ariana!

786
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,056
I followed her.

787
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,141
My new friend, Ariana.

788
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,770
<i>Slay! Slay! Slay!</i>

789
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:27,605
Ariana…

790
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,898
Wait.

791
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:31,818
Hello.

792
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,069
And the other cheek too.

793
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,364
Ariana, this is Sunshine.

794
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,241
Sunshine, this is Ariana.

795
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,577
It's Ari-yuh-nuh.

796
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,496
Ariana's my favorite singer.

797
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,832
She's my bitch.

798
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,417
Actually, I ran away from home.

799
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,670
I hate it there.

800
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,923
Small, cramped, sticky.

801
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,717
Creeping with junkies.

802
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,802
Also, my Uncle Bobot

803
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,638
is the devil incarnate.

804
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,473
Shit.

805
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,516
I know you.

806
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,477
- Where's your house? I'm taking you home.
- No!

807
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,396
What do you mean, no?
I'll bring you home. Come on.

808
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,732
- I said I hate it there!
- I'm taking you home. Or else…

809
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:11,649
Come on.

810
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,736
Why are you threatening me?
Are you my mother?

811
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:17,322
I'm not, but they're worried about you.
Let's go.

812
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,489
Worried?

813
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,158
They don't give a damn about me!

814
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:23,077
She's just very confused, okay?
Don't judge.

815
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,705
Can you not meddle?
Convo not suitable for adults!

816
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,248
Well I'm a kid, too.

817
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,083
That's why I don't want to be a mom.

818
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,211
Hey.

819
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,964
Stand back! Over there.

820
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:36,633
Faster.

821
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:38,051
What's this?

822
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,678
Why are you okay with all this?

823
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:41,763
Are you crazy?

824
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,848
Don't you want to see
the chic party streets?

825
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:45,475
To feel loved?

826
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,895
Or be the first gay president
of the Philippines?

827
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,105
How can you be president?

828
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,815
Can they even afford
to send you to school at all?

829
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,776
I'll get into show business first.

830
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:55,943
Why?

831
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,738
I don't even need to go to school.

832
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,741
How about you?
Do you even have dreams?

833
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,994
My dreams are her dreams.

834
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:08,081
Get a load of us.
We're going to the Olympics.

835
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,375
Right?

836
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,461
Just agree.

837
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,379
Right.

838
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,173
And get a load of us.

839
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:20,677
She was knocked up by her uncle.

840
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,137
Fuck this life.

841
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:31,854
Are you all right?

842
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,816
Hey.

843
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:35,983
What's going on?

844
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,318
- What happened?
- What happened?

845
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,277
What's up?

846
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,155
- Hey, we're here with you!
- We're here with you.

847
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,372
Wait.

848
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,331
What?

849
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,999
Something's going on in our house.

850
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,210
- Hey!
- Hey!

851
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:55,128
Come on.

852
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,045
Hey!

853
01:01:58,589 --> 01:01:59,674
Hey, beautiful!

854
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:00,758
Where are you headed?

855
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:03,511
We'll give you a good time!

856
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,307
What do you want? You jerk!

857
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,017
Go fuck yourself!

858
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:21,529
She's not here!

859
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:24,073
Maybe she's in that place
from the other night!

860
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,032
Help!

861
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,117
Help!

862
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,661
Help us out here for a moment!

863
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,912
No way!

864
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,789
Help!

865
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,207
Be quick!

866
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,086
Wake her up!

867
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,885
Lift her!

868
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,804
Call a taxi! Someone call a taxi!

869
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,640
Hurry up! Run for a taxi if you have to!

870
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:50,975
Go on!

871
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,436
Get me a taxi, quickly!

872
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,353
Hurry up!

873
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,439
Make way! Just don't…

874
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:58,024
Keep her awake! Wake her up!

875
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:12,497
Big sis, don't let me die.

876
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,248
Just hang on.

877
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:17,627
Don't fall asleep!
You can do it. Hold on.

878
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,629
I can't do this anymore!

879
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,799
You won't die! You can do this!

880
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,426
Just hang on. Don't close your eyes!

881
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,594
Sir!

882
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,846
Hurry up, please!

883
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,641
We still have to make that Bobot pay!

884
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,893
That son of a bitch!

885
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,229
Don't close your eyes!

886
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,897
Wake her up!

887
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:42,151
Can't you go any faster?

888
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:45,321
Hurry!

889
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,673
Over here, help!

890
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:07,635
Please take it from here.
They will recognize me.

891
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:11,556
Here! Pay the hospital
with what she paid me!

892
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:12,765
I will pray for all of you!

893
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,100
Go on!

894
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,059
Go!

895
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:16,102
Please!

896
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,230
Sir, don't let her die, please!

897
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,774
Hang in there!

898
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,989
Don't let my friend die, please!

899
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,907
Don't let her die!

900
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:33,703
- Please!
- Ariana?

901
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,162
- Nurse, please!
- Ariana?

902
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,122
Doc!

903
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,417
Doc, please. Don't let her die, Doc!
Please have mercy.

904
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,669
Your friend had an abortion,
didn't you know?

905
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,379
That's illegal!

906
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,214
I'm sorry!

907
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,883
I can't have your friend here.

908
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,509
- It'll put my license on the line!
- Please, Doc, please!

909
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,636
- Please, Doc!
- I'm sorry, miss!

910
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,804
Find another doctor.

911
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,031
It's all right.

912
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,532
I'll handle this.

913
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,327
Doc, let me just find some money.

914
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,162
It's all right.

915
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,039
Doc, thank you!

916
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:18,956
Okay.

917
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:20,958
I'll go ahead.

918
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,336
Doc…

919
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:33,429
Miss?

920
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:34,388
Miss?

921
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,389
Yes?

922
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:38,225
Were you with the 13-year-old?

923
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:43,856
Were you the one with the 13-year-old?

924
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:46,025
Thirteen?

925
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,737
She's only 13?

926
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:52,657
She was in critical condition earlier.

927
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,242
But her vital signs are now stable.

928
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,495
We're transferring her
to the maternity ward.

929
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,288
She lost the baby.

930
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,333
But at least, your friend is alive.

931
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,543
Don't worry about payment.

932
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,545
You got lucky with Dra. Helena.

933
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,463
All right then.

934
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:11,550
Hey!

935
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,260
You can't go in there, all right?

936
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,755
Is that your first?

937
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,382
Here. Take my extra.

938
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,676
You can bring that home.

939
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:55,094
- Thank you.
- Is it a boy?

940
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,471
- Yes.
- Lucky for you!

941
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,682
I've had four girls.

942
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,811
Like this, all right?
Be careful with the neck.

943
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,108
Do it like this.

944
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,192
There you go.

945
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:28,252
I'm sorry.

946
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:32,757
I'm sorry. Hang in there, all right?

947
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,883
Hold on.

948
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,385
You're gonna be all right.

949
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,145
Let's hang in there, all right?

950
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,146
Ariana?

951
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,231
Ariana!

952
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,025
Have you seen Ariana?

953
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:52,568
This tall.

954
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,236
A gay kid wearing a headband.

955
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,531
When someone is talking to you,
you respond!

956
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:58,991
Fuck you!

957
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,201
Fuck you too!

958
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:05,081
Kid!

959
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,337
Where is Ariana?

960
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:14,256
- What?
- Stop.

961
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:20,221
Enough. Calm down.

962
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:24,892
Calm down now.
What's important is that she's better now.

963
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,268
She's doing fine, look!

964
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,355
Where's Ariana?

965
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:32,108
I don't know. Please calm down.

966
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,401
Hey, kid!

967
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,528
Kid!

968
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,779
Come on!

969
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,823
Don't you dare follow me.

970
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,407
You motherfucking slut!

971
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:51,752
Yeah, you could get lucky
with Tino's sloppy seconds!

972
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,212
That has Tino's scent!

973
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:56,132
I'm not interested, bro.

974
01:08:56,215 --> 01:09:00,845
Since high school,
he's been all about pussy!

975
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:05,474
This place is open for you every night.

976
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,894
Nothing like the free rides here!

977
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:13,482
Is this where Mary Grace lives?

978
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,442
Mary Grace's house.

979
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,278
Does Mary Grace live here?

980
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:20,739
Why?

981
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:23,075
You're her mother?

982
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:24,869
Yes. Why?

983
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:27,663
Your child is in the hospital.

984
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,501
You have to sign her papers
to get her out.

985
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,503
Here's a list of her meds.

986
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,089
That dyke stirring up shit again!

987
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:40,634
That fucker wants me to pay for this?

988
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,763
Bobot…

989
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,600
so sorry about this.

990
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,435
Can I borrow from you again?

991
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,354
No problem!

992
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:57,443
- Always a deal.
- Thank you!

993
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:01,071
I really love my niece.
And she gives me love too.

994
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:04,575
She's a troublemaker and a pest.
She's just useless.

995
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:05,951
Good for nothing.

996
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,411
Now look at this new problem.

997
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,538
You motherfucker!

998
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:10,456
Bobot!

999
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:11,707
You bitch!

1000
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,328
Sis, here.

1001
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:33,372
This is from Dra. Helena.

1002
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,666
She says this is her private clinic.

1003
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:39,336
She's over here MWF, 1 to 4 p.m.

1004
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:43,465
But she says we can message her
anytime we need.

1005
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:48,012
Don't worry, sis.
I didn't tell her your name.

1006
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:08,991
Sunshine?

1007
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,079
Sunshine.

1008
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:17,082
Yes?

1009
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:25,424
Are you all right?

1010
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:34,058
Miggy and his dad are here.

1011
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,394
Do you want to face them?

1012
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:46,236
Just let me know, Sunshine.

1013
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:16,225
Here's my sister.

1014
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:18,227
I hope you don't take long.

1015
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,312
We're busy.

1016
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,355
Sunshine!

1017
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,649
I'm Pastor Jaime.

1018
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:24,942
Miguel's dad.

1019
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:26,610
Let's talk.

1020
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:31,573
Hey, Shine.

1021
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:39,665
I'm sorry we had to meet
under these circumstances.

1022
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:44,461
Anyway, Miggy has told me
about your situation.

1023
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:47,339
His mom and I have also discussed it,

1024
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:51,176
and Miggy has something to tell you.

1025
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:58,392
I'm sorry.

1026
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,855
I'm really very sorry.

1027
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:09,111
I didn't want you to think
that I didn't want our child.

1028
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:17,369
I talked to Dad
and he knocked some sense into me.

1029
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:22,249
That's why I'm really very sorry, Shine.

1030
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:26,170
I love you,

1031
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:28,547
and

1032
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:30,632
I love our baby.

1033
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:34,178
And I will do everything
to be the best dad for him.

1034
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:40,809
And?

1035
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:41,852
And?

1036
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:43,562
And…

1037
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:48,650
We've decided to cover
for all the expenses that you will incur

1038
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,235
from now on until

1039
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:52,863
your child is 18.

1040
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:54,656
Or until you want us to help.

1041
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:58,118
We'll be with you every step of the way,

1042
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,787
so that you can be
the best parents that you can be.

1043
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:01,914
For the child.

1044
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:03,749
Yeah.

1045
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:04,917
Dad's correct…

1046
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:07,586
even if I'm scared…

1047
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:09,963
I'm really scared.

1048
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,549
I'm not ready to be a dad yet.

1049
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:17,262
And it's not even a part of my plan,
but we'll figure things out

1050
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:20,140
along the way, right?

1051
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:22,476
Right?

1052
01:15:28,982 --> 01:15:30,526
Don't worry, kid.

1053
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,861
We'll be here to guide you.

1054
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,114
To guide your son.

1055
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:40,410
If you want to send the child
to any school.

1056
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,871
Ateneo, La Salle…

1057
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:45,582
If you want the child
to become a doctor or lawyer,

1058
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,794
we'll make it happen
with the Lord's grace.

1059
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:49,878
Amen.

1060
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:51,588
Don't be afraid, Sunshine.

1061
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:53,006
Miggy.

1062
01:15:56,009 --> 01:15:59,096
By the way, who's your OB-GYN?

1063
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:03,433
It would be best if you go
to Dra. Tanangco.

1064
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,727
She's our family doctor.

1065
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:08,230
She's very good, Sunshine.
She works at the top hospital, he--

1066
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:09,439
No need, sir.

1067
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,068
Sunshine.

1068
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,028
Don't hesitate, child.

1069
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,531
- That's also my grandchild--
- No, that's not it.

1070
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:19,700
I don't want to be a mother.

1071
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:30,419
What do you mean?

1072
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:31,712
I don't want to be a mother.

1073
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:33,922
I am not having this baby
because I am not ready to be a mother.

1074
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:37,134
Sunshine, hey. I'm sorry.

1075
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,014
- Dad will take care of everything.
- That's not the point, Miggy.

1076
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,433
- We'll raise this kid together!
- What else could you ask for?

1077
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:46,768
- We're already shouldering--
- I don't want to be a mother!

1078
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,520
Why does that involve you?

1079
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:52,065
- Shine!
- Enough of this.

1080
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:55,861
Go now.

1081
01:16:57,821 --> 01:16:58,864
You can go.

1082
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,242
Rod, get the door.

1083
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:03,243
You gotta go.

1084
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:04,870
She said go.

1085
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:07,122
Now.

1086
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:11,335
Talk some sense into your sister.

1087
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:26,183
Sunshine?

1088
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,939
Sunshine?

1089
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,826
Sunshine…

1090
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:34,167
I love you very much.

1091
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:42,634
Whatever…

1092
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,806
Whatever you decide on…

1093
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,854
whatever happens…

1094
01:18:57,941 --> 01:18:59,359
I'm on your side.

1095
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,493
I'm always on your side.

1096
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:21,757
I love you so much.

1097
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:03,924
Sis…

1098
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,652
Do you understand me?

1099
01:23:57,991 --> 01:23:59,117
I get it.

1100
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,703
I get it now.

1101
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,851
Next gymnast,

1102
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:28,229
