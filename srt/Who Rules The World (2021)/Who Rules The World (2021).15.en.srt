Father!

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,720
Master!

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,520
How did you end up here?

32
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,600
Father.

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Father.

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,919
Martial Sister learned
from the Fountain Abode

35
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,320
that you were heading here to Mount Wu.

36
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:20,880
So she took us here to search for you.

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,520
I was so worried

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,399
when you suddenly disappeared.

39
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,360
Why are you here, Master?

40
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,880
Those who failed the trial
would come here

41
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,039
by all sorts of means.

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,119
I supposed Old Taiyin was not willing

43
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,279
to reveal the details of the trials.

44
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:37,279
That's why he trapped
us here temporarily.

45
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,160
Fortunately, there's plenty
of food and water

46
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,800
in this valley.

47
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,160
We can only wait

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,559
for someone to pass the trial

49
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,479
and save us from this place.

50
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:47,759
I see.

51
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:49,119
Martial Sister hasn't lost yet.

52
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,199
So we still have hope.

53
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,279
I'll let you settle down first.

54
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,440
I want you to tell me

55
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,679
what happened these days.

56
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,360
Come in.

59
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:05,000
(to use me to tie Lanxi down this time.)

60
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,520
(I can't let Lanxi get distracted
because of me.)

61
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,720
Your Highness,

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,839
please stop drinking.

63
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:15,039
Are you trying to control me too?

64
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,320
No one here treats me as the prince.

65
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,399
Your Highness,

66
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,639
drowning yourself in sorrows
with wine will

67
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,800
only make you feel worse, Your Highness.

68
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,960
Father despises me.

69
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,440
Mother uses me.

70
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,679
Even my brother,
whom I cared for the most,

71
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,639
lied to me.

72
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,000
Your Highness.

73
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,960
You can't...

74
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,000
Your Highness.

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,919
Greetings,

76
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,360
Prince Yongping.

77
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
What are you doing here?

78
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,399
I already know

79
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:57,679
about today.

80
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,600
If you're not willing to marry Qi Cheng,

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,600
I have a plan to persuade Father

82
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,839
to decline this betrothal.

83
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,039
You? Helping me?

84
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,320
You can say what you want.

85
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,160
You're the same as Mother,

86
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,079
who only used me

87
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,160
as a pawn in your strife.

88
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,440
Can't you see how Mother feels?

89
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,079
You're doing this

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,720
to win her. That's all.

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Is that what you think of me?

92
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,279
What do I think of you?

93
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,839
What else do you expect?

94
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,760
No matter how I tried,

95
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,640
I can't see through you.

96
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:43,679
Your Highness!

97
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,920
You have great martial arts skills.

98
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,079
You do.

99
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,320
But your skills in scheming are
higher than your martial arts.

100
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,480
Chang,

101
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,640
there are some things
I still can't explain to you yet.

102
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,760
But I've never plotted against you.

103
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,959
Do you think I'd still believe you

104
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,880
if you said all these?

105
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,480
You don't have to interfere
with Miss Qi Cheng anymore.

106
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,200
Leave.

107
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,160
(Chang has to marry
someone he doesn't love)

108
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,760
(because of me.)

109
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,480
(I'm sure he hates me.)

110
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,519
(The more cluttered my thoughts are,)

111
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,079
(the more I think of her.)

112
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,119
(How is she doing in Mount Wu?)

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,079
(This path is indeed)

114
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,040
(accompanied by loneliness.)

116
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,000

hard questions to people.

118
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,760
We only got out from the maple grove.
Now, we have to cross this cliff.

119
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,160
He wants to stop us?

120
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,160
I won't let him get what he wants.

121
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,200
Why don't we compete

122

and see who reaches
the other side first?

123

One horse costs ten silver leaves.

155

To stop me from getting fine horses,

156
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,239
Wang Minghai would spend this much.

157
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,559
The price for the army
to purchase a horse in the north was

158

three silver leaves for a horse.

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,200
The horse's price in the
eastern frontier has increased so much.

160
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,280
If we buy at this price

161
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
based on His Lordship's request,

162
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
we'll lose a lot of money.

Even if I'm willing

00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,400
of the money's origin.

169
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:00,919
When that time comes,

170
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
we'll be exposed.

171
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,799
Then...

172
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,599
What should we do, then?

173
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,280
I'll write a letter

174
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,760
for Chuanyun and the rest.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,400
Yes, Your Highness.

176
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,479
(Noodles)
Ten silver leaves for one horse?

177
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:15,880
That's equivalent to robbing.

178
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,080
No, it's not.

179
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,640
They're just pushing us off the cliff,

180
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,760
so we can't buy horses.

181
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,400
They only spent several thousand
silver leaves

182
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,280
buying hundreds of horses
to increase the horses' price.

183
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,520
But we need more than
ten thousand horses.

184
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,880
(Noodles)
Let's see what His Highness says.

185
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,400
Excuse me. Are you here to buy horses?

186
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:33,719
Yes.

187
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,000
But we can't afford to buy
a horse for ten silver leaves.

188
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,039
Well, it's ten silver leaves

189
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,640
because some people
manipulated the price.

190
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
People usually buy dozens of horses.

191
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,080
But I'm different.

192
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,080
I have a thousand fine horses
in my stable.

193
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,239
They can't afford to buy them all.

194
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,119
How much are you planning to sell them?

195
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:51,080
They may have pushed it up
to ten silver leaves.

196
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,840
But if you want to buy it
at the old price,

197
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,760
it would be impossible anymore.

198
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,599
My horses cost five silver leaves
for one.

199
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:59,119
Five silver leaves?

200
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,159
Chuanyun.

201
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,799
It's still expensive.

202
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,280
My horses are worth the price.

203
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,239
Why don't

204
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,880
I show them to you?

205
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,280
Chuanyun.

206
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,280
Come and take a look!

207
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,119
This way, please.

208
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,799
We're here.

209
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,840
Sirs, please examine as you like.

210
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,440
These are fine horses.

211
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,799
The horses are indeed fine.

212
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,520
But the price...

213
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,000
I can't lower the price anymore.

214
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
We'll take them all
if it's four silver leaves for one.

215
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
You have so many horses.

216
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,840
I'm sure the stable's
daily expenses are high too.

217
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,000
The earlier you sell them out,
the faster you lower your expenses.

218
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,119
Well...

219
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,520
Since you have a way
to get so many fine horses,

220
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,479
you must have your way of getting them.

221
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,880
We want more horses.

222
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,440
How about this?

223
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,239
I'll come to you first thing

224
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,960
to buy your horses

225
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,320
at four silver leaves for one horse.

226
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,320
What do you think?

227
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,799
Are you going to buy as many as I have?

228
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:57,880
Of course.

229
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,880
We're only fear
you don't have enough horses.

230
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,440
All right.

231
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,880
Four silver leaves, it is.

232
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,559
I'll get the silver leaves for you now.

233
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Wait here.

234
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,200
All right.

235
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:32,760
Sir.

236
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:34,119
You did well.

237
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,239
Here's your reward.

238
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,000
Thank you, sir.

239
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
Sir, these horses are indeed fine.

240
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,880
Don't you think
four silver leaves are too cheap?

241
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:47,960
It's not your place
to meddle in this matter.

242
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:49,840
You can leave now.

243
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,239
All right.

244
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,239
I'll take my leave.

245
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Which way should we take now?

246
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:15,359
What's the meaning of this horse?

247
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:18,479
Miss Feng, have you read books related
to the books of Yishu?

248
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,559
The Heaven trigram symbolizes strength.
A strong person rides a horse.

249
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,880
So the Heaven trigram
shows the right way.

250
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,239
You're well-learned.

251
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,799
It's in the northwest.

252
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,080
And this way is

253
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,080
to the northwest.

254
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,239
Let's go.

255
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,159
Prince Huang?

256
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,080
Master, Prince Huang Chao is here.

257
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,119
Prince Huang Chao?

258
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,440
Prince Huang?

259
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:09,520
Your Highness,

260
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,640
Chuanyu said

261
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,200
they had bought one thousand horses

262
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,080
at four silver leaves for each.

263
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,919
People from the House of Jade
are transporting the horses back.

264
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
They're expected to arrive tomorrow.

265
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,239
How did

266
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,919
the purchase of horses go?

267
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,080
The traders had bought 1,000 horses.

268
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,119
Today,

269
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,520
they've already arrived in the capital.

270
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,520
I've ordered the men to have
the Ministry of War examine them

271
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,080
to see if the horses meet
the criteria as military horses.

272
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,119
If the horses meet
the Ministry of War's requirements,

273
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,080
I can assure you

274
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:43,719
that I can hand over
all the military horses to you

275
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,960
within three days.

276
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,559
Well done.

277
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,159
Report!

278
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,799
Your Lordship, Vice Minister of War,
Official Wang requests an audience.

279
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,840
Summon him.

280
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,239
Yes, Your Lordship.

281
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,640
Your humble servant greets
Your Lordship.

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,159
Long live Your Lordship.

283
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:04,080
Drop the formalities.

284
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,520
What brings you here?

285
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:07,799
Your Lordship,

286
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,021
(Vice Minister of War, Wang Minghai)
smuggling of military horses leads

287
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,440
(Vice Minister of War, Wang Minghai)
to the shortage of military horses.

288
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:13,520
It may not be my doing.

289
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,280
But I can't escape from being at fault.

290
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,760
For Your Lordship and Yongzhou,

291
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,000
I've been investigating this matter.

292
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,080
I've found several clues these days.

293
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,280
I've found

294
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,679
the whereabouts
of those 1,000 military horses.

295
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:30,520
Does that mean

296
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,760
I'll have

297
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,000
two thousand military horses today?

298
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,239
Your Lordship,

299
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:39,000
the smuggled 1,000 military horses

300
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,159
that I've investigated

301
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,080
were

302
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,960
purchased by Prince Yongping.

303
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,640
Prince Yongping,

304
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,359
what's going on here?

305
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,000
The horses I bought came
from traders in the eastern frontier.

306
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,239
They're not military horses.

307
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,640
When military horses are registered,

308
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,599
they're nailed with special horseshoes.

309
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,479
Even if they were replaced,

310
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,520
there would be marks on their hooves.

311
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,000
It won't be hard

312
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,000
to clarify it.

313
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,440
I think you're trying

314
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,960
to slander me

315
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,280
because I took over your task.

316
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,960
If you insist on what you purchased
isn't the military horses,

317
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,359
we can all head to the Ministry of War

318
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,799
to examine them.

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,039
In that case,

320
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:33,080
we'll head to the Ministry of War, then.

321
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,479
I've wanted to see
my military horses anyway.

322
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:44,919
Greetings, Your Lordship.

323
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,559
Official Yuan,

324
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,479
have you examined

325
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,119
the horses
that Prince Yongping purchased?

326
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,039
Your Lordship,

327
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,520
we've examined

328
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,799
all the horses
that Prince Yongping had purchased.

329
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,479
They all fit the criteria
of military horses.

330
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:55,159
But...

331
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,400
But there're traces

332
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:58,479
of military horseshoes
on the hooves, right?

333
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,719
Military horseshoes on the hooves?

334
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,119
Why would Your Lordship ask this?

335
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,559
Official Yuan,

336
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,080
have you examined them closely?

337
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,400
I've examined

338
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,119
these horses one by one.

339
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,440
If you don't believe me,

340
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,039
you can examine them yourself.

341
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,080
Go on.

342
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,200
Official Yuan,

343
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,479
what made you hesitate

344
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,599
to speak just now?

345
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,000
Prince Yongping's horses were better

346
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,479
than the horses from the north.

347
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,880
I'm afraid it'll be hard

348
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,119
to divide them evenly.

349
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,719
It's difficult for me.

350
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,200
So that's what you meant.

351
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:49,039
Chuanyun,

352
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,760
didn't you see the horse mark?

353
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,799
That was obviously the mark
of military horses.

354
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,679
These horses must be
the smuggled military horses.

355
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:56,799
But why did you promise

356
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,799
to buy them?

357
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:00,559
His Highness wanted me to buy them.

358
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:01,799
His Highness?

359
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,880
His Highness knew they'd do this.

360
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,520
Do you think their plot

361
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,359
can set up His Highness?

362
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,599
They already knew

363
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,079
that we wanted to purchase 1,000 horses.

364
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,119
If we failed to deliver
the horses back to the capital,

365
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,640
wouldn't they say
His Highness is keeping

366
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,880
them for his use?

367
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,640
Calm down.

368
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,880
The person sending the horses is here.

369
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,119
Are you

370
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,520
Mr. Fengxi's men?

371
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,439
-Yes.
-Yes.

372
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,239
I'm Ma Mengqi.

373
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,719
Master Ma, you came in person.

374
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,439
Thanks to those from Fountain Abode,

375
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,959
Ma family was protected

376
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,319
when Soultaker Sect attacked us.

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,520
Now,

378
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,040
Mr. Fengxi needs a favor.

379
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,839
Of course, I have to come in person.

380
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:49,119
Most horse vendors in the
eastern frontier are close to my family.

381
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,119
I've already made the arrangements
for Mr. Fengxi.

382
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,400
He can pick up the horses anytime.

383
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,719
Now that you have examined them,

384
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,319
the horses have no problems.

385
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,479
That means

386
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,119
you've slandered me.

387
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,000
Wait...

388
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,520
I only did that to investigate
the military horses.

389
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,160
I supposed

390
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,119
I had made a mistake
in my investigation.

391
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,079
Please punish me, Your Lordship.

392
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,719
I don't think you only made
a mistake in your investigation.

393
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,719
The truth is before your eyes.

394
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:26,280
There wasn't any smuggling
of military horses.

395
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,800
But you

396
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,599
embezzled the money
to purchase the military horses,

397
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,839
and that
leads to insufficient military horses.

398
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,839
You even tried to cover it up,
pin it on someone else,

399
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,800
and kill the innocent!

400
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,959
No, Prince Yongping.

401
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,520
That's a slander.

402
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,719
Prince Yongping...

403
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,599
I've already investigated this matter.

404
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,599
Please take a look, Father.

405
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,002
(Memorial)

406
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:58,931
(The need for horses has a direct
impact on Yongzhou's battle power.)

407
00:18:58,932 --> 00:18:59,877
(Vice Minister Wang of War
smuggled horses for personal gain.)

408
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,400
Your... Your Lordship...

409
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,520
Guards.

410
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,520
Your Lordship.

411
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,400
Take Wang Minghai to the dungeon.

412
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,439
-Yes, Your Lordship.
-Your Lordship.

413
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,680
Your Lordship!

414
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,479
Since these horses fit
the criteria of the military horses,

415
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,239
don't forget

416
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,199
what you've promised me,
Prince Yongping.

417
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,280
I won't let Father down.

418
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,680
There is no indication
of the location in this place.

419
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,199
Why don't we split up?

420
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,800
After we find the right way,

421
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,000
we'll return to notify each other.

422
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,239
That'll work.

423
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,599
-Run!
-Hurry!

424
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,000
Run now!

425
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,119
Hurry!

426
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,880
Watch out! Over here!

427
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:25,640
Careful!

428
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,160
-Master.
-Father.

429
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,719
Are you all right?

430
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,800
I'm fine.

431
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,599
It's not safe to stay here anymore.

432
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:30,959
Follow me!

433
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:31,640
Let's go!

434
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,280
Come on!

435
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,199
Go!

436
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,280
-Move!
-Hurry!

437
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,760
Wang Minghai had been captured?

438
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:52,920
Yes.

439
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,800
His Lordship gave the order

440
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,359
at the Ministry of War today.

441
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,520
He's now locked up in the dungeon.

442
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,400
Minister Wang has also entered
the palace.

443
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
I think he went to meet the Queen.

444
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,719
Do we have anyone
we can use in the dungeon?

445
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,479
Yes.

446
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,920
Kill Wang Minghai.

447
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,000
But Wang Minghai is
Minister Wang's younger brother.

448
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,040
Besides, the Queen hasn't decided

449
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,719
what to do yet.

450
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:27,800
I've said this before.

451
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,760
You work for me.

452
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:32,599
So you only listen to my orders.

453
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,640
Have you forgotten about that?

454
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,479
I dare not.

455
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,599
I'll do as you say.

456
00:22:44,707 --> 00:22:48,809
(Yongzhou Army Base)

457
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,959
Report, Marquis Xun'an.
Someone wants to see you.

458
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,520
But he comes
with Prince Yongping's official tablet.

459
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,119
Let him in.

460
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:01,640
Yes.

461
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:07,280
Ren Chuanyu greets Marquis Xun'an.

462
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,920
What brings you here?

463
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,079
I came here under the order

464
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,680
of Prince Yongping

465
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,199
to return your horses.

466
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,359
Return my horses?

467
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,920
I don't understand what you're saying.

468
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:24,280
I was in the eastern frontier
to purchase horses

469
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,599
and accidentally found out
someone was selling military horses.

470
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,839
Do you know the crime is heavier
to smuggle military horses

471
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:32,520
during the war?

472
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,560
Are you trying to frame me?

473
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,040
I dare not.

474
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,319
But military horses are registered

475
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:48,199
like the soldiers.

476
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:51,000
We'll know who smuggled
the horses after the investigation.

477
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,839
The horses were in the eastern frontier.

478
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:54,719
If His Lordship finds out,

479
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,680
I think he'll first investigate
this camp.

480
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,479
But Prince Yongping has said

481
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,280
that you're his uncle.

482
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,199
He won't make it difficult for you.

483
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,680
If these horses aren't yours,

484
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,800
take them as a gift
from Prince Yongping.

485
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,959
We indeed lack military horses.

486
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:13,760
If Prince Yongping is willing
to give me 1,000 military horses,

487
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,359
I'd naturally accept them.

488
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,079
His Highness has
another message for you.

489
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,359
He said he missed eating

490
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,199
the dumplings his uncle made for him.

491
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,599
He'd like to have some
if there's a chance.

492
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,599
Tell Lanxi.

493
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,880
He can come and see me anytime
if he wants some dumplings.

494
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:37,920
Thank you, Marquis Xun'an.

495
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,880
I'll definitely convey
your message to him.

496
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:49,119
(Lanxi is a better strategist.)

497
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,599
(The moment I accepted his favor,)

498
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,560
(the winner of this game
had already been decided.)

499
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:00,760
Come! Hurry up!

500
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,839
Thank you, Prince Huang.

501
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,319
If you weren't here,

502
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:10,520
I think a lot of us

503
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,119
would have died in there.

504
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,719
Master Bai, you're too kind.

505
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,800
I'm sure the earthquake is unexpected.

506
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,719
But we can only depend on ourselves

507
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,239
now that we're trapped here.

508
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm worried about the aftershock.

509
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,079
There is an open space ahead.

510
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,239
Let's head that way first.

511
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:25,719
All right.

512
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,479
Master,

513
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:37,520
Yu Wuyuan destroyed
the mechanism hub in the mountain,

514
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,040
which caused an earthquake.

515
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:43,040
Go and check.

516
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,680
Repair the formation

517
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,640
and lure Yu Wuyuan

518
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,599
to Yangui Array.

519
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,000
What did you say?

520
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:55,800
We heard the news from the dungeon

521
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,760
that Second Master
had committed suicide.

522
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,079
One can

523
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,680
sum up Minghai with one word,

524
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,359
which is "greed".

525
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,920
Someone greedy is afraid to die.

526
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,640
Why would he commit suicide
in the dungeon?

527
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Are you saying

528
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:19,839
Second Master was murdered?

529
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,280
I'll investigate this right away.

530
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,920
No need.

531
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,599
No one

532
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,760
would have done this if not

533
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,839
for that person in the palace.

534
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,239
Do you mean the Queen?

535
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,160
But didn't she say
she would find a solution

536
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,359
to save Second Master

537
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,199
when you met her today?

538
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:35,319
Her words

539
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,359
can't be trusted at all.

540
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,959
After staying in the palace
for many years,

541
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:44,040
she's the best at being a hypocrite.

542
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,880
Compared with Minghai,

543
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,479
she cares more

544
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,400
about her son.

545
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,959
She's worried we'll betray her son

546
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,560
to save Minghai.

547
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,680
So...

548
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,479
I'll never forget

549
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
about this.

550
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:12,520
Your Highness,

551
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,719
we heard the news from the dungeon

552
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,599
that Wang Minghai had killed himself.

553
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,719
Killed himself?

554
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,199
Do you hear anything
from Prince Ju's side?

555
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,599
From Li Jiaxian's words,

556
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,479
I don't think Prince Ju did it.

557
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,160
It wasn't Ju?

558
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,479
Then who did it?

559
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:29,040
One more thing,

560
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,239
there's a message
from the relay station.

561
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,479
They saw a caravan from the
eastern frontier transporting horses

562
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,439
to the capital of Yongzhou.

563
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,160
It should be the military horses
Prince Yongping prepared for His Lordship.

564
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,920
If Prince Yongping succeeds
in this task,

565
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:44,479
he will move closer to becoming
the heir of Lord of Yongzhou.

566
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,560
Get some men

567
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,640
to rob the horses.

568
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,880
I'll do it right away.

569
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,959
Ren Chuanyu has sent his words.

570
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,479
These are

571
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,359
the intelligence gathered
by Fountain Abode.

572
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:08,239
Didn't I say

573
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,800
no need to deliver news from Mount Wu?

574
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,160
The news of Mount Wu
this time isn't related

575
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,479
to Miss Feng.

576
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,760
There was suddenly

577
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,760
an earthquake nearby Mount Wu.

578
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,359
The villages around it were destroyed.

579
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,319
There were also landslides in Mount Wu.

580
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,719
What about those in Mount Wu?

581
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:24,239
No one was seen leaving Mount Wu
at the moment.

582
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,239
It was a violent earthquake.

583
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,479
I fear

584
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:30,119
those people were buried in Mount Wu.

585
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,199
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

586
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,599
Your Highness,
Chuanyu delivered a message.

587
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,959
He said the first batch of horses
could be transported today.

588
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:46,640
But these days,

589
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,079
messages from Fountain Abode stated

590
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,479
that several horse bandits
suddenly gathered.

591
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,079
They're likely to target our caravan.

592
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:53,479
All right.

593
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,359
Make no mistake
about the military horses.

594
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:57,079
I'll take care
of this matter personally.

595
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,359
Gather those from Fountain Abode

596
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,760
and prepare to reinforce
Chuanyu and the rest.

597
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
I'll go along with them.

598
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,199
Yes, Your Highness.

599
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,160
Your Highness?

600
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,199
Count the horses

601
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,760
and transport them
to the Ministry of War right away.

602
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,079
Yes, Your Highness.

603
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,479
I have other matters to take care of.

604
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,839
Return to the capital for now.

605
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,920
If anyone asks you of me,

606
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,800
tell them I went to the eastern frontier

607
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,959
to transport the rest of the horses.

608
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,160
The rest?

609
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:13,920
Your Highness,

610
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:15,959
isn't the eastern frontier
the other way?

611
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,439
Gyrfalcon?

612
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,640
Hold on to me!

613
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:03,959
How could this be?

614
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:14,199
No one in the valley is hurt.

615
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,119
Yu Wuyuan has been lured
to the Yangui Array.

616
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,599
All right.

617
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,280
Master,

618
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,239
Yangui Array is a dead end.

619
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,959
Why did you send Yu Wuyuan there?

620
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,760
He wanted to trap Bai Fengxi in the cave

621
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,599
because of the Sacred Jade Moon.

622
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:37,520
He has

623
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,839
such a ruthless heart.

624
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,680
That was close.

625
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,479
Luckily, I found you in time

626
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,439
after gyrfalcon found you.

627
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,280
Otherwise, I couldn't find you

628
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,599
after the mountain collapsed.

629
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,760
Why did you come to Mount Wu
out of a sudden?

630
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,599
If I didn't come,

631
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,199
you would end up at the bottom
of the mountain.

632
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
But with your skills,

633
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,239
how did you end up in the valley?

634
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,800
I was with Mr. Yu

635
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,439
when we came across

636
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:08,560
the cave maze set up by Old Taiyin.

637
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,520
I didn't expect there'd be
an earthquake.

638
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:15,800
So you were with Yu Wuyuan

639
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,839
for the past several days.

640
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,760
Yes.

641
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,079
We were traveling together.

642
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,439
Mount Wu is shrouded in mist.

643
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:30,000
It's naturally better to have company.

644
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,479
Since I'm here,

645
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,079
I'll take care of you.

646
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:35,599
Get some proper rest.

647
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,359
Tomorrow, I'd like to see

648
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,439
how great Old Taiyin is.

649
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,560
Try my cooking.

650
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,839
Why are you so careless?

651
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:00,920
Let me do it.

652
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,239
Black Foxy,

653
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,159
it's a pity if you don't open
a restaurant

654
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,320
with this cooking skill.

655
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,520
Not everyone is

656
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,760
as fortunate as you.

657
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,360
Why aren't you eating?

658
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,679
I'm not hungry.

659
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,000
I picked this myself.

660
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,360
I picked it myself.

661
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,959
This is the only one
in this deep mountain.

662
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,320
Just keep it for yourself.

663
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:49,080
I want you to try it.

664
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,280
It's good.

665
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,520
There's a cave ahead.

666
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:35,959
I think it's the path in front of us.

667
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,239
This is the Liuyao Array
of King Lanling.

668
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,479
If we want to break the formation,

669
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,280
we must find the hinge.

670
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,760
We must

671
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,719
be careful.

672
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
I'll deal with this formation.

673
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,120
Watch out!

674
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,080
Master,

675
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,479
Bai Fengxi and a man
have entered Liuyao Array.

676
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,719
That man

677
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,479
should be Hei Fengxi.

678
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,159
I wonder if those two

679
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,080
can figure out my true meaning.

680
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:27,760
Every stone brick on the ground

681
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,239
has hidden mechanisms.

682
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,120
We can't force our way in.
We need to use our wit.

683
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,560
To break the formation,

684
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,639
we must understand

685
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,080
the connections

686
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,080
between these stone bricks
and the statue.

687
00:37:37,117 --> 00:37:38,280
(Wisdom)

688
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,345
(Righteousness)

689
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,243
(Benevolence Loyalty Filial Piety)

690
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,120
The words on the ground are

691
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,000
the eight virtues.

692
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,520
I remember seeing

693
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,320
these seven Lord statues

694
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:50,000
in Dadong Eight Pagoda a long time ago.

695
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,399
There's a poem for every Lord.

696
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:58,040
Lord Huangwu.

697
00:37:58,047 --> 00:37:58,519
(Lord Huangwu)

698
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:58,959
Faith.

699
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,600
Words agree with the meanings.

700
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,719
Lord Fengsu.

701
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,290
A skillful man works hard.

702
00:38:03,295 --> 00:38:03,653
(Lord Fengsu)

703
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:05,120
A wise man worries.

704
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,456
(Wisdom)

705
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:09,958
(Faith)

706
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:13,560
Then Lord Huangwu represents faith.

707
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:16,639
Lord Fengsu represents wisdom.

708
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,120
As for the rest of the words,

709
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,959
we should be able to break the formation

710
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,560
as long as we find the statues

711
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,959
and drive the right words
into the slot of the lotus seat

712
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,800
under the statues.

713
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,959
Let's give it a try.

714
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:50,800
Lord Shangrui.

715
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:51,679
(Lord Shangrui)
Manners make the man.

716
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,719
Manners make the man.

717
00:38:53,188 --> 00:38:54,188
(Etiquette)

718
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,000
Lord Beiwen.

719
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,855
(Lord Beiwen)
With sincere loyalty,

720
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:57,879
(Loyalty)
a mighty spirit fills the world.

721
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,959
Lord Huakang.

722
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,039
Find the answers to all.

723
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:00,679
(Lord Huakang)
Find the answers to all.

724
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,840
Value righteousness over gold.

725
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,160
(Righteousness)

726
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:02,840
Lord Fengzhao.

727
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,920
(Lord Fengzhao)
Filial piety is a priority.

728
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,439
Filial piety is a priority.

729
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:04,880
(Filial Piety)

730
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,040
Emperor of Dadong.

731
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,000
Benevolent people are

732
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,840
people-centered.

733
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,988
(Benevolence)
people-centered.

734
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,679
Old Taiyin really cares

735
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:12,679
about the world.

736
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,560
He hopes everyone in the world

737
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:16,000
can follow

738
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,800
these eight virtues.

739
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:11,879
Black Foxy,

740
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,520
I think we did it.

741
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,879
Old Taiyin hopes

742
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,479
that everyone lives peacefully,

743
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,760
and is benevolent and filial.

744
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,439
Who's there?

745
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:27,760
Are you Old Taiyin?

746
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,600
Yes.

747
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm the disciple
of the Tianshuang Sect, Bai Fengxi.

748
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,919
My Master is stranded on Mount Wu.

749
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:38,239
So I had no choice but to come here.

750
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,919
I hope Old Taiyin can forgive me.

751
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,719
What about you,

752
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:43,560
the man in black?

753
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,399
I'm Hei Fengxi of The Fountain Abode.

754
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:47,080
Greetings, Old Taiyin.

755
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,479
Hei-Bai Fengxi,

756
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,719
you're indeed extraordinary

757
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:54,479
for breaking the Liuyao Array.

758
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,000
I'll remember you two.

759
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,360
But

760
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,280
if you want to obtain
the Sacred Jade Moon,

761
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,479
you're still far from it.

762
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:05,239
Old Taiyin,

763
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,479
can you tell me

764
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:07,760
where my Master is?

765
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,600
Is he safe?

766
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,360
He's safe for now.

767
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:14,679
But if you want to save them,

768
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,399
you have to master the Sacred Jade Moon.

769
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:22,040
Anyone who has received my invitation

770
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,199
and has entered Mount Wu

771
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:27,120
must undergo my tests.

772
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,239
Next,

773
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,479
it'll be up to your fate.

774
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,360
Let's go.

775
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,479
With the two of us working together,

776
00:41:57,919 --> 00:41:59,199
it'll be a stroll

777
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:01,040
even if it's the 18th level of hell.

778
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,919
I also want to see

779
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,239
what Old Taiyin looks like.
