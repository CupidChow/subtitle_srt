Zhong Li.

21
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:45,199
Show Prince Xieyue to his room.

22
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,480
Yes.

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,199
Come with me, Prince Xieyue.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,720
Care for a stroll?

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,919
I'll pass.

26
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,480
I'll be in my room.

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,000
Thank you for your help today.

28
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,520
You have good taste.

29
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:22,960
That, I always do.

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,679
I already took a glimpse

31
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,000
at his dam project.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,399
It's quite thorough.

33
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,279
Also, now that we're in Liangcheng,

34
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:30,479
we can adapt the project
to the local needs.

35
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,720
Using the mess Yu Ming left behind,

36
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,800
we can reduce the time needed
for the dam construction.

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,839
He can be quite cunning

38
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:40,199
but he does hold his subjects dearly.

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,559
He's

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,520
a wise ruler like you.

41
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,039
I'm not talking about this.

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
I came here for two reasons.

43
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,320
One, for the peace talk.

44
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,639
And the other

45
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,800
is to see how serious

46
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,240
Feng Lanxi treats you.

47
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,800
When we were conversing,

48
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,759
I took many glances at you

49
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,080
and he noticed it.

50
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,639
That shows he really likes you.

51
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,839
Only when you're into someone,

52
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,679
you will pay attention
to him or her closely.

53
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:13,240
You'll hate to miss out on any details.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,919
I'm just worried

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,679
that he would notice something's off

56
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,639
and figure out your identity.

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,679
He's smart in everything

58
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,880
except

59
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:25,320
for that.

60
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:29,160
Because he can view other things

61
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,880
objectively

62
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,160
but he can only

63
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,639
think about you

64
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,320
whenever he sees you.

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,520
Prince Yongping has arrived!

66
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,399
Why is he here?

67
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,600
Hide yourself.

68
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,679
Greetings, Prince Lanxi.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,320
Have you gotten all acclimatized,
Prince Xieyue?

70
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,559
Do you need anything?

71
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,839
All is well.

72
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,039
Did you come here

73
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,360
looking for more clarifications?

74
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,119
During our meeting just now,

75
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,399
I noticed that you had been staring

76
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:10,279
at the court lady.

77
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,759
Keen observation, Prince Lanxi.

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,960
I admit.

79
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,040
That court lady

80
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,839
looks like an old friend of mine.

81
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,799
I was taken aback

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,160
and thus, behaved inadequately.

83
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,880
Please forgive me.

84
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,040
However, she is just a court lady.

85
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,959
Why the intervention in person?

86
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,760
I'm here to warn you

87
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,040
not to have any wrong idea about her.

88
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,480
I do wish to have her serve me instead.

89
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600
Would you do me this honor,
Prince Lanxi?

90
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,600
And I thought you were a classy man.

91
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,679
Your platitude is quite disappointing.

92
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,679
Can you explain,

93
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,480
Prince Lanxi?

94
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,320
First of all,

95
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,320
she is not my subordinate.

96
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,959
She is my partner.

97
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,920
I am lucky to have met her.

98
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,399
She doesn't belong to anyone

99
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:00,559
except to herself.

100
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,519
Secondly,

101
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,559
all men have their free will.

102
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,839
No one should be
traded away like goods.

103
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:07,600
Noted.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,679
However,

105
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,720
if she has her own free will,

106
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,959
should she develop feelings towards me,

107
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,519
will you let her leave?

108
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,000
If she does harbor feelings towards you,

109
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,359
I will not intervene.

110
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,799
My sister, Xiyun,

111
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,279
is also an unrivaled beauty.

112
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,200
All men want to have a look at her.

113
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,279
Is that court lady

114
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,079
better than Xiyun in your eyes?

115
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,679
If Xiyun harbors feelings toward you,

116
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,760
who will you choose?

117
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,239
In my heart,

118
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,040
she is one of a kind.

119
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,359
No one holds a candle to her.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,119
Why all these questions?

121
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
During our encounter today,

122
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,040
I used your loved one to test you.

123
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,720
It seems like all the rumors about you

124
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,519
didn't do you justice.

125
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,640
You do not speak from the high horse.

126
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,640
You view everyone as equal.

127
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,640
You care about your loved one

128
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,959
and the people.

129
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:21,720
Your heart is one
with freedom and generosity.

130
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,640
You are testing me?

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,920
Why?

132
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,359
I have my own reason.

133
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,640
One day,

134
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,920
you'll see it.

135
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,600
Farewell, Prince Lanxi.

136
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,519
Your taste

137
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,600
is better than I imagined.

138
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,399
See you.

139
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,679
Buns!

140
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:09,359
Big and steamy buns!

141
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,359
Black Foxy.

142
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,119
Don't you want to take a stroll with me?

143
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,119
I'm free now.

144
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,119
Let's take a stroll together.

145
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,119
When you're busy, you toss me aside.

146
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,799
When you're free, you come to me.

147
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,959
That doesn't reflect well on me.

148
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:23,920
It sure

149
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,359
doesn't.

150
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,040
In that case,

151
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,079
I'll go back then.

152
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,480
Wait.

153
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,679
Since you implore me
to take a stroll with you,

154
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,119
I guess I can still hand out
this bit of kindness.

155
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:38,799
Excuse me.

156
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,200
All right.

157
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,760
Buns!

158
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:46,880
Look at Liangcheng.

159
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:48,279
What has changed?

160
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,480
It's getting livelier.

161
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,119
There are more smiling faces.

162
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,920
All

163
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:01,600
thanks to you.

164
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,880
(Buns)
Yu Ming

165
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,519
(Buns)
was their oppressor.

166
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,000
And you got rid of him for them.

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,519
A compliment from you?

168
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,959
My trip here is worth it then.

169
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,559
I should thank you.

170
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,239
If you want

171
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,000
to protect all the people,

172
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,399
you have to be in politics.

173
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,959
The small feuds
in the martial arts world

174
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,440
can only save a few people.

175
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,799
One day,

176
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,400
I wish to see

177
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,159
a peaceful and harmonious world.

178
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,080
If you can keep doing this,

179
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,359
I will always be by your side

180
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,840
and help you.

181
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,719
Thank you for your assistance then,
Heroine Fengxi.

182
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:08,640
What a sudden spring rain.

183
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,000
After this rain,
the freshet will arrive soon.

184
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,640
Wait for me.

185
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,558
(Umbrella)

186
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,719
Mister, two umbrellas, please.

187
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Unfortunately, Mister,

188
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:23,080
I only have one left.

189
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,599
(It seems like)

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,159
(a rainy day isn't all that bad.)

191
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,358
♪The scenery is so picturesque,
painting a picture of the mortal coil♪

192
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,919
This umbrella is so small.

193
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,640
Don't get soaked.

194
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,440
The people here are counting on you.

195
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,799
I have an idea.

196
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,760
♪Yet the beauty of your eyes
cannot be matched♪

197
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:56,165
♪The chaos of this land

198
00:09:57,118 --> 00:10:02,285
♪The glow in your eyes lights up my day♪

199
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:08,141
♪Whether in memories forgotten,
or uncertainties of future♪

200
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:15,375
♪With your hand in mine,

201
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:22,525
♪Even with the love forsaken,
the right and wrong obsessions♪

202
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:29,920
♪The glow in your eyes lights up my day♪

203
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,280
You are a man of your words,
Prince Xieyue.

204
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,239
I do not joke around

205
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,760
when the prospect
of my subjects is involved.

206
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,359
I hope it is the same for you.

207
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,280
Of course.

208
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,479
I didn't

209
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,359
come to Liangcheng

210
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,640
to meet the fool of a governor, Yu Ming.

211
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,479
Once the water canals are done,

212
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,080
Liangcheng will prosper.

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,479
Once the canals are connected
to the waterway,

214
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,520
before long,

215
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,640
Liangcheng will be the center

216
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,039
that leads to everywhere.

217
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,719
And then,

218
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,400
maritime routes will be established,

219
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,159
bringing in free trade.

220
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,359
Most importantly,

221
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,080
the rich mineral source
from the upstream

222
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,640
will be accessible to Liangcheng.

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,239
You know me very well, Prince Xieyue.

224
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,960
This is your government plan.

225
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:26,039
Why would you involve me

226
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,880
in such an important matter?

227
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,440
I want us to work together.

228
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,760
Don't worry, Prince Lanxi.

229
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,880
Qingzhou

230
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,400
will be your best ally.

231
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,061
(Jizhou)

232
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,400
Father, you're awake.

233
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,400
Are you still unwell?

234
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,119
My son.

235
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,359
Come.

236
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,039
Lift me up.

237
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,359
You have stayed by my side
the whole night.

238
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
I appreciate it.

239
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,760
I failed to protect you

240
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,320
and let harm come to you.

241
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,159
Please punish me accordingly.

242
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,520
You saved me in time.
You are guilty of nothing.

243
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,200
Get up now.

244
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,599
What is happening?

245
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,840
Father,

246
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,280
please read this.

247
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,840
(They failed to harm the heir, so they
switched their target to His Lordship.)

248
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,890
(They framed me for the crime)

249
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:22,870
(so that I will be ousted
and they can install a new Lord.)

250
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:25,400
Is...

251
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,039
Is this true?

252
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,479
I couldn't believe it at first.

253
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:32,440
They are the ministers of Jizhou.

254
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,119
Why would they want
to poison their Lord?

255
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,159
However, it is a serious allegation

256
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,599
so I conducted a thorough investigation.

257
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,000
None was spared.

258
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,200
That's how I got this clue.

259
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,520
Solid evidence

260
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,679
in black and white.

261
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,559
As the government ministers,

262
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,119
they forgo their mission
to serve the society

263
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,919
and instead scheme

264
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,200
to sow discord between you and me.

265
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,479
This is unforgivable.

266
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,719
But they have served me

267
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,320
for more than 20 years.

268
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,880
(From, your son, Huang Chao)
They are like my brothers!

269
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,640
Why would they betray me so?

270
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,799
I have become old.

271
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,159
Sorry for accusing you.

272
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,679
However, this incident

273
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,679
has made us communicate more frankly.

274
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,359
You wish to enforce justice in the world

275
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,880
and to unite the Six States.

276
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,640
And so,

277
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,640
our nation shouldn't be a burden to you.

278
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,119
This is not a bad thing.

279
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,440
Please get up.

280
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:36,799
Thanks, father.

281
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,799
Once you get rid of those people for me,

282
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,799
a bright path awaits you.

283
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,719
You care about your nation

284
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,400
and you're aided by Yu Wuyuan.

285
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,119
You will rule the world sooner or later.

286
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,719
I just hope that when that day comes,

287
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,000
you will rule with kindness.

288
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,679
If you conquer to feed your thirst

289
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,359
for power,

290
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,479
then you're a tyrant,

291
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,000
not a ruler.

292
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,000
Well noted, Father.

293
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:15,440
I let Yu Wuyuan be my advisor

294
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,320
because I know

295
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,440
he cares deeply about the world.

296
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,000
He is not a cruel person.

297
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,479
With his assistance,

298
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,119
I will not let all commoners down.

299
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,799
What you have to do is justified

300
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,080
but people will talk.

301
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,719
I will issue a public apology

302
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:41,159
and tell everyone how you helped me

303
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,159
to eliminate the unscrupulous ministers
as well as your wise leadership.

304
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:47,599
I will seal the mouth of those

305
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,640
good-for-nothing ministers.

306
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,599
But please, do not forget

307
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,440
your promise today.

308
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:00,440
Of course.

309
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,119
Thank you, Father.

310
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,760
Young Master,

311
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,960
as expected,

312
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,559
Lord of Jizhou has issued an apology.

313
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,400
Jizhou now belongs to Huang Chao.

314
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,200
Knowing him,

315
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,359
he will turn that place anew.

316
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,640
I also have news from the Imperial City.

317
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,119
Bai Jiande was there

318
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,640
but our people couldn't stop him.

319
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,320
I don't know what he found out.

320
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,599
I will deal with it myself.

321
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,520
Any news about Feng Lanxi?

322
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,760
Feng Lanxi arrived in Liangcheng

323
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,000
and ousted
the military commissioner, Yu Ming.

324
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,799
And then, he had a peace talk
with Prince Xieyue.

325
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:38,119
Qingzhou has now withdrawn its army.

326
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,640
Feng Lanxi will stay in Liangcheng
for the dam project.

327
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,719
I knew he is a talented man.

328
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,719
If we can't get rid of him soon,

329
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,520
he'll be a nuisance to our plan.

330
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,159
Help Feng Ju in secret

331
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,200
in the capital of Yongzhou.

332
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,840
I will arrange for it now.

333
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:52,440
Also,

334
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,599
give me the intel on Youzhou.

335
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,919
After this incident,

336
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,440
Huang Chao will head to Youzhou
for a marriage proposal.

337
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,000
The change

338
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,599
might start with Youzhou.

339
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:04,160
Noted.

340
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,800
Wuyuan, are you here?

341
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,520
Why did you dress up so, Your Highness?

342
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,959
After we parted ways,

343
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,199
I asked Huang Chao to find a way

344
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,239
to let me join the military

345
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,800
and follow General Qiu Jiushuang.

346
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,479
But why?

347
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,599
I just want to help Huang Chao.

348
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,040
Besides, General Qiu is female.

349
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,760
Bai Fengxi is a heroine.

350
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,479
Why can't I do the same then?

351
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,800
Indeed, women can do what men do.

352
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,839
Wuyuan,

353
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:40,439
I won't let you down.

354
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:42,520
I still have to go
to the training ground.

355
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,079
See you then.

356
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,760
Huang Chao!

357
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:58,119
My sister really likes you.

358
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,000
She knows we are after the world

359
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,160
so she volunteered to be enlisted.

360
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:05,040
She has endured all the hardship alone.

361
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,839
But you know the fate of my family.

362
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,599
Why didn't you stop her?

363
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,920
You know her temper.

364
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,319
The thing in Jizhou has ended.

365
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,199
I'm heading to Youzhou.

366
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,880
Will you join me?

367
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,239
I have packed my luggage.

368
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,239
Your Highness,

369
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,640
after we posted the recruitment notice,

370
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,640
only less than a hundred men signed up.

371
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,000
It's not enough

372
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,199
to construct the dam in time.

373
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,400
Did you include everything
in the notice?

374
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,959
I tell the truth, Your Highness.

375
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,560
I wrote what you asked me to.

376
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,199
Eight hours of work per day.

377
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,839
Twenty wen per working day.

378
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,959
One free meal.

379
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,199
The recruitment is not compulsory.

380
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,439
Everyone can sign up if they want to.

381
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,680
In my opinion,

382
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,119
it's the last line

383
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,839
that gave them the entitlement.

384
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,319
Your Highness,

385
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,719
the commoners are foolish.

386
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,079
If you want to use them,

387
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,520
giving a reward is not enough.

388
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,160
We should roughhouse them a bit.

389
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,520
What you said, General,

390
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,040
makes me understand

391
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:03,160
why no one signs up.

392
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:04,479
I'll bring some people with me tomorrow

393
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,959
and drag them to the dam.

394
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:06,800
I'll force them to work half a day.

395
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,520
Nonsense!

396
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,119
I'm telling you.

397
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,839
Not many signed up

398
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,800
because they lost their trust
in the government.

399
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,520
They do not trust you

400
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,040
so they will not sign up.

401
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:22,880
As long as I'm still here,

402
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,640
do not let me hear

403
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,599
what you said just now again.

404
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,079
Apologies, Your Highness.

405
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,520
Your Highness.

406
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,760
I have an idea.

407
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,199
Many

408
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:35,680
did not sign up

409
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:36,839
for another reason.

410
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,839
The lack of food supply.

411
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,400
Even if they are paid,

412
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,040
they still can't use the money
to buy food.

413
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,800
Money is then worthless for them.

414
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:46,800
I propose

415
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,880
that we establish
a food relief program first.

416
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,959
Once everyone can feed themselves,

417
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,680
they will sign up.

418
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,959
It is a good idea.

419
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:56,839
However, Your Highness,

420
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,680
our food supply is running low.

421
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,359
We might not have enough

422
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
for a food relief program.

423
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:06,800
Let them work for food then.

424
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,239
Gather the people to build the dam.

425
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Their salary will be converted to food

426
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:12,560
according to the market price.

427
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,560
Also,

428
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:14,920
inform the capital of Yongzhou.

429
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,239
Ask them to find a way

430
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,160
to send some food.

431
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,160
Noted.

432
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:21,880
Dismissed.

433
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,680
Yes, Your Highness.

434
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,160
Why the frown?

435
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,760
You already know it's a problem.

436
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,040
Why do you want to hear it?

437
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,479
What if

438
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,400
you join me

439
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,000
and we frown together?

440
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,560
What if it's only a problem for you

441
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,760
but not for me?

442
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,319
Just tell me.

443
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,160
All right.

444
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,880
What do you think of it?

445
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,040
To regain their trust,

446
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,920
compensating the people
is almost crucial.

447
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,239
Yu Ming

448
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:12,479
exploited the people,
refused to pay the workers,

449
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,079
and added unnecessary taxes.

450
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,400
Those already destroyed
all the trust people had.

451
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,760
The money Yu Ming embezzled

452
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,000
all went to the treasury, didn't it?

453
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,520
In that case,

454
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,160
giving it back to the people

455
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,680
can regain their trust.

456
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,560
It's not that
I haven't thought about it.

457
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,040
However, money is an enticing demon.

458
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,359
If you hand out money like that,

459
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,800
crimes might happen in the city.

460
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,479
Also, those old financial records

461
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,119
cannot be traced back clearly as well.

462
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,280
It will

463
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,920
only make the people distrust us more.

464
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,880
I didn't ask you
to give them the money directly.

465
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,520
What do you mean?

466
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:45,319
Have some people

467
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,160
divide the money into smaller slices

468
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,359
and bury them under the water canals.

469
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,520
Then, spread the rumors

470
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,680
that

471
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,160
the money Yu Ming embezzled

472
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,160
is all hidden under the water canals.

473
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,599
That might work.

474
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,359
If they dig out the money,

475
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,479
they will receive a small windfall.

476
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:04,239
When they think about how
they were exploited by Yu Ming,

477
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,160
they will want to make up
for their losses

478
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,640
so they will sign up.

479
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,359
I can

480
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,680
give this a try.

481
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,319
How exhausting.

482
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,400
When will this dam project ever end?

483
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,800
If it weren't for the food,

484
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,760
I wouldn't work here.

485
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,680
Stop complaining. Just work.

486
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,160
My family still needs to eat.

487
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,319
All right.

488
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,479
Silver coins!

489
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,040
Show me.

490
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,680
- Silver coins!
- Let me see.

491
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,680
There are more.

492
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,319
Hurry up.

493
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,719
Dig up.

494
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,359
Hurry up.

495
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,359
There are more!

496
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,680
There are silver coins!

497
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,640
There are more! Hurry up!

498
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,119
Hurry.

499
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:55,680
Silver coins!

500
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,880
Have you heard?

501
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,359
Wang in the east of the city
went to build the dam.

502
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,920
He found silver coins
from the water canals.

503
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,560
Impossible!

504
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:03,920
Seriously?

505
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,400
Why are there silver coins
in the water canals?

506
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,000
Exactly.

507
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,400
I heard
that the corrupted official, Yu Ming,

508
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,160
hid his money in the canals.

509
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,160
I have to sign up then.

510
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,680
I need to find the money

511
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,760
he took away from me.

512
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:15,640
I will too.

513
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,920
Let's go.

514
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,040
Your strategy is an effective one.

515
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,079
Of course.

516
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,040
To thank you,

517
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,599
let me cook dinner for you.

518
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,119
Are you sure?

519
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,359
No, I'm not.

520
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,520
Black Foxy.

521
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,560
Black Foxy,
you said you would cook for me.

522
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,079
No taking it back.

523
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,439
When did I say that?

524
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:40,239
Black Foxy!

525
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,439
You said you would cook!

526
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,680
All right. Line up, please.

527
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,599
Line up.

528
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,359
No need to push.

529
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,160
Everyone will be recruited.

530
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,079
Here. Give me a hand.

531
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:52,760
Come.

532
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,359
Go.

533
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,079
Come. When I count to three,

534
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,920
we'll carry this together.

535
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,599
Careful.

536
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,079
One, two, three. One, two, three.

537
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,920
One, two, three.

538
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,319
Come on.

539
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:04,599
Keep doing it.

540
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,599
Now!

541
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,839
All right. There are many vacancies.

542
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,920
Everyone will be recruited.

543
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,319
Go carry the sacks.

544
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,119
Okay.

545
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,839
I have investigated it

546
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:19,000
per your request, Your Lordship.

547
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,160
Please have a look.

548
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,560
House of Jade did take part

549
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,000
in some illegal trades.

550
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,160
And

551
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:29,000
many serving ministers are implicated.

552
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,520
I do not yet know

553
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,119
its purpose.

554
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,319
However, I have reasons

555
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,719
to believe

556
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,160
that they are scouring intel
for Fountain Abode.

557
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,599
It will then sell the intel.

558
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:47,239
Zhongge, in your opinion,

559
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,839
have they planted anyone around me?

560
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,199
I

561
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,079
do not know.

562
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,000
However, Your Lordship,

563
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,040
Fountain Abode is a very discreet party.

564
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,680
My investigation

565
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,000
did not reveal much about them.

566
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,880
To be able to achieve this...

567
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,000
Its mastermind

568
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,160
cannot be underestimated.

569
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,520
If they do plan to overthrow you,

570
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:14,920
we have to be extra careful.

571
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,119
Hei Fengxi.

572
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:18,479
Feng.

573
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,479
Do you think

574
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,800
the mastermind is a descendant
of the royal family?

575
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,680
If he is from the royal family,

576
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,119
then...

577
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,520
We already have a lead
on Fountain Abode.

578
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,839
Now, get to the bottom of it.

579
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,239
Go

580
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,439
and capture House of Jade's shopkeeper
in secret.

581
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,800
Interrogate him

582
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:44,040
and see if we can find out
who Hei Fengxi is.

583
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,199
Yes, Your Lordship.

584
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,839
Your Lordship, news from Liangcheng.

585
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:04,680
Yuan Lu.

586
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,040
This son of mine is quite talented.

587
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,560
Yesterday,

588
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,280
I received flash news from Liangcheng.

589
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,239
Liangcheng Military Commissioner,
Yu Ming,

590
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,040
was found embezzling the people's money.

591
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,880
He tried to take over the city
and ruled it himself.

592
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:25,280
Prince Yongping has killed him.

593
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,520
Then,

594
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,479
Prince Yongping had a peace talk
with Prince Xieyue of Qingzhou.

595
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,560
Qingzhou has withdrawn its army.

596
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,079
As expected from Prince Yongping,
a descendant of the royal family.

597
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,920
He is an educated and wise leader.

598
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,239
Your Lordship,

599
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,760
I believe

600
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,920
we should invite Prince Yongping
back here to reward him.

601
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,959
I concur.

602
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,479
I concur.

603
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,599
I concur too.

604
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,520
Liangcheng is a remote place.

605
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,239
Prince Yongping
shouldn't stay there for long.

606
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,280
As the Minister
of Civil Service Affairs,

607
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,040
I will nominate

608
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,239
a new military commissioner

609
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,520
as soon as possible.

610
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,719
No need, Minister Feng.

611
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,920
Your Lordship,

612
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,520
I have a nominee.

613
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,959
Vice Minister of War, Liu Zhong.

614
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,560
Prime Minister,

615
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,000
this is not a trivial matter.

616
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,000
Liangcheng is a remote city.

617
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,920
After the bad precedence
which is Yu Ming,

618
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,319
the new military commissioner

619
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,400
should be carefully selected.

620
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,239
All right.

621
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,359
Before Prince Yongping left,

622
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,719
he mentioned

623
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,239
that he wanted to build a dam.

624
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,880
Let him govern

625
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:31,880
Liangcheng for now.

626
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,719
Of course,
he will be rewarded handsomely.

627
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,800
Make an announcement.

628
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,800
Another 3,000 households
will be given to Prince Yongping.

629
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,239
He is also authorized to use
half the royal carriage.

630
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,880
Yes, Your Lordship.

631
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,439
Your Highness,

632
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,400
His Lordship gave half the royal carriage
to Prince Yongping.

633
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,479
What should we do now?

634
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,520
Find someone

635
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,640
to spread his feats in Liangcheng

636
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,920
far and wide.

637
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,760
History has shown that all rulers

638
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,520
hate to have their thunder
stolen by someone else.

639
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:03,839
If everyone knows

640
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,000
that the Liangcheng
Father could never tame

641
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:08,319
was tamed by Feng Lanxi,

642
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,280
Father will think otherwise.

643
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,800
As for his rewards today...

644
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,239
Didn't you notice?

645
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:13,640
Having more lands
and access to the royal carriage

646
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,959
serve nothing.

647
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,760
Father did not grant him more money
or more soldiers.

648
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,040
I see.

649
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,239
You want to make him grow complacent.

650
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,239
Go.

651
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,760
Make sure everyone sings his praises.

652
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:25,839
Yes, Your Highness.

653
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,880
Two weeks have gone by

654
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,079
and the dam is almost connected.

655
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,959
Once it's connected, we can build
the cofferdam and the sluice gate.

656
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,439
Chuanyun and Chuanyu did a great job.

657
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,239
I have to make sure
their contribution is rewarded.

658
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,160
Also,

659
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:44,599
commoners in Liangcheng

660
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,520
contributed to this cause too.

661
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,400
The scene of everyone

662
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,280
working together like this

663
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,599
reminds me of the peaceful times
depicted in the novels.

664
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:55,040
You read novels too?

665
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,839
What else do they mention?

666
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,280
The sign of a peaceful time

667
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,119
is when the people are treated
more highly than the ruler.

668
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:05,760
You are full of surprises.

669
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:08,479
It's like the closer I am to you,

670
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,319
the less I know about you.

671
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,280
When will I

672
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,079
be able to understand you completely?

673
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:18,680
I have seen many things
in the martial arts world.

674
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,319
Unfortunately, everyone

675
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,239
shares the same fate in this world.

676
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,560
No matter how hard you work,

677
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,359
your journey won't be a smooth one.

678
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:30,040
Now that every State
is eyeing more power,

679
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,839
the people will have to suffer

680
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,640
soon enough.

681
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,400
If you want all of them

682
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,199
to live happily,

683
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,439
you need to avoid conflicts.

684
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:44,239
If all States within the Dadong Empire
can put the people

685
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,719
above themselves,

686
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,520
there will be no war.

687
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:57,400
Greetings, Your Highness.
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

688
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,319
Great job, everyone.

689
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,239
Thanks, Your Highness.

690
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,400
Thanks, Your Ladyship.

691
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,680
One, two. Lift.

692
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,719
One, two. Lift.

693
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,119
Lift!

694
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,959
One, two. Lift.

695
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,719
Pull!

696
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,800
One, two. Lift.

697
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,119
Keep it up!

698
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,640
One, two. Lift.

699
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,640
Steady.

700
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,680
Steady, everyone.

701
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:42,479
Keep it up.

702
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,000
Come.

703
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,800
Lift.

704
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,439
All right.

705
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:53,880
Continue.

706
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,520
Good.

707
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,079
Steady.

708
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,079
Go, help them!

709
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,800
Pull!

710
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:28,520
One, two, three. Pull!

One, two, three. Pull!

One, two, three. Pull!

713
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:45,920
Pull!

714
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,400
Hurry!

715
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:58,280
Keep it up!

For our work today, Liangcheng

733
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:54,640
Why are you panicking, Chancellor Ren?

734
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,800
Did something grave happen?

735
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,199
Something bad happened to House of Jade.

736
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,160
What?

737
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,040
I received news this morning

738
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,359
that everyone from House of Jade
went missing.

739
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,560
Something's amiss.

740
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:06,520
House of Jade is related
to Fountain Abode.

741
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,359
I have people follow the incident

742
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,839
and I found out
that the entire House of Jade is empty.

743
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,839
Not even a sheet of paper was left.

744
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,560
It's almost as if it's never occupied.

745
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,040
All within a night?

746
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:19,319
How can this be?

747
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,839
House of Jade holds the clue
to His Highness' identity.

748
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,319
Our enemy

749
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,359
has expended a huge effort
to pull this off.

750
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,479
He must be an important figure.

751
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:30,479
Now that we're unclear about everything

752
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,079
and they are in the dark,
we have to be careful.

753
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:34,000
Chancellor Ren,

754
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:35,239
it's an emergency.

755
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,920
Send someone to Liangcheng

756
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,839
to inform His Highness.

757
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,400
I will check the Royal Palace.

758
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,280
And I will check the martial arts world.

759
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,520
We'll split here.

760
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,479
Okay.

761
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,217
(Liangcheng, Yongzhou)
Your Highness,

762
00:33:46,218 --> 00:33:47,359
now that the dam is connected,

763
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,920
the rest of the construction
is carried out successfully.

764
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,319
Judging from the current progression,

765
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:53,000
the water canals will be done
in a month or so.

766
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,439
You have left many years
of legacy here, Your Highness.

767
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,319
How is the food supply?

768
00:33:58,199 --> 00:33:59,079
Fret not.

769
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:01,119
Extra food supply has arrived.

770
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:02,280
We have plenty of food.

771
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,040
Good.

772
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,079
Chuanyu,

773
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,479
what about the Moyu Cavalry?

774
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,159
Chuanyun incorporated Liangcheng Army

775
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,239
into the Moyu Cavalry.

776
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,560
We have

777
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,760
five thousand men now.

778
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,399
Five thousand.

779
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,199
Still lacking.

780
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,239
Before I arrived in Liangcheng,

781
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,199
I heard that there were bandits
outside of the city.

782
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:27,719
Is this still true?

783
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,280
Yes.

784
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,800
I tried to chase them away

785
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:35,000
but those bandits are elusive.

786
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,239
They also hide in the mountains

787
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,080
so I can never uproot all of them.

788
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,560
Those bandits steal and rob.

789
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
If they can sneak out
of Liangcheng Army's searches,

790
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:49,000
it means they must have a close tie

791
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,040
with Yu Ming.

792
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,639
I...

793
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:54,719
Or perhaps, they are very close

794
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,719
to certain generals.

795
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,040
Your Highness,

796
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:01,120
I have nothing to do with it.

797
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,159
Yu Ming

798
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:03,840
colluded with the bandits.

799
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Please right my name, Your Highness.

800
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,360
Do you know

801
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:09,639
the relationship between them then?

802
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,120
I have some information.

803
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:21,600
Get up.

804
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:22,879
Thanks, Your Highness.

805
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,439
I'll assign you this task.

806
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,560
Go to the nearby mountains
and gather the bandits.

807
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:31,280
If they are willing
to turn over a new leaf

808
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,959
and join the Moyu Cavalry
to defend Liangcheng,

809
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:34,560
they will be pardoned.

810
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:36,159
Yes, Your Highness.

811
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:37,760
Chuanyu.

812
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:40,399
Chuanyun and you will bring
the Moyu Cavalry along.

813
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,479
Our purpose is to recruit soldiers.

814
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,479
If there are people

815
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,800
who are hellbent on committing crimes,

816
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,320
you can exercise laws on the spot.

817
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:50,959
Yes, Your Highness.

818
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:53,879
Dismissed.

819
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,080
I will take my leave.

820
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,479
Where is Fengxi?

821
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,000
Miss Fengxi left the Protectorate
this morning.

822
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,399
On a medical trip, she said.

823
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,520
A medical trip?

824
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,040
She can't sit still at all.

825
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:18,560
Let's check it out.

826
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,600
I heard the female physician here

827
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,080
is the consort of His Highness.

828
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:27,040
Really?

829
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,600
What's the matter, Mister?

830
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:32,600
Your Ladyship,

831
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:34,600
can you give me some ointment?

832
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,840
What for?

833
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,600
I twisted my ankle

834
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,080
when I was transporting the food.

835
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,639
You can't do that.

836
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:45,879
You are a noble person.

837
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:46,639
Don't mind it.

838
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,199
Here.

839
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,919
Does it hurt?

840
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,479
Yes, this place here.

841
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,479
Mister, you're fine.

842
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:00,520
I'll give you a prescription

843
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,120
and you just need to get some medicine
for physical exertion.

844
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,439
But where can I get the medicine from?

845
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,840
Do you have a financial problem, Madam?

846
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,000
I can pay for your first.

847
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,280
You have no idea.

848
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:10,479
All apothecaries in the city
have been shut down.

849
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,239
The sick can only let their ailment

850
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
heal itself.

851
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,560
There is not

852
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,800
a single apothecary in the city?

853
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,040
Not at all.

854
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,000
- I have some medicine.
- I...

855
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:22,560
Thanks, Your Highness.

856
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,840
At ease now.

857
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:24,959
Thanks, Your Highness.

858
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:25,840
Get up.

859
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,760
Thanks, Your Highness.

860
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,760
Thanks, Your Highness.

861
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,879
I came to Liangcheng

862
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,080
with some medicine too.

863
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,760
If you need medicine,

864
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,879
bring your prescription
to the Protectorate.

865
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,280
Everything has been arranged.

866
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,000
Wonderful.

867
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:41,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

868
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,040
Go get your medicine.

869
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,879
Okay. Thank you so much.

870
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,879
Thanks, Your Highness.

871
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,679
The rest of you

872
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,439
can consult me too.

873
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:51,800
What?

874
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,360
You can heal too, Your Highness?

875
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,080
I...

876
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,000
You don't trust me?

877
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,399
My medical knowledge

878
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:59,000
might be superior to hers.

879
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:01,800
Excuse me?

880
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,520
Don't make a bold claim.

881
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,239
Fancy a competition

882
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,760
to see who can save more lives?

883
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,159
Bring it on.

884
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:07,879
Okay.

885
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,320
Whoever comes to me for the consultation

886
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,399
will receive an extra dou of rice.

887
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,280
Careful.

888
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,159
Line up, please.
