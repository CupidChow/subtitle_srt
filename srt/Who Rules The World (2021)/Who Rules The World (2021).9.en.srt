=Episode 9=

20
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,440
The mastermind
of this plot is Wang Yuan.

21
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,480
Feng Ju knows of Wang Yuan's treachery.

22
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,440
He likes taking credits.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,760
He takes risks if it's necessary.

24
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,080
That's why he keeps Wang Yuan
by his side.

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,000
With Feng Ju's wits,

26
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,760
he can absolve himself of everything

27
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:02,440
even if Father learns the truth.

28
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:04,680
My younger brother is treacherous.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,040
He may seem reliant on Baili,

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
but if I can put up an act,

31
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,960
so can he.

32
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,559
My dear Feng Ju

33
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,360
must not be underestimated.

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,000
But even so,

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,600
Your Highness was able
to see through his plot, wasn't it?

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,039
It is fortunate

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,960
to have you come to my aid

38
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,559
when I am in bleak times.

39
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,199
It is my utmost honor

40
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,000
to have Your Highness
put so much faith in me.

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,880
After all, the Feng family

42
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,839
helps only the future ruler.

43
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,520
Naturally,
we do everything we can to serve them.

44
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:52,759
Are you just
that confident in me, Minister Feng?

45
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,475
Your Highness is well-equipped

46
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,440
with military, strategy,
and tactical expertise.

47
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,039
Who else

48
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,759
but Your Highness may seize that throne?

49
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,600
I had failed

50
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,479
to recognize a true talent
when we first met.

51
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,679
I shan't

52
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,479
repeat that mistake.

53
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,399
After this incident,

54
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,119
might the Feng family

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
have the honor of serving Your Highness
as your arms and limbs?

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,399
Isn't

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,759
the Feng family already?

58
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,199
What will your next step be,
Your Highness?

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
I survived a great catastrophe.

60
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,160
It's time I see my father again.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,399
My son, Lanxi,

62
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,759
was born by my first queen.

63
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,279
He is sophisticated, poised,

64
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,080
refined, and intelligent.

65
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,639
An unfortunate accident

66
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,679
led him to fall into the waters.

67
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,519
We have searched for days,
but we have yet to find anything.

68
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:17,959
I...

69
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,040
am devastated.

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,679
May our ancestors in the heavens

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,440
guide my son to return safely.

72
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,239
He had just led the men
to repair the Lianjiang Levee,

73
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,559
and he just...

74
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,920
It's no wonder they say
the good don't live long.

75
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:39,600
Indeed.

76
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,519
My brother is in distress.

77
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
My heart suffers so.

78
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,480
I would like to donate

79
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,200
100,000 dan of rice as my father did

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,799
to pray for my second brother.

81
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,600
Prince Ju is so kind and caring.

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,480
Indeed.

83
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,119
He is the only Prince who came today.

84
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:00,959
I heard

85
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:03,600
Prince Chang was raised
by the late queen herself.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,399
But I don't see him anywhere.

87
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,519
Report!

88
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,839
Your Lordship.

89
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:10,839
What is it?

90
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,320
Speak!

91
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,160
Prince Lanxi's body has been found.

92
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,720
Father.

93
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,279
Bring the body.

94
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,119
Yes.

95
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,239
Bring the body!

96
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,640
Your Lordship.

97
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,519
It is better for you not to see this.

98
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,480
His body is barely recognizable anymore.

99
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,200
Your Lordship.

100
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,239
Your Lordship.

101
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,880
Prince Lanxi
has returned to his residence.

102
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,440
What did you say?

103
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,079
Prince Lanxi
has returned to his residence.

104
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,640
You mean Xi is still alive?

105
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:30,480
His Highness is blessed
by the heavens and deities.

106
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,559
He was saved by the fishermen

107
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,239
after he was swept away by the waters.

108
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
Our men were able
to locate His Highness.

109
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,760
His Highness
has returned to his residence now.

110
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,480
I will go to see him at once.

111
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,320
Understood.

112
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,959
Find out who this is

113
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,359
and what this is all about!

114
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,935
(Stellar Talent)

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,720
Your Highness.

116
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,359
The severe pathogenic cold
in your body has yet to be fully cured.

117
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,000
You will still need
to consume medicine.

118
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,640
Thank you, Administrative Assistant.

119
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,320
Please come with me
to write the prescription.

120
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:08,839
Thank you for your hard work.

121
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,160
I shall excuse myself now.

122
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,440
His Lordship has arrived.

123
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,640
Greetings, Father.

124
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,160
Get up quickly.

125
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,839
How is your body?

126
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,440
Are you all right?

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,040
The physician has said

128
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,040
that it was just coldness.

129
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,480
It's nothing serious.

130
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,399
I've made you worry.

131
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,040
Nonsense.

132
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,620
You are my son.

133
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,000
Of course, I would worry about you.

134
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,920
You don't look so well.

135
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,119
This is what we'll do.

136
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,559
I'll leave the physician
at your residence

137
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,440
to look after your health.

138
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,640
Thank you, Father.

139
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,320
You had suffered

140
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,079
for the sake of the people.

141
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,160
I will reward you well.

142
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,799
Thank you, Father.

143
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,399
I hope you will be fair

144
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,559
in rewarding
and punishing those deserving.

145
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,720
I will find

146
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:28,959
the persons who harmed you

147
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:31,320
and ensure they are severely punished.

148
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,880
Do you know who might have done it?

149
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
I have some leads.

150
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,919
Tell me.

151
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,840
I've just returned
from a close shave with death.

152
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,520
I do not wish to be known
as one who harms his own sibling.

153
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,400
Who do your leads point to?

154
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,799
My little brother,

155
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:57,880
Feng Ju.

156
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,960
It looks like

157
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,239
you've been busy
after you were swept away.

158
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:11,760
Do you have any respect or care
for your father?

159
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,359
Please forgive me, Father.

160
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,960
Do you know how worried I was?

161
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,080
Your first thought

162
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,960
after you were saved
was not to inform me.

163
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,640
Instead, you were busy thinking
of how to deal with your brother.

164
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,359
Do you know

165
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,760
that this alone

166
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,679
is enough for me
to punish you for deceiving your lord?

167
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:31,239
I know what I did wrong.

168
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,239
But I ask you

169
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,359
to punish Ju
for attempting to murder a prince

170
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,479
as well, Father.

171
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,679
Are you forcing me right now?

172
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,320
You are forcing me

173
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,679
to punish two of my sons at once!

174
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,799
You know

175
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,960
that I am not

176
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,599
trying to frame or slander
my brother by doing so.

177
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,760
As long as I keep investigating,

178
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,719
I will find the proof.

179
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:00,880
Father.

180
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,119
We are father and son,
but also subject and lord.

181
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,760
Above our relations

182
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,799
are the laws

183
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,440
of the family and the nation.

184
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,159
Laws of the family and the nation.

185
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,880
Stay in your residence
and focus on recovering.

186
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,320
I will give you an explanation.

187
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:34,679
(One of Ju's aides
attempted to harm Xi.)

188
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,080
(Ju might not have been aware,)

189
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:38,960
(but he still has
to be held accountable.)

190
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:42,440
(It's only right that Xi)

191
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,679
(talked to me in that manner.)

192
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:46,960
(I haven't treated Xi well
over these years.)

193
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,919
(But if this matter is pursued,)

194
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:52,479
(my sons will turn against each other.)

195
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:55,359
(My family will no longer be peaceful.
That is not a sight I wish to see.)

196
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:57,039
Yuan Lu.

197
00:10:58,599 --> 00:10:59,080
Yes, Your Lordship.

198
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,119
Prepare two decrees for me.

199
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,200
Yes, Your Lordship.

200
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,080
You've taken care of things in my stead

201
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,880
while I was away
from the capital of Yongzhou, Master.

202
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,719
You've worked hard.

203
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,239
It is my blessing

204
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,799
to see Your Highness return safely.

205
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:14,919
What's more,
given what Your Highness did today,

206
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,440
I believe Prince Ju
will be in hot water.

207
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,320
I merely turned his scheme against him.

208
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,760
Prince Ju's trivial tricks

209
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,359
mean nothing before

210
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,479
Your Highness' witty plans.

211
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,200
Oh, right. Have the members
of the Tianshuang Sect settled in yet?

212
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,479
Yes.

213
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,320
Is the Tianshuang Sect in Yongzhou?

214
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:37,119
I was saved, all thanks to Bai Fengxi.

215
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,520
Otherwise,

216
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,039
you may never see me again.

217
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,039
No.

218
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,880
We can't let them keep investigating.

219
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,440
At this rate,

220
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,520
they'll find out it was our doing.

221
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,559
It's time to answer Father.

222
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,840
It was my idea.

223
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,200
Your Highness had nothing to do with it.

224
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,640
I will bear

225
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:09,960
all the consequences.

226
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:12,599
I have sent a letter
to Her Highness by pigeon.

227
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:19,760
Got it.

228
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,440
Leave.

229
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,359
"My second son, Prince Lanxi,
has made a safe return.

230
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,159
I am most glad.

231
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,960
I hereby grant him
the title of Prince Yongping.

232
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,159
He will be allowed
to establish his own office

233
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,919
and oversee Jincheng
and Dangcheng remotely.

234
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,599
He will also be granted 5,000 servants.

235
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:01,239
Additionally, Ren Chuanyun shall be
appointed as General of Agile Cavalry

236
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,119
and take charge of the Qinglin Army.

237
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,960
Ren Chuanyu shall be appointed
as Commandant Guoyong.

238
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,359
That is all."

239
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,280
Thank you, Your Lordship.

240
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,919
His Lordship has asked me to deliver

241
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,239
another message to Your Highness.

242
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
His Lordship said,

243
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,719
"Between a subject and his lord,
the law of the nation is paramount.

244
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,960
Between a father, son, and brother,

245
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:38,080
family comes first.

246
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,080
May Prince Yongping
remember those words always."

247
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,840
I've remembered them.

248
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,000
I shall excuse myself now.

249
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:56,200
(Tolerant and Unbiased)

250
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,159
Move.

251
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,811
(Temple at Mount Ning, Yongzhou)

252
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:28,039
I can tell that you're in turmoil
from the sound of the wooden fish.

253
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,440
Mother.

254
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:32,761
(Queen of Yongzhou, Baili)

255
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,239
Mother, I have missed you so.

256
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:43,599
Do you know what you did wrong?

257
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,640
I was unable to protect Wang Yuan.

258
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,000
He was one of your old attendants.

259
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,840
You had him
stay by my side to assist me.

260
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:52,359
But he died because of me.

261
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,960
Wang Yuan is but a servant.

262
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:58,080
It is only right
for a servant to die for his master.

263
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,440
Your mistake

264
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,239
was running here and hiding
in the mountains

265
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,119
to pray the minute
Feng Lanxi returned in one piece.

266
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,640
Why not just

267
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:12,039
carve the word "guilty"
on your forehead?

268
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,000
What did I tell you

269
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:17,479
before I left the capital?

270
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,039
You said you would come
to Mount Ning to pray.

271
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:22,320
On the surface,
you came here to pray for Father,

272
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,280
but actually, you are secretly meeting

273
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,119
with my uncle,
Marquis Xun'an, who is stationed

274
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:26,880
at the eastern frontier.

275
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,840
If Uncle Ning could support us,

276
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,840
I'd have the highest chances of becoming
the heir of Lord of Yongzhou.

277
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,119
You also told me to plan
and manage well in the capital

278
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,119
and not to cause any trouble.

279
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,440
Did you do as I said then?

280
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:50,840
I have worked so hard
to secure your uncle's support

281
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:53,400
for you here at Mount Ning.

282
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:55,840
And yet,
I haven't even left the mountain,

283
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,840
and I am being told

284
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,960
that Feng Lanxi
was granted the title of Prince Yongping.

285
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,359
I was wrong, Mother.

286
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,799
I fell for Feng Lanxi's schemes.

287
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:09,479
Feng Lanxi hid his capabilities
and pretended to be a meek lamb

288
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,479
for over ten years. He even fooled me.

289
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,880
You are indeed no match

290
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,359
for his cunningness.

291
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:18,799
Yes.

292
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,919
I know you are discontent.

293
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,359
But you must admit defeat
when it is due.

294
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,719
Admitting defeat

295
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,119
is easier than facing death.

296
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:33,880
Your father only took Wang Yuan's life.

297
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,159
That means you still have a chance.

298
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,320
If you lose, figure out how to win.

299
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,200
What I want

300
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,440
is not for you
to just win against Feng Lanxi.

301
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,320
I want you

302
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,840
to sit

303
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,119
on the throne
your father sits on someday.

304
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,320
I understand.

305
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,679
Wang Yuan is dead.

306
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,520
You need others to assist you.

307
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,840
I do have a few candidates.

308
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:03,799
How good can you be at reading people?

309
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,400
I have someone
named Li Jiaxian that serves me.

310
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,880
He is more careful
and meticulous than Wang Yuan.

311
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,760
Keep him by your side.

312
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,160
Thank you, Mother.

313
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,000
I am at a loss

314
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,760
without you, Mother.

315
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:23,239
It is only right
for a mother to plan for her child.

316
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,280
I've finished with my matters here.

317
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,239
Go and get ready.

318
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
I shall be returning.

319
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,959
May you be blessed
with health and fortune, Mother.

320
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,800
I shall leave now, Mother.

321
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:49,286
(Qingyin Monastery)

322
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,119
(Feng Ju's aide, Li Jiaxian)
I, Li Jiaxian, greet Your Highness.

323
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,280
Mother has told me about it.

324
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,239
From now on, you will serve me.

325
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,319
Understood.

326
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,960
(Qingyin Monastery)

327
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,359
You did well.

328
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,040
I sent you to her side

329
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,599
in hopes that one day

330
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,880
you would return to me.

331
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,760
I should actually
thank Feng Lanxi for this.

332
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,680
I couldn't have gotten rid
of Wang Yuan without him.

333
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,119
From now on,

334
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:16,160
I finally have
one of my own aides by my side.

335
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,479
Everything I do is for Your Highness.

336
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,040
You must have questions.

337
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,839
She is my birth mother.

338
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,040
She loves and cares for me.

339
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,239
Why would I do such a thing to her?

340
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,839
I dare not wonder, Your Highness.

341
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,880
I obey your every command,
Your Highness.

342
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,239
I've never thought about it.

343
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,880
It's not that you haven't.

344
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:33,920
It's because you dare not.

345
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,040
I said you are one of my own.

346
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,520
As such,
there are things you should know.

347
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,079
This is my sincerity.

348
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:41,760
Your Highness, thank you
for your trust in me.

349
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,400
My mother plans and plots for me.

350
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,520
For the title of the heir
of Lord of Yongzhou.

351
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,359
But my father is in his prime.

352
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,439
So what if I become

353
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,560
the heir of Lord of Yongzhou?

354
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,000
The power wouldn't be in my hands.

355
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,160
It would only go to my mother.

356
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,760
In the end,

357
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,680
I'm just a puppet.

358
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,359
Your Highness, these words...

359
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:00,920
What?

360
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,880
Should I not say them?

361
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Or do you dare not hear them?

362
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:07,319
It's fine if you don't want to.
You can turn around and leave.

363
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,359
But what leaves shall be a dead body.

364
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,160
I'm all ears, Your Highness.

365
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,079
Do you know

366
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,680
why my father didn't actually punish me

367
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,359
even though I dealt with Lanxi?

368
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,000
It's because His Lordship
favors Your Highness more.

369
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,640
You're wrong.

370
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,560
It's because my father only sees me

371
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,040
as a good-for-nothing

372
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,160
who only obeys my mother.

373
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,560
Your Highness,
you mustn't think that of yourself.

374
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,160
Enough.

375
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,680
I don't need you to flatter me.

376
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,079
In fact, I happen to like it this way.

377
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,400
Not just my father.

378
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,760
I hope the entire world
sees me that way.

379
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,520
That would please me.

380
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,319
So not only will I keep this up,

381
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
but I will behave even more peevishly.

382
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,040
Only then

383
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,920
will Lanxi
show his true colors.

384
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,400
Only then

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,839
will my father turn his animosity

386
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,560
to him.

387
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,680
Your Highness, you intend to let them fight
and reap the spoils from it?

388
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,400
Yes.

389
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,239
That's why the more
Lanxi shows off his skills,

390
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,040
the happier I am.

391
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:09,800
You know what I want now, don't you?

392
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:12,640
I am at your disposal, Your Highness.

393
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,544
(Dadong)

394
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,719
How is the plan coming along?

395
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,400
It is as that man said.

396
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,046
(Crown Prince of Dadong, Jing Yan)
The Six States

397
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:27,119
(Crown Prince of Dadong, Jing Yan)
are fighting for the Empyrean Token.

398
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,415
(Emperor of Dadong, Emperor Chunxi)
They won't have the time

399
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,560
(Emperor of Dadong, Emperor Chunxi)
or energy to bother with us right now.

400
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,280
Besides,

401
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,400
one of the three fake tokens

402
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,000
has fallen

403
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,359
into the hands of the heir of Lord
of Jizhou, Huang Chao, as he said.

404
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,520
Jizhou and Yongzhou
are the two strongest states.

405
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,119
This matter has allowed us
to weaken Jizhou as well.

406
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,280
It is a great fortune
for Imperial Family.

407
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,280
So

408
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,000
now you know

409
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,199
what that man is capable of.

410
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,239
I am deeply impressed.

411
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,400
Your Majesty.

412
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:00,800
Your Majesty.

413
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,359
An urgent report from Jizhou.

414
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,760
Bring it here.

415
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,456
(From Huang Chao,
the heir of Lord of Jizhou:)

416
00:21:09,457 --> 00:21:10,694
(We have recovered the Empyrean Token
and will escort it to Imperial City)

417
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,560
What a good move.

418
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,880
Jizhou is actually going
to return the Empyrean Token.

419
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,400
What is the meaning of this?

420
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,880
Father, what should we do now?

421
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,479
What else can we do?

422
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,560
I will issue a decree
summoning the Six States

423
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,959
to come to the palace
for a banquet to celebrate

424
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:41,560
and thank Jizhou
for returning the token.

425
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,239
I

426
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:45,079
shall greet them myself.

427
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,280
Yes.

428
00:21:55,638 --> 00:21:59,201
(The Capital of Yongzhou)

429
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,847
(The Capital of Yongzhou)

430
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:07,599
Chang?

431
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,479
You've returned so soon.

432
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:14,079
You must have had a tiring journey.

433
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,319
I heard you went to Mount Ning.

434
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,079
Chanting prayers
and knocking the wooden fish.

435
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,479
You must've had a harder time.

436
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,280
You don't know yet, do you, Chang?

437
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,199
A few days ago,
Father granted Lanxi the title

438
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,199
of Prince Yongping.

439
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,119
He is the only one

440
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,880
with that title among us.

441
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,079
We will have to bow and greet him

442
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,400
when we see him now.

443
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm fine with that.

444
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,079
But you've always wanted

445
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,880
to be ahead of things, Chang.

446
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,439
I'm sure you must have
a hard time accepting this.

447
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,359
Why would I?

448
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,800
Lanxi is my younger brother.

449
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,599
The noblest blood

450
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,280
of Dadong's Imperial Family
runs within him.

451
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
That alone

452
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,760
is enough to make me
accept coming second

453
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,479
to him in everything.

454
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,040
Accept?

455
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:01,239
He has been safe and sound already.

456
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,719
But he refused to show up.

457
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,640
Leaving you there trying
to find him in the rain and sun,

458
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,880
without a single message.

459
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:10,199
You regard him as a brother.

460
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,439
But does he treat you like one?

461
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:21,923
(The Capital of Yongzhou)

462
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:32,884
(Prince Yongping's Residence)

463
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,760
Your Highness.

464
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:37,933
(Prince Yongping's Residence)

465
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,389
(Prince Yongping's Residence)

466
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,000
Chang.

467
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,239
Greetings, Prince Yongping.

468
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,640
Chang.

469
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:19,959
My health is already frail.

470
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,680
You would shorten my life by doing this.

471
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,400
Oh, you're worried
about a shorter lifespan now, huh?

472
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,359
Why weren't you worried
about that when you left me

473
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,280
to look for you by the river?

474
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,199
Feng Ju said that,

475
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,760
didn't he?

476
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,160
You know him well.

477
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:42,839
But he doesn't know us at all.

478
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,160
But he doesn't know us at all.

479
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,119
Easy there, Chang.

480
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,839
I was in the water for days.

481
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,119
You must've had a hard time.

482
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,239
If I hadn't been lucky,

483
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,760
you might not be seeing me now.

484
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:07,479
My Lanxi
is blessed and fortunate.

485
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,239
Chang, let's sit and talk.

486
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,319
I heard our father
sentenced Wang Yuan to death.

487
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,359
He's just a servant.

488
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,920
Father bestowed you a title.

489
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:25,920
You mustn't pursue
the matter any further.

490
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,839
If not, Father might...

491
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,239
I understand.

492
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:37,359
You may have
made it out safely this time,

493
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,239
but you and Feng Ju have also
shed all pretenses of cordiality.

494
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,079
You must be careful.

495
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:44,239
I met him at the city gate today.

496
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,959
He was returning from Mount Ning.

497
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,079
That means she knows as well.

498
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,040
It won't be long before she gets back.

499
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
You must take precautions.

500
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,800
I will do so.

501
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,680
You are good in many ways.

502
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,760
But you keep too much to yourself.

503
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,319
You're smarter than Feng Ju,

504
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,239
but you must
take good care of your health.

505
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,079
Overthinking and worrying too much

506
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,160
is bad for your health.

507
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,119
If you really want to compete with him,

508
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,400
you must make sure
you take care of your body.

509
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,239
Thank you for your concern, Chang.

510
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,239
I will be more mindful.

511
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:20,400
All right.

512
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,520
I'm relieved
to see that you're all right.

513
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,400
You've had a long journey. Rest well.

514
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,760
I'll return to my residence now.

515
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,560
You've always worried about
and cared for me.

516
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,199
I am truly grateful.

517
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,359
I ordered Chuanyu to prepare a gift

518
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,520
and deliver it to your residence

519
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,280
as a token of my appreciation.

520
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,719
Don't worry, Chang.

521
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,079
No matter what happens,

522
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:50,880
I will always be the younger brother
that grew up with you.

523
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:16,760
Martial Sister.

524
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,839
Gu Yu asked for another silver leaf.

525
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,400
But we don't have much left,

526
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,040
so I didn't give it to him.

527
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,599
He got angry and ran out.

528
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,319
It's fine.

529
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:26,560
Gu Yu won't go anywhere he shouldn't.

530
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,760
If he asks for more money next time,

531
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,119
give it to him.

532
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:32,439
I'll think of something
to get more money.

533
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,280
Understood.

534
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:38,560
Mr. Fengxi.

535
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:45,280
Why are you here?

536
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,719
I own this residence.

537
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:48,959
Why can't I be here?

538
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,400
You do look like a noble young man
all dressed up like this.

539
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,319
It took me by surprise at first.

540
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:56,959
But

541
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,280
that mean-spiritedness of yours is back.

542
00:27:59,280 --> 00:27:59,920
That must mean

543
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,800
things went well
with your family affairs.

544
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,119
It was all right.

545
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,199
How are you guys?

546
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,640
Have you gotten used to the place?

547
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,800
Langhua's condition has been stabilized.

548
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,599
The physician says
she should wake up in a few days.

549
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,199
This residence
is very comfortable as well.

550
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:14,920
Everyone enjoys it here, right?

551
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,319
- Yes.
- Yes.

552
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,280
So

553
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
I still have to thank you.

554
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:24,119
Just a "thank you" again.

555
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,880
What else do you want then?

556
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,239
Go out with me.

557
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:29,520
Consider it payback.

558
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,239
I still need to cook for them.

559
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,560
- And...
- The seasons change.

560
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:36,359
They won't stop because you aren't here.

561
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,520
Don't worry.

562
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,160
I've already sent Zhong Li

563
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,439
to order food from Lanyun Restaurant.

564
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,079
He will stay here to help too.

565
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,479
You don't have an excuse

566
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,479
to turn our Young Master down today.

567
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,400
Martial Sister,

568
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,560
you should go.

569
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,959
We'll take care of things here.

570
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:57,839
Nothing will happen.

571
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:58,719
Isn't that right?

572
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,400
- Yes.
- Go on.

573
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:03,599
Fine.

574
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,599
I'll accompany you then. Reluctantly.

575
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:07,479
Let's go.

576
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,599
Yongzhou is indeed the greatest.

577
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,760
It's the best of the cities I've seen.

578
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,040
Even the people on the road

579
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,160
are so relaxed and carefree.

580
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,439
I hope this state of Yongzhou

581
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
will never be ruined.

582
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,520
I hope so too.

583
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,280
You asked me to come out with you today.

584
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,439
Is there something on your mind?

585
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,560
I have an older brother.

586
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,000
He treats me very well.

587
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,400
But I am hiding things from him.

588
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:44,800
Have you ever plotted against him?

589
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,439
Of course not.

590
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:51,280
In that case,

591
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,400
it's easy.

592
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,920
You deceived him.

593
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,640
It's normal that he would be upset.

594
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:58,280
All you have to do is talk to him
and untie the knot in his heart.

595
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,680
When I was younger,

596
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,479
I often tricked my brother
into helping me copy essays too.

597
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,319
He would chase after me
and try to hit me,

598
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,680
but he was never really mad.

599
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:05,079
Since you guys are brothers,

600
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
you should talk to him

601
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,640
and try to solve what's bothering him

602
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,800
if you feel bad.

603
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,520
Don't move.

604
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,119
What happened?

605
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,479
I just saw an acquaintance.

606
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:25,680
I don't want her to recognize me.

607
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,920
Don't look back.

608
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,800
That back of that man looks familiar.

609
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,839
It looks like Prince Lanxi.

610
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:37,439
Prince Lanxi wouldn't
hold hands with a girl in the street.

611
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,560
You must've been mistaken.

612
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,400
I finally know

613
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,680
why you want me

614
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,520
to come out with you as repayment.

615
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,319
You can shop longer
than most young ladies.

616
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,359
We've already been out here
for half a day.

617
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
Don't you feel tired at all?

618
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:55,920
What?

619
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:58,520
Is a candied hawthorn skewer
not enough to keep your mouth busy?

620
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,439
Wait.

621
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,359
You were born in Yongzhou.

622
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,839
You should be used to all of this now.

623
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:08,000
I just like how lively it is here.

624
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,160
That has nothing to do

625
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,640
with you at all.

626
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,079
(But it's my first time here)

627
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,040
(with you.)

628
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,839
What a beautiful sea of flowers.

629
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,280
Miss,

630
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,000
our Second Prince designed this himself.

631
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,520
His Highness' name is Lanxi.

632
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,119
This sea of flowers is composed
of various kinds of flowers.

633
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,760
They only bloom during this time.

634
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,520
The Gentry of Elegance
of The Four Gentry

635
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,319
is plain and tasteful indeed.

636
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:48,959
Am I not tasteful?

637
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,479
Do you know what's missing between you

638
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,319
and Mr. Lanxi?

639
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,280
It's just the character "Lan".

640
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,239
A character makes a world of difference.

641
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:03,839
"A promise as long-lasting and
unchanging as the fragrance of orchids.

642
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:06,000
May one's heart be
as faithful as the flower."

643
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:08,239
A single character
makes a huge difference.

644
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,920
But I heard Mr. Lanxi
doesn't have good health.

645
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,560
I hope he isn't like these orchids.

646
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,640
Miss, these flowers
may only bloom for a short time,

647
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:19,920
but my art

648
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,439
can preserve the beauty
of the flowers and you forever.

649
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,640
Really?

650
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,680
Yes.

651
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,520
All right. Please paint a picture of me.

652
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:30,439
All right.

653
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:45,719
Wait.

654
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:48,680
I'll do it.

655
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,439

Your painting skills

677
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,959
put mine to shame, Sir.

678
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:40,040
What do you think?

679
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,719
I was born with good looks, of course.

680
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,399
Not that I draw well?

681
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:44,919
It's all the same.

682
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,719
- Give it to me.
- Give it to me.

683
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,080
It's over there.

684
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,600
Thank you, Miss!

685
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,320
Thank you, Miss.

686
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,959
Don't mention it.

687
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
He must be scared.

688
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,560
You should bring him back now.

689
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,919
Thank you.

690
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Don't cry.

691
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,919
What's wrong?

692
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,360
I think I twisted my ankle.

693
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,320
I'm fine.

694
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,320
Come on. Let's go back.

695
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,000
Sit down and let me take a look.

696
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:31,879
Don't move.

697
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,000
Bear with it.

698
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:44,800
Try to move it.

699
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,760
It's a lot better now.

700
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,840
Don't be a hero if you can't do it.

701
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,760
I wasn't incapable.

702
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,000
Everyone can be careless...

703
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,520
You shouldn't use that foot too much.

704
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,080
Come on.

705
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,879
I'll carry you back.

706
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,080
You will carry me?

707
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:12,080
What else?

708
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:13,320
Dilly-dallying

709
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,080
will only waste time.

710
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:17,080
Do you think I'm so free?

711
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,959
Martial Sister? Martial Sister.

712
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:45,080
- Sir.
- Martial Sister.

713
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:46,320
What happened?

714
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,479
Sir.

715
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,239
I just twisted my ankle. I'm fine.

716
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,719
Sir, we should head back now.

717
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,879
I'll be leaving then.

718
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,919
Wait.

719
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,360
The painting.

720
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,080
Just a painting.

721
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,719
A painting?

722
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,360
Go on.

723
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,439
I'm off.

724
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,199
Come on.

725
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:06,840
I can walk.

726
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,080
Two days ago,

727
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:11,600
we received news that Queen Baili
was returning to the palace.

728
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,600
She must've been made
aware of what happened to Your Highness

729
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,320
and couldn't sit idly by anymore.

730
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:18,479
Take appropriate measures
as the situation calls for.

731
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:21,959
My intention was to get her to return.

732
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,959
I'll see what she has up her sleeve.

733
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:27,800
Let's wait and see
before making any moves.

734
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,080
Are you concerned, Official Feng?

735
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,879
Queen Baili is guileful and resourceful.

736
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,840
When we greet her tomorrow,

737
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,840
she may try to harm Your Highness.

738
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,080
I will not

739
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:41,600
allow such a thing to happen.

740
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,120
I'll be counting on you then,

741
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:46,639
Official Feng.

742
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,600
It's so cold today.

743
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,399
Yet, His Lordship has come
to receive Her Highness in person.

744
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,199
They are very much in love indeed.

745
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:04,879
I think

746
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,000
it's more likely because His Lordship

747
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,280
doesn't want her to be upset

748
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,879
when she finds out

749
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,040
Prince Lanxi has been promoted,

750
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:13,399
so His Lordship
is doing this to placate her.

751
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,479
Mind your words, Duke Liang.

752
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,280
Her Highness may be
His Lordship's second queen,

753
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,600
but her virtuousness is unparalleled.

754
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,199
Her Highness wouldn't be upset
because Prince Lanxi

755
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:21,760
was granted a title.

756
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,560
(Everlasting Prosperity and Peace)

757
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,120
Here. Let me help you.

758
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,639
Come on.

759
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,000
Take care.

760
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,719
What's going on?

761
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,280
That doesn't look like Baili's carriage.

762
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,760
Feng Ju.

763
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:45,879
Go and take a look.

764
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:46,800
Yes, Father.

765
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,399
Who dares disturb His Lordship?

766
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,600
Leave at once.

767
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,479
How dare you?
Can you not even recognize Her Highness?

768
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:57,360
Her Highness?

769
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,760
Her Highness...

770
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,080
Greetings, Mother.

771
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,080
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

772
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,600
Get up, everyone.

773
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:09,439
You don't have to address me as such.

774
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,760
Just call me Madam Baili.

775
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,520
(Cangyun Pavilion)

776
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,639
Your Lordship, it is Her Highness.

777
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,959
Baili?

778
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:20,199
His Lordship is here.

779
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,639
Greetings, Your Lordship.

780
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,919
Get up.

781
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:32,919
What is going on?

782
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:36,000
I heard Xi got into danger
when I was in the mountains.

783
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,360
So I prayed to Buddha.

784
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:41,360
As long as Xi could come back safely,

785
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:43,959
as his mother, I would dress plainly
without accessories

786
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,120
and return to the capital on foot.

787
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,679
Bodhisattva answered my prayers.

788
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,280
On my way back, I encountered

789
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:52,120
a group of flood victims
who were heading to the capital

790
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,040
to seek refuge.

791
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,280
I know Your Lordship
cares very much for the people,

792
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,399
so I lent them a hand.

793
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,439
Mother, your leg
was previously injured...

794
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:02,120
But Mother,

795
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,479
didn't you suffer a leg injury before?

796
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,159
You're all right, Xi.

797
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,320
I am so glad.

798
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,360
I've made you worry, Your Highness.

799
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:12,919
I am all right.

800
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:14,800
Your Highness has had a tiring journey.

801
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,719
You've had a tiring trip, Baili.

802
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,080
Return to the palace with me now.

803
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,080
Let's go.

804
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,560
(Everlasting Prosperity and Peace)

805
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,840
Your Lordship,
I have another matter to report.

806
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,879
A while ago,

807
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
I ran into

808
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,879
the wife of our clan leader
at the Yutan Stream.

809
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,280
During our conversation,

810
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,360
I learned
that Mother-in-law was a descendant

811
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,159
of the Xiao family
of the previous dynasty.

812
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:40,520
Is that true?

813
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,600
I wouldn't dare lie to Your Lordship.

814
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,040
Madam Xiao has updated
the genealogy register.

815
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,959
It will be sent to the capital
in a couple of days.

816
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,959
Xi.

817
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,320
Baili has been so thoughtful of you.

818
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,360
She cares for you deeply.

819
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,959
We in Yongzhou
have always valued filial piety.

820
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,879
Shouldn't you

821
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,959
give her a ride

822
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,639
as a gesture of gratitude?
