How far are we
from the Hot Spring Palace?

21
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,639
Not far, Father.

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,720
Twenty li at most.

23
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,199
How much further?

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,520
At least fifty li.

25
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,880
Welcome, Your Lordship.

26
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,301
(Hot Spring Palace)

27
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,039
Rise.

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,839
Thank you, Your Lordship.

29
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,279
I heard Lanxi is unwell.

30
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:35,919
I came to see him.

31
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,919
His Highness
has just taken his medicine.

32
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,639
I'm afraid His Highness is asleep now.

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,720
Lanxi's health is poor.

34
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,479
That is why he came
to the Hot Spring Palace to recuperate.

35
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,080
Why has his condition worsened instead?

36
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,600
How did you take care of him?

37
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,600
It is my incompetency.

38
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,600
Please punish me, Your Lordship.

39
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,320
I'll let Lanxi

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,919
decide that matter.

41
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,039
Let's go.

42
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,080
Father, what should we do?

43
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,479
Lanxi.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Father has come to see you.

45
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,320
Xi.

46
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,199
Lanxi.

47
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,839
Father.

48
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,639
Why are you here?

49
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:42,279
No need to get up.

50
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,479
Ju said

51
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,720
that your condition had worsened.

52
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,520
I come to see how you are faring.

53
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,440
I made you worry.

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,960
Ju saw me

55
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,960
undergoing treatment yesterday.

56
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,039
He must have been worried.

57
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,679
Even so,

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,600
you shouldn't have alarmed Father, Ju.

59
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:02,080
Father.

60
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,679
I was just worried about Lanxi.

61
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,839
I'm glad that you're all right, Lanxi.

62
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:10,080
Why is your condition getting worse?

63
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:11,919
I brought the physician.

64
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,839
Let him take a look at you.

65
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:14,960
Physician Wu.

66
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,800
Present.

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,279
Check Lanxi's pulse.

68
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,119
Yes, Your Lordship.

69
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,200
How is it?

70
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,640
His Highness' pulse is weak.

71
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,320
His Highness is indeed in poor health.

72
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,200
His Highness must have
overexerted himself,

73
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:50,440
causing the cold air to enter his body,

74
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
triggering former afflictions,

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,799
and hurting his cardiopulmonary.

76
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,200
Got it.

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,359
Physician Wu.

78
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,320
Your skills are poor.

79
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,760
Lanxi has been recuperating here.

80
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,119
With the hot spring to nourish him,

81
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,799
how could the cold air enter his body?

82
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,119
Besides, he has been
meditating and resting.

83
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,959
How could he have overexerted himself?

84
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,760
Are you sure it wasn't a misdiagnosis?

85
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,600
I am certain.

86
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,839
That is indeed
what His Highness' pulse shows.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
Please understand, Your Lordship.

88
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,399
What's going on?

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,480
I know my mistakes.
Please punish me, Father.

90
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,359
What mistakes?

91
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,399
I...

92
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,760
I haven't always stayed here.

93
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,160
I had you come here to recover.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,359
But you left without permission.

95
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,079
You deceived the lord.

96
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,519
I know I am at fault.

97
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,040
Tell me.

98
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
What did you do?

99
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,200
Lanxi.

100
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,399
There is no point

101
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:04,760
in hiding it any longer.

102
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,640
Just tell Father the truth.

103
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm sure Father
won't be too harsh on you

104
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,480
as you are his son.

105
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Go on.

106
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,679
Chuanyun. Chuanyu.

107
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:18,720
Bring the items.

108
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:19,760
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

109
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,607
Your writing

110
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,399
has certainly improved over the years.

111
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,160
But what do these

112
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,519
have to do with your worsening state?

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,799
I'm very happy that you can

114
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,799
still recognize my writing, Father.

115
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,359
Actually, I had lied to you

116
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:50,799
when I requested

117
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,040
to come

118
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,200
to the Hot Spring Palace back then.

119
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,920
So what was your purpose
for coming here?

120
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,760
To copy scriptures?

121
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,559
Because Mt. Anyu

122
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,040
is located behind the Hot Spring Palace.

123
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,559
Mt. Anyu?

124
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,119
The late queen's cemetery?

125
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,440
If you had wanted to mourn your mother,

126
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,920
you could've just told me the truth.

127
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,679
Why do you hide it from me?

128
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,000
Father...

129
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Do you remember

130
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,880
how this place came to be?

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,880
After Mother passed away,

132
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,559
she was buried in Mt. Anyu.

133
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,559
You often came to mourn her back then.

134
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:37,000
And you found a hot spring
in the mountain.

135
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:38,799
That's why you built

136
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,320
the Hot Spring Palace.

137
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:42,200
For the following two years,

138
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,799
you visited often.

139
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,359
But have you

140
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,320
ever come here since then?

141
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,359
For so long,

142
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:55,040
Mother's grave and this palace

143
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,679
have been left with only each other.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,679
You are blaming me.

145
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,359
I don't dare.

146
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,760
I am aware

147
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,839
that the world is turbulent.

148
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,839
Father has always been thinking
of Yongzhou

149
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,399
and dedicated everything to it.

150
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:17,279
This was all to
protect the people of Yongzhou

151
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,640
and the Feng family's legacy.

152
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,760
I dare not blame you.

153
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,239
I'm sure Mother wouldn't as well.

154
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,160
But...

155
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:26,679
fifteen years have passed.

156
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,200
I miss her so much.

157
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,679
That's why I used the excuse
of recuperating my health

158
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,119
to come to Mt. Anyu.

159
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,760
I copied scriptures and burned them

160
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
as an offering to Mother

161
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,400
to help her soul find peace

162
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:44,719
and to pray for your well-being.

163
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,599
That is nothing bad or wrong.

164
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,799
Why did you not tell me?

165
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,039
I couldn't bring it up.

166
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,880
Why?

167
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,919
If I had made the request

168
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,919
to mourn Mother,

169
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,799
I would've brought up
sad memories for you.

170
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:06,919
Moreover,

171
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,159
if I had brought it up,

172
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,760
I feared

173
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,039
that rumors might have spread
in the court and the people.

174
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,239
Get up.

175
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,559
I have done wrong.

176
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,520
You have a heart of filial piety

177
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:23,799
and consider the bigger picture.

178
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,679
What is wrong with that?

179
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,280
You have done nothing wrong.

180
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,239
Don't stay here anymore.

181
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,200
Come back with me to the capital of Yongzhou.

182
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:36,559
In a few days,

183
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,200
the autumn hunt will be held.

184
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,320
Yes, Father.

185
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Pack your things.

186
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,060
(Hot Spring Palace)

187
00:09:58,393 --> 00:09:59,713
If His Highness
hadn't made it back in time,

188
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:01,672
our heads would've rolled by now.

189
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,713
His Highness wouldn't let that happen.

190
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:07,153
I've always had faith in him.

191
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:16,432
Zhong Li.

192
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:18,273
Did His Highness make it back in time?

193
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:19,313
Of course.

194
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:20,953
Otherwise,
we wouldn't be standing here right now.

195
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:21,873
That's good.

196
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:23,992
How did you get separated
from His Highness?

197
00:10:23,992 --> 00:10:24,672
Where's the carriage?

198
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:25,992
We were in a rush.

199
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:26,992
The rut broke.

200
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,273
(Once we got the message from Cangyi,)

201
00:10:28,513 --> 00:10:29,552
(we took the shortcut to hurry back.)

202
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,992
(But the rocky terrain
caused the rut to break.)

203
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:33,073
(Thankfully,
His Highness pulled me to safety.)

204
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,153
(After that,)

205
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:36,193
(His Highness left ahead
to get back here.)

206
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:37,912
His Highness has always
managed to turn the situation around.

207
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:39,393
The deities must be helping him.

208
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:47,472
You even got a bird from your trip.

209
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:49,792
You are really
addicted to training birds.

210
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:51,552
Miss Feng entrusted
this bird to His Highness.

211
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:52,912
Miss Feng?

212
00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:55,352
Bai Fengxi?

213
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:56,513
Yes.

214
00:10:57,513 --> 00:11:00,393
His Highness has been
with her all this time.

215
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,513
Yes.

216
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:03,432
Miss Feng

217
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:05,032
has been with His Highness
throughout this trip.

218
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:06,592
We only separated

219
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,672
after the incident in Yucheng.

220
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,513
Remember.

221
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:12,273
Pay closer attention
to the people around His Highness.

222
00:11:13,393 --> 00:11:14,073
Father.

223
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:15,232
A while ago,

224
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,193
you were just telling us not
to interfere with His Highness' matters.

225
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:20,833
This matter
concerns His Highness' safety.

226
00:11:21,193 --> 00:11:21,992
It's an exception.

227
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:24,672
Understood.

228
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:25,833
Let's go.

229
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:27,432
Come on.

230
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:32,393
Your dark appearance

231
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,112
does make you look like that foxy.

232
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:49,713
Xi.

233
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:51,672
Master.

234
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:53,713
Something has happened
to the Luoyan Sect.

235
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,073
The Soultaker Sect attacked them.

236
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:58,352
Only three
of the entire sect's 57 members

237
00:11:58,792 --> 00:11:59,992
made it out alive.

238
00:12:01,992 --> 00:12:03,552
We will seek justice for them.

239
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:05,232
Gather the best fighters in our sect.

240
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:07,513
Tomorrow,
we will head down the mountain together.

241
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:09,232
Yes, Master.

242
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:26,232
Your Highness,
everything has been packed.

243
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:30,953
Master.

244
00:12:32,153 --> 00:12:34,073
Do you think my father
wanted me to be there today?

245
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,112
Or would he rather I was not?

246
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:40,112
A subject can't
speculate on his lord's thoughts.

247
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:45,232
Can't or daren't?

248
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:47,912
Both.

249
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,432
When I opened my eyes,

250
00:12:57,873 --> 00:13:00,073
I saw the expression
flash across his face briefly.

251
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:01,513
He looked a little surprised,

252
00:13:03,953 --> 00:13:05,273
and even a little disappointed.

253
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,232
If I weren't in my residence today,

254
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:09,073
I believe he would've punished me,

255
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:12,112
regardless of the reasons.

256
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:14,352
And the title of the heir of Lord

257
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:16,953
would fall into Feng Ju's hands.

258
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:19,313
He might even be relieved.

259
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:22,592
Perhaps His Lordship simply didn't wish
to see Yongzhou's foundation

260
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:24,953
be threatened by the succession war.

261
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,193
Hasn't that always been the case

262
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:30,672
for imperial families
since ancient times?

263
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,313
From the moment

264
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:34,273
he brought Feng Ju
to the Hot Spring Palace,

265
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:37,112
the war has been sounded.

266
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:39,833
Your Highness
need not worry about this for now.

267
00:13:39,992 --> 00:13:41,112
The matter at hand

268
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:43,513
is the autumn hunt
that will be held in three days.

269
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:47,513
What's different about this autumn hunt?

270
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,992
I heard Feng Qiwu of the Feng family

271
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:52,352
would be attending as well.

272
00:13:57,992 --> 00:13:59,592
The true leader of the Feng family.

273
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,873
As a woman,
Feng Qiwu rules the Feng family.

274
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:05,713
She also holds the position

275
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:06,672
of the Minister
of Civil Service Affairs.

276
00:14:07,552 --> 00:14:09,232
That's enough for her
to influence the court.

277
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:11,753
It's not a surprise
that she will be attending.

278
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:13,713
She is of marriageable age.

279
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:15,912
The elders of the Feng family

280
00:14:15,912 --> 00:14:17,112
are urging her to get married.

281
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,313
Marrying Minister Feng

282
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,352
will mean gaining
the support of the Feng family.

283
00:14:22,432 --> 00:14:24,432
What do you think, Your Highness?

284
00:14:27,352 --> 00:14:28,713
I understand what you mean.

285
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:31,273
I will consider this matter later.

286
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:35,552
Is Your Highness refusing

287
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:37,672
for that young lady's sake?

288
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:39,873
You overthink, Master.

289
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,352
We do need

290
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:43,992
to secure Feng Qiwu's support.

291
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:45,833
But if we form
a marriage alliance at this time,

292
00:14:46,592 --> 00:14:47,912
we will draw unwanted attention

293
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:49,513
from Feng Ju and Queen Baili.

294
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:51,552
As for how we may cooperate with her...

295
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:53,992
I'll think of something.

296
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:56,313
We will do everything
according to Your Highness' plan.

297
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,735
(Yongzhou)

298
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,873
Welcome back, Your Highness.

299
00:15:09,873 --> 00:15:10,552
Rise.

300
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:12,073
Thank you, Your Highness.

301
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:16,112
You did well.

302
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:17,592
Have you recovered?

303
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:19,713
I've already mostly recovered.

304
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,273
I am a lowly servant.

305
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:22,833
I thank Your Highness for your concern.

306
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:29,232
This is for you.

307
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:32,112
Thank you, Your Highness.

308
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:34,833
Take good care of Huan.

309
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:35,992
Yes, Your Highness.

310
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:42,032
All of you may leave now.

311
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:43,352
Yes, Miss.

312
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:46,513
Miss Huan.

313
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,840
This must be a hairpin
from Tiangong Workshop.

314
00:15:49,193 --> 00:15:50,833
His Highness treats you well.

315
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:52,432
His Highness only gave this to me

316
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:53,672
because I was injured.

317
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:55,552
His Highness has never cared

318
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:56,992
about accessories and jewelry.

319
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:59,273
His Highness must have
specifically bought it for you.

320
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:00,432
Don't talk nonsense.

321
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:02,592
Your Highness.

322
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:04,992
Early this morning,

323
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:06,472
His Lordship sent someone

324
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:10,112
to deliver the rule book
for the autumn hunt this year.

325
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:12,953
The hunt? Isn't it the same every year?

326
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,273
You will know
once you read it, Your Highness.

327
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,073
This is not a hunt.

328
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:26,073
It's an exam.

329
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:27,352
To be precise,

330
00:16:27,592 --> 00:16:29,232
it's a test to select a husband.

331
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,032
The chief of the Feng family

332
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,753
does indeed hold a lot of influence.

333
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:36,592
Major changes have been made
to this year's autumn hunt.

334
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:39,432
The hunting ground
will have three entrances.

335
00:16:40,273 --> 00:16:43,193
Each participant may bring
ten subordinates with them

336
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:44,672
and enter the grounds accordingly.

337
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:47,552
It is to assess each prince's ability

338
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:48,833
respectively.

339
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:51,313
Secondly, the winner
is no longer decided

340
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:54,753
by the amount of game
they manage to hunt.

341
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:57,472
The prey is divided
into different tiers.

342
00:16:57,672 --> 00:16:59,832
Pheasants, hares,
and other small creatures

343
00:17:00,112 --> 00:17:00,793
are of the lowest tier.

344
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:03,232
Each animal in this category
is worth only one point.

345
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:06,112
Deer, mountain goats, and other
larger prey are of the third tier.

346
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:08,352
Each of them is worth five points.

347
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:12,712
Jackals and other ferocious beasts
make up the second tier.

348
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,913
Each will be worth ten points.

349
00:17:15,112 --> 00:17:16,673
Eagles and falcons
are of the highest tier.

350
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:18,712
Each of them will earn you 15 points.

351
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:19,712
This is

352
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:22,112
to test the three princes' calculation.

353
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:24,232
His Lordship has also stated

354
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:25,673
that those presenting the gifts

355
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:27,712
will have to prepare
words of dedication as well.

356
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:30,192
This turns into a literary test.

357
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:33,033
As expected of a test
set by the chief of the Feng family.

358
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,913
Feng Qiwu is clever indeed.

359
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:38,072
I'm afraid she herself is worth more

360
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:41,352
than what the Feng family can offer.

361
00:17:42,112 --> 00:17:44,513
The one who excels in both
will earn her favor, making the tale

362
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:47,832
of the phoenix that only resides
in the Chinese parasol tree true.

363
00:17:48,592 --> 00:17:50,433
The one who acquires
her support will gain the world.

364
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:51,952
So

365
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:55,513
what will be Your Highness'
course of action this year?

366
00:17:56,832 --> 00:17:59,592
It's never too high for mountains,
and too deep for seas.

367
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:02,832
It is time.

368
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:07,232
The Tie family of Peicheng
was massacred yesterday.

369
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:10,273
They should be
the Soultaker Sect's latest targets.

370
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:12,033
We will split up into two groups

371
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,952
and see if we can find any leads.

372
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:15,992
Understood.

373
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:16,753
Understood.

374
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:18,312
Whether you find anything or not,

375
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:20,072
we will meet up

376
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:22,112
at the Xuanyi Inn in the east
of the city when it is dark.

377
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:23,352
Yes, Master.

378
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:27,592
Sir.

379
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:29,192
Has she returned to Tianshuang Sect?

380
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:30,112
Yes.

381
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:31,673
Miss Feng
has returned to Tianshuang Sect.

382
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:32,832
However,

383
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:35,232
things have not been peaceful
in the martial arts world lately.

384
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,592
Ten sects, including
Lieyang Sect, Luoyan Sect,

385
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:38,553
and Xuanyuan Sect,

386
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,033
have all been eliminated
by the Soultaker Sect.

387
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:42,352
Some from the Luoyan Sect escaped.

388
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:43,832
They have asked
the Tianshuang Sect for help.

389
00:18:44,472 --> 00:18:45,832
They are persistent.

390
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:48,232
Send someone to keep an eye on them.

391
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:49,352
Yes, sir.

392
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:51,592
Wait.

393
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,312
Also,

394
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:56,072
send Cangyi to keep an eye
on Tianshuang Sect.

395
00:18:56,472 --> 00:18:57,472
As the leader of the righteous sects,

396
00:18:57,793 --> 00:18:59,592
they wouldn't sit idly by
and do nothing.

397
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:00,832
We might make

398
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,033
more discoveries by following them.

399
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:05,513
Understood.

400
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:26,832
Thank you, Fei Yu.

401
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:28,273
Master Bai.

402
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:30,673
Why did you suddenly ask
to see the Tie family's bodies?

403
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:32,273
A mysterious force suddenly appeared

404
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:33,192
in the martial arts world.

405
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:34,712
The Soultaker Sect.

406
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:36,112
Recently,

407
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:38,592
they've been conducting mass killings
throughout the martial arts world.

408
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,753
I led the members of my sect

409
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:42,832
down the mountain
to investigate this matter.

410
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:44,352
They appear

411
00:19:45,273 --> 00:19:46,793
to be connected to the massacre
of the Tie family as well.

412
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,232
That's why I came here.

413
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:52,273
All the bodies
of the Tie family are here.

414
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:54,112
Examine the bodies.

415
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:12,153
Master.

416
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:13,352
I have confirmation.

417
00:20:13,992 --> 00:20:14,712
It is their deed.

418
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:17,273
Was it really the Soultaker Sect?

419
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:20,112
Such evil characters...

420
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:22,232
I will write to the capital

421
00:20:22,673 --> 00:20:23,673
and send someone
to investigate this at once.

422
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:25,273
Thank you, Governor Cheng.

423
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,472
The martial arts world
and the court are connected.

424
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,393
I will do my best.

425
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:31,352
Where the Soultaker passes,
nothing is left behind.

426
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:33,913
These villains are not humans.

427
00:20:34,273 --> 00:20:36,513
Lives mean nothing to them.

428
00:20:37,592 --> 00:20:39,112
Their hearts
are not in the mortal realm either.

429
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:41,793
"Hell is empty,
and all the devils are here."

430
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:43,873
As long as they are not eradicated,

431
00:20:44,673 --> 00:20:45,992
more lives will be lost,

432
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:48,352
and more tragedies will occur.

433
00:20:49,112 --> 00:20:49,873
This time,

434
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:51,312
no matter how hard it will be,

435
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,753
we have to find traces
of the Soultaker Sect.

436
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:56,192
We need to purge them

437
00:20:56,192 --> 00:20:57,273
and send them back to hell.

438
00:20:57,793 --> 00:20:59,232
They are scary and detestable.

439
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:01,433
But what I fear more

440
00:21:01,952 --> 00:21:03,952
is the resurgence
of the force behind them.

441
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:06,433
If they can use the Soultaker Sect
as their vessels today,

442
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:09,673
they can use someone else
as their vessels tomorrow.

443
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:11,192
No matter where they are,

444
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:13,592
I will not

445
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:16,832
leave a single one of them alive.

446
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:19,592
Master.

447
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:20,355
(Disicple of Tianshuang Sect, Gu Yu)
I led my group

448
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:21,273
(Disicple of Tianshuang Sect, Gu Yu)
to check all the inns in the city.

449
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:22,832
We didn't find anything suspicious.

450
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:24,192
(Disciple of Tianshuang Sect, Lu Shi)
A few of the junior disciples and I

451
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:25,312
investigated

452
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:26,873
all the restaurants
and eateries in the city.

453
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:28,273
We didn't find any clues either.

454
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:30,633
It's as if these people
never appeared in the city.

455
00:21:32,153 --> 00:21:32,513
Master.

456
00:21:32,513 --> 00:21:32,832
Father.

457
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:34,633
Master, the three of us searched

458
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:35,952
the abandoned houses in the city.

459
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:38,112
We found one that had signs
of someone living there.

460
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:38,753
That residence

461
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:40,832
should be their hiding place.

462
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:42,072
It's a pity that we were late.

463
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:43,232
They had already left.

464
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:44,832
These people are secretive and cautious.

465
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,633
If they get away,

466
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:47,352
it'll be difficult
to track them down again.

467
00:21:48,112 --> 00:21:49,192
It is imperative

468
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:51,033
that we find out

469
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:52,312
who their next target is.

470
00:21:52,952 --> 00:21:53,873
That's the only way

471
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:55,433
to get ahead of them

472
00:21:55,832 --> 00:21:57,592
and follow the trail to find them.

473
00:21:57,913 --> 00:21:59,913
Based on the order of their attacks,

474
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,793
they should be moving
from Beizhou all the way down south.

475
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:04,232
That means
they should be headed to Youzhou next.

476
00:22:04,832 --> 00:22:05,673
Who will be

477
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:07,712
their target in Youzhou?

478
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:18,393
Are they really

479
00:22:18,513 --> 00:22:20,352
just moving from the north down south?

480
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:24,592
What is their objective?

481
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:28,352
(What is the Soultaker Sect)

482
00:22:29,472 --> 00:22:30,873
(trying to do?)

483
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:39,232
If only that Black Foxy was here.

484
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,433
At least he could
come up with some ideas.

485
00:22:41,952 --> 00:22:43,832
If it were him, what would he think?

486
00:22:51,393 --> 00:22:52,952
To find out where the problem lies...

487
00:22:53,753 --> 00:22:55,513
One must eliminate the false
and retain the true.

488
00:22:56,873 --> 00:22:57,832
The riff-raff...

489
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,153
Of the Soultaker Sect...

490
00:23:00,992 --> 00:23:02,273
Never do something for nothing.

491
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:03,873
Everything they do...

492
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:04,832
Everything they do...

493
00:23:05,112 --> 00:23:06,192
- must be for a purpose.
- must be for a purpose.

494
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:11,112
I do think

495
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:13,553
I have some of his verve
when I imitate him.

496
00:23:15,913 --> 00:23:17,472
Talk is easy.

497
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:19,592
But what exactly is their purpose?

498
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,472
They're definitely not doing that
to take advantage of the situation.

499
00:23:23,913 --> 00:23:24,913
Ten families.

500
00:23:27,735 --> 00:23:28,592
These ten...

501
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:29,273
No!

502
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:30,873
Eleven families.

503
00:23:31,553 --> 00:23:33,112
Eleven families were brutally murdered.

504
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:35,592
This is no mere coincidence.

505
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:39,033
The Han family.

506
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:40,832
The Tie family.

507
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,633
Luoyan Sect. Yueyang Sect.

508
00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:44,753
Their goal

509
00:23:46,232 --> 00:23:47,553
must lie within these sects.

510
00:23:48,072 --> 00:23:51,033
But these sects
have no ties to each other.

511
00:23:51,393 --> 00:23:52,153
There must be

512
00:23:53,072 --> 00:23:54,433
a smokescreen among these sects.

513
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:00,513
Mohan Palace.

514
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:02,712
The Han family.

515
00:24:04,232 --> 00:24:05,072
Tengjiang Sect.

516
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:07,832
Xuanyuan Sect.

517
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:09,472
The Tie family.

518
00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:12,472
The Yuan family.

519
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,352
That Black Foxy once said

520
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:24,633
the Soultaker Sect
went after the Han family

521
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:25,553
for their prescription.

522
00:24:26,153 --> 00:24:27,352
The Han family is an expert in medicine.

523
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:29,192
They could use them
as their rear supply.

524
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,673
So this is what they were after.

525
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:34,913
The Xuanyuan Sect is good
at setting up formations for the troops.

526
00:24:35,232 --> 00:24:36,153
The Tie family is skilled in smithing.

527
00:24:36,873 --> 00:24:38,753
All of those, along with the forces
behind the Soultaker Sect...

528
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,393
They're not just after
the martial arts world.

529
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:45,112
The Soultaker Sect

530
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:48,393
is building a formidable army.

531
00:24:51,553 --> 00:24:53,352
(If we follow this logic...)

532
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:55,393
(Who will be their next target?)

533
00:24:58,472 --> 00:24:59,832
- The Ma family of Jizhou.
- The Ma family of Jizhou.

534
00:25:00,273 --> 00:25:00,913
Zhong Li!

535
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,312
Yes, Your Highness.

536
00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:05,832
Have Cangyi
send a message to Fengxi immediately.

537
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:07,153
Tell her the Soultaker Sect's target

538
00:25:07,153 --> 00:25:07,992
is the Ma family of Jizhou.

539
00:25:08,192 --> 00:25:09,232
Have them go to their aid at once.

540
00:25:09,712 --> 00:25:10,232
Also,

541
00:25:10,753 --> 00:25:11,793
have our people at the Jizhou division

542
00:25:12,072 --> 00:25:13,153
be ready to support them at any time.

543
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,072
Yes, Your Highness.

544
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:18,273
Greetings, Your Lordship.

545
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:38,513
All of you may rise.

546
00:25:38,992 --> 00:25:40,592
Thank you, Your Lordship.

547
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:04,393
Your Lordship.

548
00:26:05,112 --> 00:26:06,033
It is time.

549
00:26:06,753 --> 00:26:07,433
Sound the drum.

550
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:08,873
Yes, Your Lordship.

551
00:26:09,553 --> 00:26:11,952
Sound the drum!

552
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,642
(Yong)

553
00:26:51,393 --> 00:26:52,232
Straight to the depths!

554
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:53,913
We are not after pheasants or hares!

555
00:26:54,153 --> 00:26:55,553
We are going to hunt jackals!

556
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,480
(Rainwater from Jiangnan)

557
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,280
(Snowwater from Plum Blossom)

558
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,680
(Spring Water)

559
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:40,273
Your Highness.

560
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:43,072
This is water from the spring.

561
00:27:43,592 --> 00:27:44,673
This is rainwater from Jiangnan.

562
00:27:45,112 --> 00:27:46,312
This is water from the snow
collected from plum blossom trees.

563
00:27:47,553 --> 00:27:48,832
Snow water from plum blossom trees?

564
00:28:20,753 --> 00:28:21,592
I'm in luck today.

565
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:23,592
I can't believe I came across
a top-tier gyrfalcon.

566
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,112
What are you standing around for?
Go after it!

567
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:47,433
Chuanyun. Chuanyu.

568
00:28:47,832 --> 00:28:48,592
Go on.

569
00:28:48,753 --> 00:28:49,352
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

570
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:25,513
Your Highness! Slow down!

571
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:27,753
Stop, Your Highness!

572
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:41,112
Your Highness, let's not give up
the entire hunting ground

573
00:29:41,393 --> 00:29:43,153
for a few gyrfalcons.

574
00:29:47,832 --> 00:29:48,352
Let's go!

575
00:29:48,793 --> 00:29:49,553
Let's go.

576
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:51,112
My Lady,

577
00:29:51,312 --> 00:29:53,712
these princes
have some skills in archery.

578
00:29:54,312 --> 00:29:55,673
(Chief of Feng Family, Feng Qiwu)
Who knows how much captive prey

579
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:57,352
the guards have released
into these grounds beforehand?

580
00:29:57,592 --> 00:29:59,312
They're dull-witted.

581
00:30:00,072 --> 00:30:01,273
If you join the hunt,

582
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:02,633
you might even

583
00:30:02,913 --> 00:30:04,112
be able to shoot
with unfailing accuracy.

584
00:30:04,712 --> 00:30:06,033
(Feng Family Elder, Feng Yanshou)
If you were to join the hunt, My Lady,

585
00:30:06,753 --> 00:30:08,352
I'm afraid not even half
of these young men

586
00:30:08,592 --> 00:30:09,832
are a match for you.

587
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:11,992
But I must remind you.

588
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,072
Your priority today

589
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:16,192
is to find a suitable husband.

590
00:30:16,992 --> 00:30:17,992
I would like to do that.

591
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:20,952
But which of those on your list

592
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,553
is worthy of becoming the husband
of the chief of the Feng family?

593
00:30:24,513 --> 00:30:25,793
It's mainly His Lordship's sons

594
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:27,192
that we're observing, My Lady.

595
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:29,312
They are inside the hunting ground too.

596
00:30:29,673 --> 00:30:30,513
The Feng family

597
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,952
is one of the most important families
in Yongzhou.

598
00:30:33,112 --> 00:30:35,433
If it weren't for the fact
that since the late chief's generation,

599
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:36,232
we've often been
stationed at the western frontier,

600
00:30:36,472 --> 00:30:38,040
our ancestors often married members

601
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,952
of the royal families
of the Six States as well.

602
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:42,192
The eldest and legitimate sons
of affluential noble families

603
00:30:42,873 --> 00:30:44,592
may not be willing
to marry into the Feng family.

604
00:30:45,072 --> 00:30:46,712
But if you become the consort

605
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:48,352
of the future heir of Lord,

606
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:50,033
it will bring nothing

607
00:30:50,352 --> 00:30:53,072
but benefits for the Feng family.

608
00:30:53,232 --> 00:30:53,793
Not to mention

609
00:30:53,913 --> 00:30:54,832
those three princes

610
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:57,873
are some
of the finest among men as well.

611
00:30:58,472 --> 00:30:59,072
Is that so?

612
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,153
That must be the eldest prince.

613
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:06,232
He is handsome.

614
00:31:06,753 --> 00:31:08,072
But look at what he is doing.

615
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:10,633
He used fawns as bait

616
00:31:11,513 --> 00:31:12,913
to lure out the king of deer.

617
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:15,393
He is really ruthless.

618
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:16,952
If I marry him,

619
00:31:17,553 --> 00:31:19,592
I might die in his hands one day.

620
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,553
As for the Third Prince...

621
00:31:22,753 --> 00:31:24,633
He is determined
to track down the jackals.

622
00:31:25,192 --> 00:31:26,513
It's obvious from first glance
that he is ambitious

623
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:27,913
but possesses mediocre skills.

624
00:31:28,673 --> 00:31:30,712
All he has going for him
is that he is the legitimate son

625
00:31:31,312 --> 00:31:32,712
of the second queen, Queen Baili.

626
00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:33,992
What about the Second Prince?

627
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:36,472
He is the legitimate son

628
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:38,513
of Princess Yige from Imperial Family,
His Lordship's first queen.

629
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:40,352
Not only is he talented
and knowledgeable,

630
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,153
but he is also one of the Four Gentry
in the world.

631
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,633
He has a high status and lineage.

632
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,072
But he is the type of man

633
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,873
I dislike the most.

634
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:55,513
Weak and even fussier
about minute details than a woman.

635
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:58,393
Your words may be harsh,

636
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:00,192
but they also hit the mark.

637
00:32:01,312 --> 00:32:03,753
Perhaps it is because all three princes

638
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:04,753
each have their strengths and weaknesses

639
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:06,352
that His Lordship

640
00:32:06,673 --> 00:32:08,153
has yet to name his heir.

641
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:11,232
If Young Chief hadn't left us so soon,

642
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:14,592
the Feng family
wouldn't be left without an heir.

643
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:17,352
Without an heir?

644
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,433
Is my surname not Feng?

645
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,992
Have I ever made a mistake
in all these years

646
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:22,952
that I have been leading the clan

647
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:24,393
in place of my late brother?

648
00:32:25,352 --> 00:32:26,312
I misspoke.

649
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:28,712
You can stop pressing the issue.

650
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:29,992
At worst, I'll stay
unmarried for the rest of my life.

651
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:32,352
When I'm old, I'll just adopt an heir

652
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:33,352
from a branch of the family.

653
00:32:42,992 --> 00:32:43,673
Chang.

654
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:44,992
You certainly know
how to enjoy yourself.

655
00:32:45,592 --> 00:32:46,592
Do you want to join me for a cup of tea?

656
00:32:48,072 --> 00:32:48,832
Have you forgotten

657
00:32:49,273 --> 00:32:50,952
why we are here?

658
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:55,952
You know my health.

659
00:32:56,472 --> 00:32:57,312
Besides,

660
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,433
I'm not good at riding and archery.

661
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:02,553
Aren't you worried Father will be angry?

662
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:04,273
I've already sent Chuanyun and Chuanyu

663
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,633
to hunt some prey for me.

664
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:07,433
That should satisfy Father.

665
00:33:12,553 --> 00:33:14,352
What could they hunt?

666
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:24,112
Don't let Feng Ju know.

667
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:26,753
I don't want him
to say things to Father again.

668
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:30,112
Later, get on your horse
and ride around for a bit as well.

669
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,873
But don't go too fast.

670
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:32,793
Lest your asthma acts up.

671
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:34,553
I'm off.

672
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:39,553
It seems

673
00:33:39,873 --> 00:33:40,952
the First Prince isn't all that useless.

674
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,232
At least he cares about his brother.

675
00:33:46,913 --> 00:33:48,753
Your Highness, it's almost time.

676
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:52,513
Has the gyrfalcon reached?

677
00:33:52,913 --> 00:33:53,633
It should have.

678
00:33:58,312 --> 00:34:01,472
I hope Ju will like
the gift I prepared for him.

679
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:18,473
I'm in luck.

680
00:34:57,272 --> 00:34:58,633
I didn't expect you guys
to know how to use tactics.

681
00:34:59,352 --> 00:35:00,592
Closing around me is a nice plan.

682
00:35:01,072 --> 00:35:01,592
Unfortunately,

683
00:35:02,473 --> 00:35:03,993
one of you is too weak.

684
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:46,352
Your Highness, how did you...

685
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,792
I heard that the Feng family
is best at keeping secrets.

686
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:50,112
Chief Feng.

687
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:52,873
Is that right?

688
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:19,633
Chief!

689
00:36:22,072 --> 00:36:22,752
Chief!

690
00:36:25,072 --> 00:36:27,272
Did you kill all of these?

691
00:36:29,673 --> 00:36:30,352
Yes.

692
00:36:31,953 --> 00:36:33,352
You're too reckless.

693
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:35,153
His Lordship

694
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:37,112
has summoned you
to the viewing platform.

695
00:36:37,913 --> 00:36:38,633
Got it.

696
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:40,752
Bring these with us.

697
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:45,940
(Yong)

698
00:36:46,752 --> 00:36:49,112
Greetings, Father.

699
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,512
Rise.

700
00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:51,873
Thank you, Father.

701
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:59,552
Yongzhou was founded upon
archery and horse riding.

702
00:37:00,153 --> 00:37:00,953
In the past,

703
00:37:01,433 --> 00:37:04,153
our ancestors followed Emperor Weilie
to conquer the lands,

704
00:37:04,832 --> 00:37:06,272
and they made great achievements.

705
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:09,272
That is how Yongzhou came to be.

706
00:37:09,752 --> 00:37:10,713
In today's hunting competition,

707
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:12,713
all of you have demonstrated
courage and determination.

708
00:37:13,193 --> 00:37:14,552
I am most pleased.

709
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:16,713
The hunting competition is now over.

710
00:37:17,393 --> 00:37:20,592
I will reward the winner handsomely.

711
00:37:22,312 --> 00:37:22,993
Father.

712
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:25,393
How handsome would that reward be?

713
00:37:25,873 --> 00:37:27,032
Don't try to send us off

714
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:28,713
with pearls, jade,

715
00:37:29,112 --> 00:37:30,473
or some other precious stones.

716
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:33,112
You greedy child.

717
00:37:34,993 --> 00:37:36,512
I will give the winner

718
00:37:36,512 --> 00:37:38,473
the Cloud Cutter Sword passed down
from our ancestors as a prize.

719
00:37:38,993 --> 00:37:40,312
What do all of you think?

720
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,233
Thank you, Father.

721
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:45,592
Chang.

722
00:37:46,312 --> 00:37:48,673
You're the eldest. You go first.

723
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,633
I present my gift to you, Father.

724
00:37:52,552 --> 00:37:53,832
Prince Chang presents

725
00:37:54,153 --> 00:37:56,272
two deer and ten small creatures
to His Lordship.

726
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:58,312
His Highness earns 20 points.

727
00:37:59,552 --> 00:38:00,512
Chang.

728
00:38:00,752 --> 00:38:03,713
What is the significance of your gift?

729
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:05,752
The mountains and the forests are lush.
Animals are abundant.

730
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:07,752
All beings are thriving in Yongzhou.

731
00:38:08,272 --> 00:38:10,193
I would like to present
this abundance to Yongzhou.

732
00:38:10,312 --> 00:38:13,512
May all matters
in Yongzhou prosper and flourish.

733
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:17,153
May all matters thrive in Yongzhou.

734
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:18,312
Good.

735
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:20,873
What about you, Xi?

736
00:38:22,673 --> 00:38:25,752
Father, my spoils require
a bit more effort to gather.

737
00:38:26,032 --> 00:38:28,272
I've sent Chuanyun
and Chuanyu to bring them.

738
00:38:28,752 --> 00:38:31,233
Do they require more effort,
or did you not catch any?

739
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:36,473
Never mind.

740
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:38,352
You've just recovered.

741
00:38:39,032 --> 00:38:40,713
I won't ask too much of you.

742
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:43,032
What about your spoils, Ju?

743
00:38:45,112 --> 00:38:45,953
I present my gift to you, Father.

744
00:38:47,112 --> 00:38:48,752
Prince Ju presents

745
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:51,592
two deer
and two jackals to His Lordship.

746
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:53,193
His Highness earns 30 points.

747
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:56,752
Father, I have a wish
that follows my gift as well.

748
00:38:57,713 --> 00:38:59,433
In the woods, the wolves hunt the deer.

749
00:38:59,752 --> 00:39:01,713
With a bow and arrow,
you can seize them all.

750
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:03,592
May Yongzhou be blessed
with strong soldiers, horses

751
00:39:03,752 --> 00:39:06,193
and successful military expeditions.

752
00:39:06,473 --> 00:39:08,592
Good. Very good.

753
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:10,312
Thank you, Father.

754
00:39:12,832 --> 00:39:14,072
It looks like it's my win.

755
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:22,552
Your Lordship.

756
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,352
I would like to join the fun as well.

757
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:32,072
Feng Qiwu of the Feng family
presents four jackals to His Lordship.

758
00:39:32,193 --> 00:39:33,752
Feng Qiwu earns 40 points.

759
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:46,473
You prove that women
are as capable as men, Minister Feng.

760
00:39:47,193 --> 00:39:49,633
What is the significance
of your gift, then?

761
00:39:49,873 --> 00:39:51,393
The jackals strive
to hunt the heart of the deer.

762
00:39:51,832 --> 00:39:53,953
The wise leader observes
and rules his nation.

763
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:55,633
May

764
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:57,433
Your Lordship's wishes come true.

765
00:39:58,153 --> 00:40:00,352
Well said.

766
00:40:01,272 --> 00:40:05,153
It looks like this sword
will be going to Feng Qiwu.

767
00:40:10,512 --> 00:40:12,713
Is Your Highness' gift not here yet?

768
00:40:39,592 --> 00:40:40,512
What is going on?

769
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:42,552
My gifts are here.

770
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:45,953
Prince Lanxi's gifts?

771
00:40:46,032 --> 00:40:46,993
Well...

772
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:51,713
Your Lordship,
Prince Lanxi presented 20 deer.

773
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:54,272
That would be a perfect score.

774
00:40:54,393 --> 00:40:55,592
I...

775
00:40:56,312 --> 00:40:57,433
You didn't hunt them down.

776
00:40:57,433 --> 00:40:58,233
This is cheating!

777
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:02,072
Father.

778
00:41:03,272 --> 00:41:04,832
Sparing the lives of animals
is a good virtue.

779
00:41:05,272 --> 00:41:06,713
I've been in poor health since young.

780
00:41:07,153 --> 00:41:09,713
Therefore, I do not wish
to take the life of another.

781
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:11,352
Father ordered me
to participate in the hunt.

782
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:14,153
I had no choice but to obey.

783
00:41:14,832 --> 00:41:15,673
I've been ill for a long time.

784
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:17,592
Somehow, that has turned me
into somewhat of a physician.

785
00:41:18,153 --> 00:41:19,592
While I was studying medicine,

786
00:41:20,112 --> 00:41:21,633
I discovered
that the sap of Lanwei flowers

787
00:41:21,633 --> 00:41:23,312
could temporarily tame wild animals.

788
00:41:23,832 --> 00:41:27,112
That's why I had
Chuanyun and the others use this method

789
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:28,393
to lure the prey.

790
00:41:28,673 --> 00:41:29,792
What about your wishes?

791
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:31,512
My wishes

792
00:41:32,153 --> 00:41:33,832
are similar to Minister Feng's.

793
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:38,112
I am willing to hunt for you,

794
00:41:39,032 --> 00:41:39,913
