=Episode 38=

20
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,000
Feng Lanxi is here.

21
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,880
Your Highness,

22
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,800
our men are all exhausted

23
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,559
from a day of restless fight.

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,199
Moyu Cavalry came in full swing.

25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,639
Our remaining soldiers
do not stand a chance.

26
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,199
We should retreat

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,479
and strategize.

28
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,559
Listen up!

29
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,000
Retreat now!

30
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,160
They hurt my woman.

31
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,199
They'll pay the price.

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,800
Chuanyun, Chuanyu!

33
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,240
Protect the Queen of Qingzhou.

34
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,880
Yes, Your Highness!

35
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,800
(Sacred Jade Moon?)

36
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,520
(How did he know this technique too?)

37
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,920
Retreat first.

38
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:44,239
Wuyuan.

39
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:50,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

40
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
It seems like

41
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,359
we underestimated Feng Lanxi.

42
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,920
I didn't know

43
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,760
he could amass an elite force

44
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,160
this swiftly.

45
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,600
They were very well-hidden.

46
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,600
Now, they have pulled
the pincer maneuver on us.

47
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,799
We're at a disadvantage.

48
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,079
I firmly believe

49
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,119
the Wuhui Valley isn't
where we should have our final battle.

50
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,600
This place

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,399
is not a suitable battlefield
for the final battle.

52
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,440
Your Highness,

53
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,119
Shangzhou has claimed Four Cities
of Qiyun.

54
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,399
Like you said,

55
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,440
we cannot have the battle here.

56
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,600
My prediction is correct.

57
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,760
We'll run into a stalemate
in the Wuhui Valley.

58
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,000
A final battle here will cause
great casualties to us.

59
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
The Lords of Shangzhou and Beizhou

60
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,920
will seize this opportunity

61
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,279
and conquer Qiyun.

62
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,399
And then, their strength will increase.

63
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,399
They will no longer

64
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,279
fear you.

65
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,359
Even if we win the battle in the valley,

66
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,959
it doesn't mean we have tamed
Qingzhou and Yongzhou.

67
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,760
Besides,

68
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:50,239
at the moment, we don't have
a sure-fire victory

69
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,079
against the army
of Qingzhou and Yongzhou.

70
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,839
Both parties

71
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,760
stand a 50-50 chance to win the battle
in the valley.

72
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,519
A temporary truce is preferred then.

73
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,239
When you're outnumbered,

74
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,079
just run.

75
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,559
Once Moyu Cavalry arrives,

76
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,799
we fight back.

77
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,359
That is better than injuring yourself.

78
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,839
No.

79
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,239
If we retreat,
morale will be affected.

80
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,760
Also, the geographical formation

81
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:20,000
will pose a challenge
to our retaliation.

82
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,200
Besides,

83
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,640
I know you will arrive in time.

84
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,480
I found something peculiar just now.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,119
I fought Yu Wuyuan

86
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,200
and he used Sacred Jade Moon.

87
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,399
How did he know that technique?

88
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,720
So it was him

89
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,799
who attacked you in the alley that day?

90
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
It seems like the mastermind

91
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,600
of Yongzhou's unrest

92
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,839
and Soultaker Sect

93
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,480
is Yu Wuyuan.

94
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,279
The jade pendant, Sacred Jade Moon...

95
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,920
The Empyrean Yu family
hides a lot of secrets.

96
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,760
Yu Wuyuan has been aiding Huang Chao.

97
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,040
Is Huang Chao part of it too?

98
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,119
I don't think Huang Chao
is aware of his double identity.

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,720
Yu Wuyuan

100
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,480
had

101
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,559
everyone fooled.

102
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,440
Oh.

103
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:12,320
Zhong Li just fetched news.

104
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,920
Shangzhou has claimed
Four Cities of Qiyun.

105
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,559
Lord of Beizhou is also coming
to the south.

106
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,640
At the moment,

107
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,880
Huang Chao has no reason
to continue fighting.

108
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,559
Your Ladyship.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,519
A truce proposed by Lord of Youzhou.

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,679
During the war
between Youzhou and Qingzhou,

111
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,880
the other states attacked other regions.

112
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,279
The war has already begun.

113
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,119
A truce proposal

114
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,920
is just a temporary strategy
to buy more time.

115
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,880
Worried about Yu Wuyuan?

116
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,600
He was known to be a benevolent person.

117
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,880
Yet he devised so many
nefarious schemes.

118
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,720
I'm worried

119
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,040
that

120
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,559
he might sway the outcome.

121
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,799
We still haven't deciphered
the secret

122
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:09,880
behind the Empyrean Yu family.

123
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,160
There are still many factors
affecting the current situation.

124
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,359
But no matter what,

125
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,480
I'll be by your side.

126
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,399
Qingzhou's crisis is over.

127
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,399
And now...

128
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,760
I'll go back to Yongzhou.

129
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,080
I can only inform my father

130
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,479
about my wish to marry
the Queen of Qingzhou when I head back.

131
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,599
What gives you the confidence

132
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,479
that I'll say yes?

133
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,640
You

134
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
gave me the confidence.

135
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,799
I can be quite demanding.

136
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,359
When the Queen of Qingzhou
arrives in Yongzhou,

137
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,440
she will be greeted
with ten li of floral sea.

138
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,782
(Yongzhou Royal Palace)

139
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,440
I know

140
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,919
what you have been up to

141
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,520
lately.

142
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,159
I didn't expect

143
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,080
that the famous Bai Fengxi

144
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,679
was in fact
the Princess Feng Xiyun of Qingzhou.

145
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,000
Truth be told,

146
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,479
I was surprised.

147
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,640
Now that Qingzhou has won the battle.

148
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,919
Jizhou and Youzhou armies
have retreated.

149
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,840
I will give my approval

150
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,599
to the marriage
between Yongzhou and Qingzhou

151
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:49,799
that you proposed.

152
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,119
Thanks, Father.

153
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,559
However,

154
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,679
have you thought about the future?

155
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,919
Once you marry the Queen of Qingzhou,

156
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,280
will she come to Yongzhou

157
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,679
and be the heir's consort

158
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,039
or will you go to Qingzhou

159
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,320
and be hers?

160
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,440
Neither.

161
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,559
An alliance is for politics.

162
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:16,159
A marriage

163
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:18,520
is for the celebration of love.

164
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,799
Love?

165
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,320
I see.

166
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,200
You have made up your mind.

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,880
However,

168
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:31,479
as an Heir, your status might not match

169
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,919
that of a Queen.

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,919
Their ministers or even their people

171
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,520
will lambast you.

172
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,679
That will bring dishonor to Yongzhou.

173
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,000
Father,

174
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,799
Queen of Qingzhou and I
have been through a lot.

175
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,760
She wouldn't mind.

176
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:52,559
We

177
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,799
look beyond social statuses.

178
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,799
Imprudence!

179
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,320
You don't care

180
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,520
but I do.

181
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,919
You know what?

182
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,559
The day you marry her

183
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:08,159
will be the day of your ascension.

184
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,239
You will marry the Queen of Qingzhou
as Lord of Yongzhou.

185
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,119
That's a match made in heaven,

186
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
a pairing of the century.

187
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,200
Father,

188
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,559
do you mean...

189
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,359
It's time for me to retire.

190
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,200
When they were trying to impeach me,

191
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,000
you saved me.

192
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,239
You have my trust.

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,679
Now,

194
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,880
you have your Moyu Cavalry

195
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:37,479
and your political allies.

196
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,799
You are ready

197
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,799
and well-respected.

198
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,520
Why can't I entrust

199
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,280
Yongzhou to you?

200
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:45,679
Also,

201
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,119
you will have another strong ally
in the form of Qingzhou.

202
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,359
It seems like

203
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,799
the world truly belongs
to the young ones.

204
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,679
Thanks, Father.

205
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,559
I will not let you down

206
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,679
and make sure Yongzhou stays prosperous.

207
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,919
That's what I want to hear.

208
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,719
I'm old

209
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,640
and tired.

210
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,000
Those who passed away
kept visiting me in my dreams.

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
The more coveted the throne is,

212
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,200
the lonelier I feel.

213
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,320
However,

214
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,280
after I made this decision,

215
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,760
I feel relieved.

216
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,239
You may go.

217
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:48,359
Yes, Father.

218
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,277
(One Year Later)

219
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,761
(Qingzhou)

220
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,797
(Memorial Tablets
of Qingzhou Lord and Queen)

221
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,559
Father, Mother.

222
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,559
I have told you everything

223
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,559
that happened last year.

224
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,840
Although Qingzhou

225
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,559
lost many of its soldiers in this war,

226
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:31,640
we didn't lose any land.

227
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,840
Licheng is being rebuilt.

228
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:36,061
(Memorial Tablets
of Qingzhou Lord and Queen)

229
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,119
This year,

230
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,559
I take good care of state affairs.

231
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,440
I promised you, Father,

232
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,320
that I would protect Qingzhou.

233
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,880
I did it.

234
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:49,880
I'm sure

235
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,320
I didn't let Father, Mother,

236
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,679
and even Xieyue down.

237
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,705
(Memorial Tablets
of Qingzhou Lord and Queen)

238
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,239
I also

239
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,359
have another important announcement.

240
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,320
I'm getting married.

241
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:17,520
He is a loving man

242
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:20,119
who puts me above all else.

243
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:21,559
(Memorial Tablets
of Qingzhou Lord and Queen)

244
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,159
I'm sure all of you
must be very happy now.

245
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:26,360
(Memorial Tablets
of Qingzhou Lord and Queen)

246
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,719
Your Ladyship,
Yongzhou emissary is here.

247
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:39,320
I see.

248
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,159
Long live the Queen.

249
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,239
At ease.

250
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,080
Thanks, Your Ladyship.

251
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,119
Qiwu?

252
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,119
How may I help,

253
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,400
dear emissary?

254
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,599
I am sent here

255
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,320
under the directive of the heir
of Lord of Yongzhou, Feng Lanxi,

256
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,320
for a marriage proposal.

257
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,400
May I know who this lucky girl is?

258
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,200
You, Your Ladyship.

259
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,919
How dare he!

260
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,599
He's but an Heir.

261
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,960
He can't possibly marry my Queen!

262
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,760
Hear, hear.

263
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,000
(What are they doing?)

264
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,039
(Why are they turning it down for me?)

265
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,760
I told you to turn my story
with Feng Lanxi

266
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,320
into novels and sell them.

267
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,320
Have you done it?

268
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Yes, Your Ladyship.

269
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:07,159
I also used the term Bai-Hei Fengxi

270
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,719
as you requested.

271
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,840
I have done everything.

272
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,280
Storytellers from all corners

273
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,200
are reciting this story.

274
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,880
I told you to brief the ministers first.

275
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,119
Have you done it?

276
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,640
Of course.

277
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,440
Then what is happening?

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,320
This is diplomacy, you see.

279
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,119
A well-timed hesitation and concession

280
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:34,760
can make it look like
you're taking this matter seriously.

281
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,400
Just watch.

282
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,440
Yongzhou is a courteous state.

283
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:42,320
We will respect the rules, of course.

284
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,440
Lord of Yongzhou has announced

285
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,599
that should the Queen of Qingzhou
marry his Heir,

286
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,000
he will renounce the throne

287
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,080
and inaugurate the Heir.

288
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,039
Now that's better.

289
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,760
We appreciate
Lord of Yongzhou's thoughtfulness.

290
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,320
However,

291
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,960
this is not enough for my Queen's hands.

292
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,000
Don't you agree?

293
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:04,920
Yes.

294
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,119
Hear, hear.

295
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,079
Exactly.

296
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,199
I understand.

297
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,760
Our Heir also expressed

298
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:13,199
his wish to form a lasting friendship
with Qingzhou

299
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,319
and is willing to share
the world with you.

300
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,520
How is a simple promise,

301
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,839
a simple condition,

302
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,800
good enough to obtain
my Queen's consent?

303
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,920
Let me finish, General.

304
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,800
After that,

305
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,760
Lord of Yongzhou and Queen of Qingzhou
will have equal power.

306
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,839
Both Qingzhou and Yongzhou
will have two rulers.

307
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,280
I also came
with an abundance of bride prices.

308
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,959
The Court of State Ceremonial outside
is checking it as we speak.

309
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,599
That's sincere enough.

310
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,839
What do you think, Your Ladyship?

311
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,119
A union

312
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,959
between these two states

313
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,719
will only bring blessings
to our subjects.

314
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:04,680
I

315
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,160

your makeup is done.

339
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,719
Don't smudge it.

340
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,319
I will be careful.

341
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,599
We have also put on the gown

342
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and the headdresses for tomorrow.

343
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,760
Do you wish to alter anything?

344
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,040
I am content.

345
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,560
Just proceed as usual.

346
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,079
Noted. I will take my leave then,
Your Ladyship.

347
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,239
Why are you here?

348
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,479
You must

349
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,439
be knackered.

350
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,640
Who knows a marriage
has these many rituals and customs?

351
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,199
You regret it now?

352
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,040
Never.

353
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,839
You, however, broke the rules.

354
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,640
No groom should visit the bride

355
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,599
the night before the marriage.

356
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,119
Ever since you arrived
in the capital of Yongzhou,

357
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:45,000
I can't sit still in my residence.

358
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:47,000
There were people around
at eleven in the morning.

359
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,199
Otherwise, I would have come already.

360
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,280
I also prepared some dishes, snacks,

361
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,160
and fruits.

362
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:54,880
Really?

363
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,119
There'll be Prosperous Fish,
Child-wishing delicacies,

364
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,439
and a harmonious marriage platter.

365
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:01,599
Let's go.

366
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,079
Is it all right to head out now?

367
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:11,479
Since when are you a stickler for rules?

368
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,239
Come.

369
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,839
After you became the Queen of Qingzhou,

370
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,000
even your dining manner
has become much more elegant.

371
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,199
I didn't ask for that.

372
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,920
But before I came out, they told me

373
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,800
not to smudge my makeup.

374
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,199
Otherwise, I wouldn't hold myself back.

375
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,040
Let me feed you.

376
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,800
This, please.

377
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:05,160
Okay.

378
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:13,239
Show me.

379
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,000
Is it all smudged?

380
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:18,520
I don't care.

381
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,359
The dishes today are out of this world.

382
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,400
The merry hour is now!

383
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:12,560

enter the hall.

(Jing Yan: As war ravages our land)

502
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,280
(and my people suffer in great agony,)

503
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,280
(for many nights sleep eludes me)

504
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,400
(and shame consumes my being.)

505
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:53,079
(After days of pondering,)

506
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,920
(I decide to stay
in the Realm of the Kings)

507
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,680
(with the Empyrean Token. I will wait
for its rightful owner to come.)

508
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,560
You work hard, my Queen of Qingzhou.

509
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Have a seat,

510
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:14,599
Lord of Yongzhou.

511
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,119
You're in a cheery mood today.

512
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,400
The war in Beizhou has concluded then?

513
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:24,640
Indeed.

514
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,520
Beizhou surrendered.

515
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,400
The world is now divided
into Yongzhou and Jizhou.

516
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,040
The situation has stabilized.

517
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Jing Yan made an announcement

518
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,880
to summon all rulers
to the Imperial City.

519
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,239
I suppose your next move

520
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:37,680
is to station your troops
on the Realm of the Kings?

521
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,199
Several days ago,

522
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,479
Jizhou sieged the capital of Shangzhou.

523
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:43,439
Lord of Shangzhou came out
in plain clothing

524
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,800
and surrendered the Xuanshu Token,
the emblem of the royal family.

525
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,040
He then said he would serve Huang Chao.

526
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,599
I believe

527
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,319
Huang Chao will head
to the Realm of the Kings soon.

528
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,680
A war against him is inevitable.

529
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,479
Jing Yan's decision

530
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,680
is to buy himself more time,

531
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,560
and let Huang Chao and I
fight among ourselves

532
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,560
while he reaps the benefit.

533
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,479
However, I can seize this opportunity
and obtain the Dethronement Order.

534
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:09,439
Only by claiming the throne myself

535
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,000
that the world can be reunited
once more.

536
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,160
There will be fewer wars.

537
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:17,079
My ascension

538
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,239
will also be a legit one.

539
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,400
Although Huang Chao is domineering,

540
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,599
he is a wise ruler.

541
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,599
He conquered Shangzhou

542
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,479
without hurting the innocent.

543
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,280
In fact, he even won the respect
of the people.

544
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,599
He

545
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,160
is not an easy foe.

546
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,280
The battle between Huang Chao and me

547
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,239
is a battle of kingcraft.

548
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:38,920
To rule the world

549
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,680
is to place the safety
of your people first.

550
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,959
However, I'm worried

551
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,239
about Yu Wuyuan.

552
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,959
After the battle
in the Wuhui Valley,

553
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:47,479
he disappeared.

554
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,199
Most believe

555
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,839
that the Finest Gentry

556
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,719
retired to avoid imposing more hardships
on this world.

557
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,479
But we both know

558
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,599
that he has another agenda.

559
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,599
The war will end soon.

560
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,760
He'll resurface sooner or later.

561
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,239
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

562
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,239
(Supervisor of Fengyun Cavalry, Han Pu)
Your Lordship.

563
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,120
Have a seat, Pu.

564
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,479
What brought you here?

565
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,800
I received news from General Xu.

566
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,399
I wanted

567
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,239
to come here to deliver
the good news to you,

568
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:21,639
but I saw Mr. Feng here.

569
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,760
I then knew

570
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:23,760
Fountain Abode

571
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,479
was once again one step ahead of me.

572
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,320
Why the defeated tone?

573
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,600
Yongzhou and Qingzhou are a family now.

574
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,800
If she's your sister,
then I'm your brother.

575
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,760
There's no need for a pecking order.

576
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,560
Besides,

577
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,719
you're now the supervisor
of Fengyun Cavalry,

578
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,439
General Han.

579
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,879
But this general
hasn't been to war before.

580
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,280
I truly hope

581
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,360
that you never have to.

582
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,679
The war is nigh.

583
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,560
Why don't you follow me
to the training ground?

584
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
It can lift morale.

585
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,199
All right.

586
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,399
As you wish.

587
00:35:06,297 --> 00:35:09,751
(Head to the Imperial City)

588
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,199
Your Lordship, news from Yongzhou.

589
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,679
Lord of Beizhou fled
to the Realm of the Kings?

590
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
It seems like Feng Lanxi

591
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,439
will enter the realm soon too.

592
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,320
How should we proceed?

593
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,479
Whoever enters the realm first

594
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,719
will obtain the Dethronement Order

595
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,840
and can claim the throne.

596
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:46,320
The people
will not acknowledge you otherwise.

597
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,520
We have to be quicker than him.

598
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,919
I will assemble
all three military branches right away.

599
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:53,719
You can assemble them
but morale is very important.

600
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,600
They spill their blood
on the battlefield.

601
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,159
Treat them well.

602
00:35:58,919 --> 00:36:01,560
I heard some people
were embezzling their pay.

603
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,360
Identify the people

604
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,000
and punish them severely.

605
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,600
In addition,

606
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,000
enforce the military disciplines strictly.

607
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Youzhou's army has been incorporated.

608
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,199
Tell them

609
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,320
that I'm doing this

610
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:14,879
for world peace.

611
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,479
I will not hurt the innocent.

612
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,840
Yes, Your Lordship.

613
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,639
Your Lordship,

614
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,679
Her Highness and the Princess Yu
seek an audience with you.

615
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,719
I shall take my leave now.

616
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:30,919
Huang Chao.

617
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,520
I know you're occupied

618
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:36,000
with military affairs lately.

619
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:38,560
I have brewed a nutritious broth
for you, Your Lordship.

620
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,120
Please take good care of yourself.

621
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,600
With your meticulous care,

622
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:45,080
I am as healthy as a horse.

623
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,679
Huang Chao, Sister-in-law.

624
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:49,600
Your marriage

625
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,800
is a subject of envy.

626
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,000
You have

627
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,879
many admirers, you know.

628
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,679
There are many men in this world

629
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:04,040
but none can compare with him.

630
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,439
Still no news about Wuyuan?

631
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,600
After the battle
in the Wuhui Valley,

632
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,239
he left ten silk pouches

633
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,879
and departed quietly.

634
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:17,679
I suppose

635
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,360
he doesn't have it in himself

636
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,120
to witness a bloodbath.

637
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:22,840
Huang Chao,

638
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,000
I want to go to the Imperial City.

639
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,000
The Realm of the Kings is under siege.

640
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,120
Going to the Imperial City now
is too dangerous.

641
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,080
The tomb-sweeping festival is near.

642
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:32,000
Around this time every year,

643
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:34,439
Wuyuan will pay respect
to his ancestors in Qionglin Park.

644
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,800
So

645
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,679
I want to see

646
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,080
if I can chance upon him there.

647
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:42,679
Go then.

648
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,199
But do

649
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,800
take care of yourself.

650
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:50,399
I pray for his immediate return too.

651
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,679
The situation now

652
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,159
is calling for a final battle.

653
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,840
I need him.

654
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:56,679
If you can locate him,

655
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:58,360
tell him

656
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:01,360
that I have never forgotten

657
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:03,159
my promise to him.

658
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:04,840
Noted.

659
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,679
Greetings, Your Majesty.

660
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,919
You're here, General Dong Shufang.

661
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:35,919
Get up now.

662
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:37,639
Yes, Your Majesty.

663
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,040
You came at the right time.

664
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,199
I'm bored lately

665
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,120
so I amuse myself with drawing.

666
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,600
I have improved a lot.

667
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,479
Come have a look.

668
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,479
What do you think of my Moonlit Flower?

669
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,199
I am a soldier.

670
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,080
I do not have the delicateness

671
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,639
to appreciate

672
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,199
the beauty of your painting,
Your Majesty.

673
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,639
I have tried imitating Moonlit Flower

674
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,439
by Mr. Xieyue more than ten times.

675
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,199
This is my finest attempt so far.

676
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,520
However,

677
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:19,840
something's amiss.

678
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,679
Mr. Xieyue's painting is so vivid.

679
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,840
You'll be transported to the scene
when you look at his painting.

680
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:27,560
Marvelous.

681
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,679
Marvelous.

682
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,040
Mighty marvelous.

683
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:32,600
No wonder he has the moniker,
Gentry of Moonlight.

684
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,159
I can't compare with him at all.

685
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,399
Your Majesty,

686
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,040
you are the Emperor.

687
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:46,000
You should focus on national affairs,

688
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:47,639
not

689
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,399
hobbies

690
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:50,600
like these.

691
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:51,679
At the moment,

692
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,360
Jizhou has conquered
Youzhou and Shangzhou.

693
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,959
Yongzhou has conquered
Qingzhou and Beizhou.

694
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,080
It's looking grim.

695
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,199
Please...

696
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,280
Discuss those

697
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,639
with Wuyuan.

698
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:06,479
Your Majesty,

699
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,320
Wuyuan

700
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,479
asked you to summon all rulers

701
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,760
so that Yongzhou and Jizhou
can fight among themselves.

702
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,919
But Your Majesty,

703
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,159
we can't rely on him for everything.

704
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,320
We can't just wait for a free win
to fall onto our laps.

705
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,600
I requested military dispatch
several times

706
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:22,760
but he turned it down.

707
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,320
I have reasons to believe...

708
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,520
News!

709
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,439
Your Majesty,

710
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,439
Mr. Yu is here.

711
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

712
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,879
At ease.

713
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,000
Wuyuan,

714
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:41,840
you came at the right time.

715
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:43,679
Explain to me.

716
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,800
Why did you decline
General Dong Shufang's request

717
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,040
to dispatch the army several times?

718
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:48,479
I declined them

719
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:50,159
because it was not the right timing.

720
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,320
Not the right timing?

721
00:40:54,479 --> 00:40:56,399
I think you have an agenda of your own.

722
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,679
The land today

723
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:00,479
is now divided into Jizhou and Yongzhou.

724
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,879
They respectively have
several hundred thousand soldiers

725
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:04,479
while we only have
a hundred thousand men in the realm.

726
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,199
What is the right timing you speak of?

727
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:09,520
Yes.

728
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,439
As they fight among themselves,

729
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,040
we can just reap the benefit.

730
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,679
That

731
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,280
is the right timing in my opinion.

732
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,919
Your Majesty, I...

733
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:19,760
Enough.

734
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,760
Both of you

735
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,120
are my right-hand men.

736
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,120
I'm sure you two can help me.

737
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,399
I'm tired now.

738
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:30,199
I will get some rest.

739
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,159
Discuss among yourselves.

740
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:35,679
Your Majesty!

741
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:36,439
Your Majesty!

742
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:38,199
Your Majesty!

743
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:41,399
General,

744
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,760
