20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,959
Mr. Yu?

21
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:48,680
Are you Mr. Yu?

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,879
That's me.

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,239
I was originally going
to see Huang Chao in Jizhou.

24
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,199
But on the way,

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,760
I heard
Heroine Feng was at King Ma's castle.

26
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,760
So I hurried here to see

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,919
who this world's oddest woman
as described by Huang Chao is.

28
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,000
The world's oddest woman?

29
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,639
Huang Chao sure likes to come up
with monikers.

30
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,360
Still, what a coincidence.

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,279
I've been wanting to meet you, Mr. Yu.

32
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,679
I didn't expect we'd meet like this.

33
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,759
This circumstance

34
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,880
is all right.

35
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:18,759
This circumstance

36
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,880
- naturally...
- Injured

37
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,759
but still talkative.

38
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,520
My mouth isn't injured.

39
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,320
Moreover,

40
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,199
the mouth is for talking

41
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,199
and eating.

42
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,399
There's no food.

43
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,399
So, I talk.

44
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,440
Mr. Yu...

45
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,199
There is.

46
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,520
What's this?

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,240
Open it.

48
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,320
You brought food!

49
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,520
I've sent people

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,839
to greet your master
and other disciples.

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,880
They should be safe now.

52
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,559
How considerate of you.

53
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,320
Would you like to go with us, Mr. Yu?

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:10,960
Yes.

55
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:15,240
This way.

56
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,039
You should rest if you are injured.

57
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,679
Why are you out here?

58
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,839
I came to thank you.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,960
Well,

60
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:39,759
forget it.

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,880
Wait.

62
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,399
Give me.

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,360
Don't you want to thank me?

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,880
I, Bai Fengxi, am alone
and have nothing.

65
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,639
I'll just say thank you.

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,880
What do you want?

67
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,119
I should lower my expectations of you.

68
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:04,320
You're injured but cheerful.

69
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,880
The Soultaker Sect is weakened.

70
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,119
Why should I be sad?

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,919
Is that so?

72
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,199
Additionally,

73
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,720
I get to meet Mr. Yu,

74
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,320
the Finest Gentry.

75
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,640
I didn't expect to see

76
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,359
such an ethereal look in this world,

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,760
completely different
from the Black Foxy.

78
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,040
You scheme against everyone

79
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,600
but he is considerate to everyone.

80
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,160
By the way,

81
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,040
I'll meet him on Mount Tianzhi tomorrow.

82
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,239
Did you ask him out?

83
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,640
Why?

84
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,399
Why should I tell you?

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,600
I'm tired.

86
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll rest in my room.

87
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,640
(Why is Black Foxy acting weird today?)

88
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,600
Mr. Yu.

89
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,399
Greetings, Mr. Feng.

90
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,559
Please sit.

91
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,399
I'm surprised
that you are interested in this.

92
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,720
Are you buying it for your sweetheart?

93
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,959
Mr. Feng, pardon me.

94
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:19,760
I'm alone.

95
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,119
I don't have a sweetheart.

96
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
This reminds me

97
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,079
of a friend I met recently.

98
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,839
Although this pearl flower
is not a precious item,

99
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,320
it is simple and elegant.

100
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,959
A gift may be insignificant
but the feeling is deep.

101
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,600
You know this friend

102
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:39,679
better than I do.

103
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,359
After all, you were as famous as her
for the past decade.

104
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,320
Do you mean Bai Fengxi?

105
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
If it is her,

106
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,920
don't give this to her.

107
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,440
She'll definitely

108
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,040
trade it for wine.

109
00:05:58,799 --> 00:05:59,920
Indeed, Hei-Bai Fengxi

110
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,399
are equally famous,

111
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,160
and also know each other well.

112
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,519
Although Miss Feng and I

113
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,760
met only for a brief moment,

114
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,079
it is obvious

115
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,559
that she is a carefree person.

116
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,679
She does whatever pleases her.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,079
It seems that Mr. Yu

118
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,600
is her number-one confidant.

119
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,119
I don't deserve that.

120
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,720
Mr. Feng,

121
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,559
I must go to Mount Tianzhi.

122
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,799
Farewell.

123
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:28,239
Why can't Empyrean Yu Family live

124
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:31,200
as long as heaven?

125
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,440
Goodbye.

126
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:48,256
(Mount Tianzhi)

127
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,480
This song is elegant

128
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,239
and has an otherworldly beauty.

129
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:17,000
It makes me feel
as if I'm on Biluo Mountain,

130
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,119
picking flowers for food,

131
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,720
drinking the spring water,

132
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,359
picking fruit, teasing celestial deer,

133
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,320
walking on floating clouds,
and flirting with girls.

134
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,880
We are on Gaoshan Peak.
[*Gaoshan means mountain.]

135
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,720
This is the Liushui Pavilion.
[*Liushui means stream]

136
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,720
Only the stream understands

137
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,520
the sound of zither on the mountain.

138
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,520
What is the song's title?

139
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,919
It is untitled.

140
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,119
I played it impromptu,

141
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,159
based on how I feel now.

142
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,679
Based on how you feel?

143
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,599
That is not a common song.

144
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,520
Mr. Yu is indeed The Finest Gentry.

145
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,000
By the way,

146
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,039
thank you for the event

147
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,159
at King Ma's castle.

148
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:52,280
Miss Feng,

149
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,520
Huang Chao and I are good friends.

150
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,159
That event happened in Jizhou.

151
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,799
I must intervene.

152
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,880
I've informed

153
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,960
the Jizhou Defenders to protect
the Ma family

154
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,119
and track down the Soultaker Sect.

155
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,799
Miss Feng,

156
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:06,400
why did you ask me

157
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,840
to come here?

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,960
Huang Chao said

159
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,640
that you are the first person
he can't defeat,

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,080
and I'm only the second.

161
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:17,080
I

162
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,400
like to be second to none.

163
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
I am here today

164
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,640
to fight with you.

165
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,880
It looks like Mr. Feng is overthinking.

166
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,719
What does this have to do
with Black Foxy?

167
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,760
How do you want to compete?

168
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,280
Your body...

169
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,159
I'm fine.

170
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:34,400
We are friends.

171
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,679

your friend

227
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,640
sent someone to examine my father

228
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,119
and gave him some pills

229
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:54,119
that would help him recover.

230
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,200
That's good.

231
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,359
I examined my Master.

232
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,200
The toxin in his body is gone.

233
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,400
He will recover in a while.

234

Do not worry.

235
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,359
The world under the mountain is exciting.

There are so many awesome people.

237
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,039
No wonder you want to go down.

00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,760
Oh,

239
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,320
why did you ask Mr. Yu out today?

240
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,599
Of course, I invited The Finest Gentry

241
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,719
to a competition.

242

awesome!

244
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,359
However, Mr. Yu is handsome.

245
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,559
Don't you have other ideas about him?

246

247
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,640
listen.

248
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,400
There are many handsome men

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,440
in this world

250
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,479
besides this one.

251
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,719
So, do you like someone else?

252
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:38,719
Is it Hei Fengxi?

253

254
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,200

Do you feel better?

259
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:49,159
Much better.

260
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,280
The Soultaker Sect has been weakened.

261
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,400
The martial arts world is less chaotic.

262
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:54,880
Xi,

263
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,359
take your martial siblings
back to the Tianshuang Sect first.

264
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,119
Father, aren't you going back?

265
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,159
I have an old friend nearby.

266
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:03,679
I will visit him.

267
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:06,400
Master, you haven't recovered yet...

268
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,400
I'm fine.

269
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,520
Along the way,

270
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,559
you must take good care of them.

271
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,760
You'll temporarily handle
affairs of the sect.

272
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:15,520
Yes.

273
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:18,540
(Yongzhou)

274
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:25,919
Chief,

275
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,840
what does the edict

276
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,520
given at the court meeting

277
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,239
this morning by His Lordship mean?

278
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,840
Prince Chang joins
the Ministry of Civil Service Affairs,

279
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,359
the Second, the Ministry of Works,

280
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,359
and the Third, the Ministry of Revenue,
as advisers.

281
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,080
Isn't it obvious?

282
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,559
His Lordship will assess
the three princes.

283
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,599
One is the eldest,
one is from the first wife,

284
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,080
and another's mother is now the queen.

285
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,200
Therefore,

286
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,479
they will be judged on who is virtuous.

287
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,640
The Ministry of Works is a tough job.

288
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,640
Prince Ju's Ministry of Revenue

289
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,400
is a good place.

290
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,119
Does His Lordship
value the Prince Ju more?

291
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:03,159
Heaven is about to place
a great responsibility on a great man.

292
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,159
Should we...

293
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,239
Visit the Prince Lanxi's residence.

294
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,200
All right.

295
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,202
(Pavilion of Noble Characters)

296
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:13,200
Congratulations, Your Highness.

297
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:15,559
Vice Minister of Works, Official Liu

298
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,200
seems to be from your Feng Family.

299
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,000
Before dark tonight,

300
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,479
he will send the relevant files

301
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,880
to your residence.

302
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,000
Talking to smart people

303
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,080
saves me trouble.

304
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,200
Prince Ju chose the Ministry of Revenue,

305
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,400
thinking that his plan succeeded.

306
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,520
Unfortunately,

307
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:32,320
The Minister of Revenue, Baili,
is his maternal uncle.

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,159
Even if he performs well,

309
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,320
he won't get the credit,

310
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,159
but if something goes wrong,

311
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,880
he will bring shame to the Baili Family.

312
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,679
I have people in the Ministries
of Revenue and Civil Service Affairs.

313
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:43,960
Your Highness, if you want...

314
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,599
No.

315
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,359
That's too obvious.

316
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,400
On the contrary,

317
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,119
I would like Minister Feng

318
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,159
to help my elder brother when you can.

319
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,280
Is it because the late queen

320
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,880
raised Prince Chang for some time,

321
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,239
and Your Highness
has brotherly love for him?

322
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:02,119
Mistakes are costly in the competition
to be the heir of Lord.

323
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,840
When I was a child,

324
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,000
my elder brother took good care of me.

325
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,640
No matter how fierce the competition is,

326
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,840
he will always be my elder brother.

327
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,840
I only have to target

328
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,599
Feng Ju.

329
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,239
I congratulate Your Highness

330
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,359
on a great future
in the Ministry of Works.

331
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,280
If I excel,

332
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,320
my father may not be pleased.

333
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,119
But don't worry.

334
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,559
You will be the first one to know about

335
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:32,080
future developments in the royal court.

336
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,080
Thank you for your trust in me.

337
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:38,546
(Yongzhou)

338
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,159
Your Highness! Your Highness!

339
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,119
It is finally here.

340
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,919
Get the vice ministers and directors.
Follow me.

341
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:51,559
Yes.

342
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,080
(Lanxi, Lanxi,)

343
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,119
(do you know why I chose
the Ministry of Revenue?)

344
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,799
(So what if you beat me
in the autumn hunt?)

345
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,679
(This time, it's my turn.)

346
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,960
The earthwork measurements

347
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
have basically been done.

348
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,520
Lastly,

349
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
we mainly should

350
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:13,440
improve this vertical column.

351
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:16,440
Your Highness!

352
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:18,200
Prince Ju rushed in with his officials

353
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,719
to audit us by the lord's order.

354
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,039
What? Auditing?

355
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,159
Ju will not come for no reason.

356
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,280
Minister Zheng,

357
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:29,840
is there an accounting discrepancy

358
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,200
in our ministry?

359
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,719
(Minister of Works of Yongzhou, Zheng Kui)
The account...

360
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,200
If you don't talk
and it is revealed to my father,

361
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:40,719
I can't protect you.

362
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:43,960
Your Highness, save me!

363
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,440
A hailstorm last year

364
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,719
damaged our Xuncheng
city wall construction.

365
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
For fear of punishment,

366
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:51,799
I

367
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:52,919
had to

368
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
appropriate 500,000 silver leaves.

369
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,200
I thought we'd pay it back
in these two months.

370
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,719
I didn't expect...

371
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:58,520
Which money?

372
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,119
Money for the royal mausoleum
after the lord's passing.

373
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,160
Today, Prince Ju

374
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,040
will audit the Ministry of Works.

375
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,319
Unlock these.

376
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:19,400
Do you hear me? Open the locks!

377
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,160
Stop.

378
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,199
Lanxi, you're here.

379
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,839
You are well.

380
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:40,719
How dare you

381
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,839
trespass into our restricted area?

382
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,160
Feng Ju,

383
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,319
do you respect me?

384
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,079
Lanxi, I won't dare
trespass into the Ministry of Works.

385
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,839
Yesterday, I went to the palace

386
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,079
and Father said that

387
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,719
the ledgers of the three provinces
and six ministries

388
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:56,839
have inconsistencies lately.

389
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,199
He asked me to check.

390
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,079
Don't get angry.

391
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,079
The ministries' accounts

392
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:04,560
are always audited on year-ends.

393
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,520
You can check

394
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,880
if you have Father's handwritten order.

395
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,079
Otherwise,

396
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:11,400
I'll kill without mercy.

397
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Lanxi, you are sickly.

398
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,439
Don't resort to fighting all the time.

399
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,680
These are royal court officials.

400
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,040
If you kill them,

401
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,400
the censorates and supervising secretary
might report you.

402
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:25,880
Moreover...

403
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,359
Isn't Father's oral instruction
a decree also?

404
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:30,839
Disobeying a decree is a heinous crime.

405
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,199
Keep checking.

406
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:34,160
I'll be responsible
for any trouble caused.

407
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,040
Check! Come!

408
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,719
Keep checking!

409
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,199
Open them.

410
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,959
Are you disobeying the lord's order?

411
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,479
Lanxi,

412
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,920
where is the silver in the warehouse?

413
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,199
Your Highness, we found it.

414
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,040
On the 15th, 500,000 silver leaves
were withdrawn.

415
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:20,079
How do you explain this expenditure?

416
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,160
This...

417
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,199
How dare you?

418
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,439
Our father ordered you
to supervise the Ministry of Works.

419
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,359
Is that how you do it?

420
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,040
He only ordered us
to assist the six ministries.

421
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,160
Besides, I have only been here
for ten days.

422
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:35,959
What do I know?

423
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,839
It seems that someone
is denying all responsibilities.

424
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,239
Minister Zheng,

425
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,040
you followed the wrong person.

426
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,280
Lanxi,

427
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,079
embezzling silver
for the royal mausoleum is a grave sin.

428
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,920
Without your permission,

429
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,439
the officials here

430
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,359
won't dare do anything

431
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,199
even if you kill them.

432
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,800
No wonder you made all kinds of excuses

433
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,959
to prevent us from auditing.

434
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,959
Follow me to the palace

435
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,439
and report this to Father.

436
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,680
Did the ministry
misappropriate the silver?

437
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,160
Lanxi,

438
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,439
we have ironclad proof. Don't argue.

439
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,839
Ju, you made a lot of guesses.

440
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,439
I don't get it.

441
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,959
Why did you suddenly affix my crime?

442
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:25,359
This...

443
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,320
(Dadong Banknote)

444
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,000
Father's silver for the royal mausoleum

445
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,839
(Dadong Banknote)
is kept nicely here.

446
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,280
How can there be misappropriations?

447
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:55,719
That...

448
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:58,160
What's the explanation
for the expenditure?

449
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,079
There are many silver leaves.

450
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,680
We convert them
into silver notes for safekeeping.

451
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,880
However, some villains
with wild ambitions

452
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,640
capitalized on this to frame us.

453
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,040
Minister Zheng,

454
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,400
did Ju say

455
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
that my father orally instructed him
to audit us?

456
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,640
Yes or no?

457
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,239
Yes, we heard it with our own ears.

458
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,359
Good.

459
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,959
Zhong Li, bring my seal to the palace.

460
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,239
Ask the Eunuch Director of Brush-Writing
to check the residence note

461
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,359
to see if my father gave
an oral instruction yesterday.

462
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,199
Yes.

463
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:35,719
Wait.

464
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:42,680
Lanxi,

465
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,280
I must have made a mistake.

466
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,439
This is a misunderstanding.

467
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,599
Misunderstanding.

468
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,599
Misunderstanding?

469
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,079
The misunderstanding is
punishable by beheading.

470
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,479
Do you want our lives?

471
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:57,599
I don't think I need the residence note.

472
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,640
I'll visit His Lordship at the palace.

473
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,520
I will thoroughly clean

474
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,119
this pot of dirty water that is poured

475
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,119
on the ministry.

476
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,640
Your Highness,

477
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,760
should we go together?

478
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,199
Please, Minister Zheng.

479
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,839
This...

480
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,599
Your Highness, thank you
for the foresight.

481
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,239
You saved the ministry from a disaster.

482
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,680
Don't be polite, Official Zheng.

483
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,880
I helped you to help myself.

484
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,959
Why does Your Highness carry

485
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,280
silver notes in this amount with you?

486
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,479
I'm an idiot.

487
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,199
Your eyes are like burning torches

488
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:44,560
and you have foresight.

489
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,959
Prince Ju was arrogant and reckless.

490
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,599
He faked the lord's order

491
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:53,760
and affixed a crime.

492
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,199
He is malicious

493
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,079
and guilty.

494
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,160
If this continues,

495
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,439
the country will be in peril.

496
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,599
Rascal!

497
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,400
This kid

498
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,359
got into such big trouble

499
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,239
but is still hiding.

500
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:10,719
Xi,

501
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,479
you oversee the ministry by proxy

502
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:14,359
and are also a victim.

503
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:15,640
In your opinion,

504
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,839
how should Feng Ju be punished?

505
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,520
He is young

506
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,119
and makes mistakes.

507
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:22,560
It is inevitable.

508
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:24,119
I think

509
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,319
that a small punishment is enough.

510
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:30,280
However, Minister of Revenue Baili

511
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
can't be let off lightly.

512
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:32,239
First,

513
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,439
he heads the ministry

514
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,839
but connives with officials

515
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,839
to fight with another ministry.
This is a dereliction of duty.

516
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,959
Second,

517
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,599
he is Ju's maternal uncle.

518
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:41,959
He would have known

519
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,439
that embezzling the silver for mausoleum
is a serious crime.

520
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,400
He let the rumor

521
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,439
get into Ju's ears.

522
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,199
Does he have an ulterior motive?

523
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,319
Father,

524
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,119
Ju and I are blood relatives,

525
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,239
but one is the son of the first queen

526
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,560
and the other,
the son of the second queen.

527
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,079
What is Minister Baili's motive

528
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,040
for alienating us?

529
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:07,280
What Prince Lanxi said is very true.

530
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,880
Your Lordship,

531
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,479
Minister Baili should be severely
punished for dereliction of duty.

532
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:14,160
I second.

533
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,040
I second.

534
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,880
I second.

535
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,439
Relay my decree.

536
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,280
Minister of Revenue Baili Heng

537
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,359
is incompetent, lets rumors spread,

538
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
and is reckless.

539
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:34,400
He is demoted three grades

540
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,479
to the governor of Jiangzhou.

541
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:39,520
Feng Ju had oversight
and made false remarks.

542
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,000
He'll leave the ministry,

543
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,880
reflect on what he did

544
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,439
and be fined 5,000 pieces of silver.

545
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,280
How is that?

546
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,880
I respectfully accept

547
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:49,280
Father's wise judgment.

548
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,560
What I did today

549
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,839
is to consolidate your territory forever.

550
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:55,560
I have no other intention.

551
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:56,920
Father,

552
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,079
the Lianjiang river is swollen.

553
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,000
Father, with your permission,
let me bring the directors

554
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,160
of the ministry to Decheng to survey

555
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,160
the dyke repair work.

556
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,160
Xi,

557
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,920
you worry about national affairs
on my behalf.

558
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,719
That is a great kindness.

559
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,959
Go.

560
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,040
Yes, Father.

561
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,439
The Prince Lanxi made a good move.

562
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,479
Yes.

563
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,800
Seeing that His Lordship
intended to protect Prince Ju,

564
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,719
he let him go lightly

565
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,359
and turned around to target
the maternal uncle Baili.

566
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,680
The reflection and demotion

567
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:36,719
will severely weaken

568
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,000
the queen's faction.

569
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,439
Not only that,

570
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,599
do you remember what he said just now?

571
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,400
He said he is the legitimate son
of the first queen

572
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,439
and Prince Ju is the son
of the second queen.

573
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,520
The distinction in status

574
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,199
is clear.

575
00:25:57,439 --> 00:26:01,239
He capitalized on his position
as the first queen's eldest son.

576
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,319
That's why Prince Lanxi
asked to go to Decheng.

577
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,400
Think about it.

578
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,640
If he stays in the capital,

579
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,280
and ministers at the court meeting

580
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:14,599
tomorrow morning learn that
Prince Ju was demoted,

581
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,119
surely someone will suggest

582
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,800
naming Prince Lanxi
as the heir of Lord.

583
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,800
However, he himself has gone to Decheng.

584
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,920
How can they confer that title?

585
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,000
Prince Lanxi is sick all the time.

586
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,560
He has just recovered

587
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,319
but shows such shrewdness.

588
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:39,280
The climate in the royal court

589
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:42,239
might change.

590
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,040
Is he sick all the time

591
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,880
or keeping a low profile?

592
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,520
This...

593
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:50,499
We don't know.

594
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,781
(Feng Ju's Residence, Yongzhou)

595
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,079
Darn Feng Lanxi!

596
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,560
He got me again!

597
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,640
I think

598
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,439
Vice Minister Liu visited his residence.

599
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:08,479
He already knew.

600
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,839
Obviously, Prince Lanxi is suppressing you.

601
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,239
That was why he hatched that plan.

602
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,760
Your Highness,

603
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:16,880
this is the crime of treason.

604
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:18,959
He's going to kill you.

605
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,839
Fortunately, His Lordship loves you.

606
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:22,760
Otherwise...

607
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,040
I won't rest

608
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,160
until I avenge this.

609
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:38,760
Your Highness,

610
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,880
thankfully Vice Minister Liu

611
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,079
informed you, and you were prepared.

612
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,400
Prince Ju

613
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
shot himself in the foot and might not

614
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,400
resign to it.

615
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,119
He might take action.

616
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,680
That's his business.

617
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,280
Forget this issue.

618
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,079
We have a flood emergency.

619
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,719
Let's handle it first.

620
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:58,880
Yes.

621
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:14,160
Why didn't you tell me
that you're targeting Feng Ju?

622
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,640
You should let me see

623
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,400
his wretched look.

624
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,479
When did I target him?

625
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:23,160
He made things difficult for me.

626
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,400
There are no outsiders here.

627
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,839
You don't have to lie to me.

628
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,719
Had he not targeted me,

629
00:28:33,438 --> 00:28:34,680
would he get into trouble?

630
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:49,267
(Lianjiang, Yongzhou)

631
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,520
Martial Sister,

632
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,479
are you still nauseous after so long?

633
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,319
Didn't you travel the waterways before?

634
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,959
I did,

635
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,719
but Lianjiang has three feet waves
on windless days.

636
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:09,160
Martial Sister, come and smell this.

637
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,199
What's this?

638
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,199
Oil from lamp roasted tangerine peel.

639
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,119
Good for nausea.

640
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,439
Jiurong, you know how to please her.

641
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,800
We vomited two days ago.

642
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,640
Why didn't you take it out?

643
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,959
You just know...

644
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,920
Master went out

645
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,880
and handed the Tianshuang Sect
to Martial Sister.

646
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,760
Maybe later

647
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,959
he'll make her Sect Leader.

648
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,319
Don't say that again.

649
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,000
Martial Sister, what do you want to eat?

650
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,040
I can cook.

651
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,680
Anything.

652
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,599
All right.

653
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,130
(Yong)

654
00:29:53,732 --> 00:29:54,332
(Yong)

655
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,280
A hundred li downstream from here,

656
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,760
Lianjiang River flows into a steep gorge

657
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,280
with narrow passageways.

658
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,359
Therefore,

659
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,959
any storm upstream will whip up

660
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:05,760
strong winds and huge waves here.

661
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:10,319
Vice Minister Liu, thank you for
harnessing the river these years.

662
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,040
Your Highness came here in person
without fear of danger.

663
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,040
I admire you.

664
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,959
If this goes on,

665
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,839
the storm will intensify soon.

666
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:20,920
Your Highness,

667
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,119
let's turn back.

668
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,119
Lower the sails.

669
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,040
Your Highness.

670
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,199
Are you all right?

671
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:32,800
I'm fine.

672
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,680
Someone is down there!

673
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:02,839
Archers!

674
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,119
Archers, quick!

675
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,079
Hurry!

676
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,239
Check the bilge!

677
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:06,560
Yes!

678
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:09,760
Move!

679
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,079
Your Highness!

680
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:43,880
Bad news!

681
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,880
The cabin is flooded!

682
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,040
Move it up!

683
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,800
Men, come with me!

684
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,239
All right.

685
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,400
Come quickly! Come quickly!

686
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:25,880
What's the hurry to get me
out of the capital to relax?

687
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,079
What happened?

688
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,680
What?

689
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,079
How is he now?

690
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,800
We just received reliable information

691
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,439
that Prince Lanxi is missing.

692
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,079
It's stormy there.

693
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:39,719
I am afraid...

694
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,239
Are you crazy?

695
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:45,880
How could you act on your own?

696
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,640
Since the Ministry of Revenue's debacle,

697
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:48,959
you have been unhappy.

698
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,719
A lord's worry
is a servant's humiliation.

699
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:51,599
Therefore, I...

700
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,839
I...

701
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,439
No matter how hard we fight,

702
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,599
I never thought of taking his life.

703
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,599
He is my second brother
and related by blood.

704
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:01,719
Your Highness,

705
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:02,959
to vie for supremacy,

706
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,760
you cannot show a woman's kindness.

707
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,239
You!

708
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:08,840
I know

709
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,600
it is treason
to murder the royal family.

710
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,959
I acted on my own responsibility.

711
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,439
I hope Your Highness
will make the country prosperous

712
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,560
so that my loyalty is not wasted.

713
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,320
Enough!

714
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:19,600
Stand up.

715
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:20,840
Stand up!

716
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,439
Stand up.

717
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,120
Stand up.

718
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,159
Go back now.

719
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,120
All right.

720
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,320
The immediate priority

721
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:29,959
is not to make my father suspicious.

722
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:31,360
Yes. Your Highness, don't worry.

723
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,719
I've made arrangements.

724
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:34,120
He won't suspect you.

725
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:36,360
It's true.

726
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,879
Your Highness.

727
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,959
Your Highness!

728
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,560
Ren Chuanyu! Ren Chuanyu!

729
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,439
Wake up quickly.

730
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,800
Wake up!

731
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,959
What are you looking at?

732
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:50,639
Locate His Highness quickly! Hurry!

733
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,840
Yes. Yes.

734
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,080
Quickly.

735
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:54,280
Ren Chuanyu.

736
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,520
- Your Highness.
- Wake up.

737
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:55,840
Your Highness.

738
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,479
Your Highness.

739
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,239
Official Liu,

740
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,919
where's His Highness?

741
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,399
Did you rescue him?

742
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,760
We didn't find him.

743
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,280
Save him quickly.

744
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,360
He is afraid of water.

745
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,919
His Highness is afraid of water!

746
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:14,879
Calm down, your lordship.

747
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,479
Decheng has mobilized all troops
to search for His Highness.

748
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,159
Heaven blesses the good man.

749
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:19,879
Enough!

750
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,199
Who did this?

751
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:26,120
Minister Wang sent people
to investigate this morning.

752
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,719
What about Feng Ju?

753
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,040
The servants said

754
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,479
that Prince Ju
has been in his residence.

755
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,399
Relay my decree.

756
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:34,120
Find Xi at all costs.

757
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:34,840
Yes.

758
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,600
Go if you want.

759
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,439
Don't intervene.

760
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,399
Are you angry

761
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:18,320
about what Jiurong did for me today?

762
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,959
No.

763
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,320
It's written on your face.

764
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:25,000
I saved Jiurong

765
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and he is nice to me

766
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,280
because he is grateful.

767
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:29,320
Don't you like him because of

768
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,120
what he is?

769
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,919
Who said I like him?

770
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,639
No.

771
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:38,639
Do you know why
we don't journey overland?

772
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,639
Traveling by land to Tianshuang Sect
is faster

773
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:42,159
but we chose to go by water.

774
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,760
You have the say.

775
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,919
No one knows what you think.

776
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,719
Jiurong begged me to do that.

777
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,000
He told me

778
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,639
that you hadn't gotten out for so long

779
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,919
and wanted you to see more
and stay longer.

780
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
Do you think I've lost my mind

781
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,040
and chosen such a torturing path?

782
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:02,679
Did he say that?

783
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,840
Would I lie?

784
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,399
Go ahead and give him the clothes

785
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,239
whether he likes them or not.

786
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:13,639
You'll find out that way.

787
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,760
Moreover,

788
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
people in the martial arts world
like us should act cool.

789
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,320
Right?

790
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,280
There's someone.

791
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,800
Someone is in the river. Save him!

792
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,320
There's no time. Jiurong, get a rope!

793
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:57,840
Yes.

794
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,719
Martial Sister, be careful!

795
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,679
Martial Sister!

796
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,840
(The Black Foxy
should fall into the water.)

797
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:18,840
(An accident must have happened.)

798
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,439
Drowning in the cold water
will damage his lungs and veins.

799
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:54,840
Don't leave me,

800
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,679
Mother.

801
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,439
Martial Sister, here's the medicine.

802
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,439
Help him up.

803
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:42,320
Quick.

804
00:39:56,399 --> 00:39:57,560
You must take the medicine.

805
00:39:58,439 --> 00:39:59,120
Black Foxy.

806
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,159
Martial Sister, be gentler.

807
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:02,560
He is not well.

808
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:06,800
I was anxious.
