What's your relationship
with the Yu family?

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,839
The Yu family?

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,839
The Yu family

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,599
of the Imperial City

24
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,000
requested me
to make this jade pendant long ago.

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,839
However, the people of
the Empyrean Yu family

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,879
all have short lives.

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,120
I don't know

28
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,959
if they're still alive by now.

29
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,599
Mister, are you sure about this?

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,720
Naturally.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,239
I am the only person

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,879
who knows how to do such engravings.

33
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:09,960
(The Yu family of the Imperial City)

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,240
(and the Empyrean Yu family?)

35
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,440
(Could it be him?)

36
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,898
(Phoenix Palace, Yongzhou)

37
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,839
(Phoenix Palace, Yongzhou)
Now that Feng Lanxi left for Youzhou,

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,240
I'm sure you know what this means.

39
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,559
Yes, I do.

40
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,720
Although Feng Lanxi's fall from grace

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,600
is quite set in stone,

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,119
matters can change suddenly.

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,639
It's best if you secure

44
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,199
the Heir title as soon as possible.

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
However, Father

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,119
is still mad

47
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,240
at Feng Lanxi.

48
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,720
How should I...

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,880
Your father's birthday is in two months.

50
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,520
Noted.

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,720
His birthday is my opportunity.

52
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,639
We are being tailed.

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,479
Why don't we get rid of them?

54
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,440
My father won't just send some officials

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,759
to monitor me.

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,199
They

57
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:14,360
are the real agents
sent to monitor my movement.

58
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,880
They will follow us
during the whole trip

59
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,080
and report to my father what we do

60
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,399
in Youzhou.

61
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,679
Only that

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,240
can put my father's mind to rest.

63
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,440
Let them tail us.

64
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,000
What is your plan?

65
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,119
Enter the Royal Palace of Youzhou.

66
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,839
Now?

67
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,919
We still have ten days until
the day of the marriage proposal.

68
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,839
Fountain Abode got this intel.

69
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,520
It's the list of suitors
for the royal marriage proposal

70
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,440
and its rules.

71
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,039
Putting myself in my father's shoes,

72
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,160
he doesn't want me to marry
the Princess of Youzhou.

73
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,399
If I have Youzhou's support,

74
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,279
I will have the necessary force
for a comeback.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,759
But he doesn't want me to lose badly

76
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,160
to bring shame to Yongzhou either.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,079
Meanwhile,

78
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,399
he also wants to see

79
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,880
how useful I can be
without my martial arts.

80
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Most importantly,

81
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:24,279
he wants to know

82
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,720
if I can read his mind.

83
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,600
I was sent to Youzhou

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,320
to ask for the princess's hand.

85
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,359
But in fact, it's a trial
from my father.

86
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:35,679
A trial

87
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,519
of loyalty.

88
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,440
Only by proving my ability and loyalty

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,079
will my father be satisfied.

90
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,880
Master Bai and others

91
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,720
will be released then.

92
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
Everyone

93
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,040
in politics has their own agenda.

94
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,839
A marriage proposal
to the Youzhou Princess

95
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,519
can put these many things

96
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,320
at stake.

97
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,279
I have read through it.

98
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,600
As expected
from the greatest beauty of Dadong,

99
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,880
the candidates are
all important and powerful figures.

100
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,399
However, the first stage is a spar.

101
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,799
If you had your martial arts,

102
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,480
you would blaze through it.

103
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,760
But now,

104
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,320
we need to play it smart.

105
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,079
I suppose what you're trying to do

106
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:16,399
is to enter the Royal Palace and
approach Hua Chunran.

107
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,040
Yes.

108
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,720
I even prepared a huge gift

109
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,200
for her.

110
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,760
Catch the ringleader first.

111
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:26,760
You're smart.

112
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,640
However, she isn't

113
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,279
just the Dadong's greatest beauty.

114
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:31,679
I heard

115
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
she also has some power

116
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,320
over Youzhou's royal court.

117
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,959
Knowing that,

118
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,480
if we befriend her,

119
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,079
she can help us out.

120
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,519
The spar will be a non-issue.

121
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Her delivering the sarira

122
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,839
also shows that she is very smart.

123
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,359
Gaining her trust

124
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,040
will not be easy.

125
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,959
Not only is she smart,

126
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,640
but she is also vigilant.

127
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,320
After she delivered the sarira
to the Imperial City,

128
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,320
many went after her head.

129
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,679
However, she predicted that

130
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,160
and managed to cheat death
several times.

131
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,720
So someone like her

132
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,959
is very vigilant,

133
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,440
unless...

134
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,480
Unless she is with someone who doesn't
have a conflict of interest with her.

135
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,440
And that someone has to be amicable,

136
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,359
has to get along with her well,

137
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,320
has to retain her interest,

138
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,480
and has to be a woman, preferably.

139
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:16,600
Like...

140
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,720
Me.

141
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,720
Only you can do that.

142
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,519
You're bold,

143
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,239
which is a rare sight in this world.

144
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,679
If Feng Qiwu finds you interesting,

145
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,200
Hua Chunran will too.

146
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,239
I know you're worried

147
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,320
about the safety of Master Bai
and the Tianshuang Sect.

148
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,160
I won't force you.

149
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:38,679
Before I come to Youzhou,

150
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,799
Master already told me

151
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,839
to follow my heart.

152
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,079
Do not be consumed by grief.

153
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,519
I mulled it over during our trip.

154
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,079
My Master and others are
in the capital of Yongzhou.

155
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,519
They are safe for the moment.

156
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,640
Besides,

157
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,239
Qiwu and others are looking after them.

158
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,559
Since this is how things turned out,

159
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,640
why not get back on my feet,

160
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,720
move on,

161
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,720
and help you.

162
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,959
That way, they will be freed sooner.

163
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,799
Look at you, Your Highness.

164
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,480
The greatest beauty of Dadong
is an understatement.

165
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,559
In my opinion,

166
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,799
you are the greatest beauty
in the world.

167
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:16,959
Of course, she is.

168
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,119
I heard all inns are fully booked

169
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:21,000
because Her Highness
is looking for a suitor.

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,920
I even heard

171
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,720
that several gentlemen fought.

172
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,239
All officials are even busier
than before.

173
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,399
Who can resist the charm
of Her Highness?

174
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,880
Your Highness,

175
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,279
do tell us.

176
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,160
Is there someone
that tickles your fancy?

177
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,480
I heard, the heir of Lord of Jizhou,
Huang Chao, is a fine man.

178
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:41,600
He is the most popular one
among the suitors who arrived.

179
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,399
As for the newly-arrived
Prince Yongping of Yongzhou,

180
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:47,440
I heard he's also elegant
and charismatic.

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,119
Feng Lanxi is here?

182
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,200
He just arrived.

183
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,839
Huang Chao and Feng Lanxi

184
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,000
are two of the Four Gentry.

185
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,959
His Lordship wishes to dine with you
in Xiaoyun Pavilion today.

186
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,559
Noted.

187
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,239
I'll head to Mingse Garden first.

188
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,839
That Snowy Ink plant
was budding yesterday.

189
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,760
It might have bloomed today.

190
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,239
No need to follow me.

191
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,119
Yes, Your Highness.

192
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,880
So an otherworldly beauty

193
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,880
like you exists in this world.

194
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,760
They say the Chinese peony
is the Monarch of Flower.

195
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,359
But you are even more beautiful than it.

196
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,359
A beauty

197
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,719
has the appearance of a flower,
the grace of the moon,

198
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,200
the demeanor of a willow,
the resilience of jade,

199
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,159
the fairness of the snow,
and the calmness of the autumn water.

200
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,080
You are the embodiment of them.

201
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,280
If I'm not mistaken,

202
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:58,799
you two must be
the renowned Hei-Bai Fengxi.

203
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,159
You have keen observation,
the beauty of Dadong.

204
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,479
Although you stay
in the Royal Palace mostly,

205
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:04,919
you know what's happening in the world.

206
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,280
I beg to differ.

207
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,960
The two of you are simply too famous,

208
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:11,119
especially the owner of Fountain Abode,

209
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,559
Mr. Feng, Hei Fengxi.

210
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,960
Your reputation precedes you.

211
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:18,559
May I know

212
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,479
why this unannounced visit?

213
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,919
For the marriage proposal.

214
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,880
We're here for the fun.

215
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,520
However, upon our arrival,

216
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,960
all inns and relay stations

217
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
are fully booked.

218
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,760
I don't like to leave without anything

219
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,400
so I came here to find you.

220
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,039
In that case,

221
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,719
it is my fault then.

222
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,799
Your Highness, you have the generosity

223
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,760
to take the joke lightly
instead of taking offense to it.

224
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
I admire your attitude.

225
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,880
You exaggerate.

226
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,640
If you don't mind,

227
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,400
you can stay in Luohua Palace.

228
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,719
Since I spend most of my time
within the Royal Palace,

229
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,359
I am curious
about the martial arts world.

230
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,000
Your Highness, you do not

231
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,520
speak from your high horse.

232
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,719
For that, I am thankful.

233
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,520
Here's a token of appreciation

234
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,280
from Fountain Abode.

235
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,559
A gift?

236
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,039
Your Highness, are you waiting for
two criminals to be delivered to you?

237
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,559
Someone tried to kill them

238
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,479
and I was there at the time.

239
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,760
I intervened.

240
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,119
They are now outside of the city.

241
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,000
This is the testimony they signed.

242
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,200
(A noble Mister with his two servants
asked me and my son to drug Divine Fairy)

243
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,140
(and kill her on her way
back to the capital of Youzhou.)

244
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,640
Fountain Abode knows everything.

245
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,000
That isn't hearsay, I see.

246
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:34,000
You are even aware
of the classified matters

247
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,880
on the heir of Lord of Youzhou.

248
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:39,000
What do you seek, Mr. Feng?

249
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,359
Don't get us wrong, Your Highness.

250
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,479
We just want to be your friends.

251
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,799
Take it as a small present.

252
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,280
Your Highness,
you will be like this Chinese peony,

253
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,520
beautiful and regal.

254
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,960
I am willing to serve you

255
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,479
and help you ascend to the throne.

256
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,640
I appreciate

257
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,000
your proposition.

258
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,479
My father wishes to have lunch with me.

259
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,520
I shall take my leave now.

260
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:06,039
Follow this path to reach Luohua Palace.

261
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,200
I will return
to be a gracious host later

262
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,799
and we will talk with candor.

263
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,799
Thanks, Your Highness.

264
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:13,039
Many thanks.

265
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:27,679
Come.

266
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,919
Cheers.

267
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,400
Enjoy the lunch, my children.

268
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,359
Come.

269
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,440
Chun,

270
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,239
you're back for more than two weeks.

271
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,119
Are you feeling better now?

272
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,559
Father,

273
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,159
I am fine now.

274
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,039
It's just

275
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,159
that I went to Mingse Garden today

276
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,280
and those flowers in bloom

277
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:55,000
reminded me of Hong.

278
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,159
My heart aches.

279
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,200
She sacrificed herself
to save her master.

280
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,159
I will make sure her family
is handsomely rewarded.

281
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,719
Thanks, Father.

282
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,520
However, I want to take revenge.

283
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,799
A few days ago,

284
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,159
I sent someone to Decheng

285
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,559
to capture the duo who killed Hong.

286
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,799
Good.

287
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,799
Behead them then.

288
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,559
I already did.

289
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,679
However...

290
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,119
I received a missive

291
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,039
filled with the signed testimonies

292
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,359
of those two criminals.

293
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:27,200
They said...

294
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,919
What did they say?

295
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,799
They said they were sent by Chunyuan.

296
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:35,640
- Father!
- Father,

297
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,559
do not walk into their trap.

298
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,679
I already destroyed the missive.

299
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Besides, Chunyuan has been nothing
but kind to me.

300
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,799
He wouldn't do something like that.

301
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm sure those two criminals framed him

302
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,200
out of desperation.

303
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,919
Father, I did no such a thing.

304
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,760
It's all my fault.

305
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,479
Sorry for making you worry, Father.

306
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,559
It's okay.

307
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,280
I will definitely investigate

308
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,280
the assassination attempt on you.

309
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,359
Don't worry.

310
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,760
Enjoy the meal.

311
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,520
Chunyuan,

312
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:13,440
you should

313
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,520
be kinder to your sister.

314
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,880
Otherwise, these rumors will affect

315
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,919
my impression of you.

316
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,359
Being my heir

317
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,719
is not easy.

318
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,760
Of course, Father.

319
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,799
Here.

320
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,119
Thanks, Father.

321
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:31,559
Enjoy.

322
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,239
Here.

323
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,280
Have some.

324
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,280
She didn't use the letter you gave her.

325
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,479
She did,

326
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,640
in a better way.

327
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,880
What she did

328
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,280
not only put the heir of Lord of Youzhou
in a difficult spot

329
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,880
but also reinforced her image

330
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,880
as a vulnerable and innocent victim.

331
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,679
So manipulative.

332
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,200
That's the beauty, Princess Hua.

333
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,520
She's a clever woman

334
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,440
who can play her feminine cards well.

335
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,799
She's

336
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,719
tougher to crack than imagined.

337
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,000
You...

338
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:10,719
Don't worry about me.

339
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,840
Those who keep to themselves a lot

340
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,039
will feel lonely.

341
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,640
And those who feel lonely
want to make friends.

342
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,239
And I

343
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,640
am good at making friends.

344
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,799
What is your plan?

345
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:25,080
I'll try to get to know her.

346
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,159
I'll start with her maids.

347
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,719
Right.

348
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,239
I'm sure

349
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,719
you can get along with them

350
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,679
very soon.

351
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:35,719
I will also find ways

352
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:37,239
to approach her.

353
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,919
Hei-Bai Fengxi

354
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,760
seem to keep

355
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,200
a

356
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,760
low profile.

357
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,599
I'm sure he has a backup plan.

358
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:55,239
Maybe Youzhou

359
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,960
is his backup plan.

360
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,239
What about others?

361
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:00,919
They are not my concerns.

362
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,400
My only opponent is him.

363
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,760
The clairvoyant, Yue Qingyan,

364
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,119
once commented on the Four Gentry.

365
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,760
Pacifist Yu, Graceful Lan,

366
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,400
Arrogant Huang, Hidden Xi.

367
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,760
Pacifist and Arrogant
are easy to understand.

368
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,239
As for Hidden,

369
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,159
once I learn that Feng Lanxi
is Hei Fengxi,

370
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,400
I get that too.

371
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,080
But Graceful is quite hard to decipher.

372
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,679
How can gracefulness

373
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,880
command

374
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,039
reverence?

375
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
When Hidden and Graceful

376
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,359
are paired together,

377
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,479
it makes him more enigmatic.

378
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,440
I actually want to meet him.

379
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,039
But...

380
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,119
But for your ambition's sake,

381
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,320
it's best if he will never
interfere in politics.

382
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,760
Whether he will

383
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,559
or not,

384
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,719
no one can stand in my way

385
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,520
to the Imperial City.

386
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:52,719
Oh.

387
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,919
Tomorrow,

388
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,520
Lord of Youzhou wants me
in the Royal Palace.

389
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,000
All the best then.

390
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,000
Sir.

391
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:07,719
Feng Lanxi and Bai Fengxi

392
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,000
are in the Royal Palace.

393
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,359
Smart.

394
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,760
They take advantage of the princess.

395
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,080
Your Highness,

396
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,119
perhaps you could talk to Miss Feng?

397
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,840
Lately,

398
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,200
all she has been doing

399
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,520
is eating, playing, and sleeping.

400
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,760
She spends most of her days

401
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,160
napping and eating,

402
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,079
and for the rest of her days,

403
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,239
she plays with the maids.

404
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,719
Do not talk behind Miss Feng's back.

405
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,239
But she's like this.

406
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,680
Besides,

407
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,560
she keeps pulling pranks.

408
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,680
For example,

409
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,199
she would sneak up behind you

410
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,520
and appear suddenly,

411
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
giving you a scare.

412
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,959
But then she would also

413
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
pull a beautiful flower out of nowhere
and put it on you.

414
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,640
She would then tell you you're pretty.

415
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,319
As expected from Bai Fengxi.

416
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,119
I truly admire

417
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,319
Miss Feng's character.

418
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,839
If you have Miss Feng as your friend,

419
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,760
your life will be full of laughter.

420
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,239
Dismissed.

421
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,199
Miss Feng should be free in the palace.

422
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,199
Do not restrain her.

423
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,760
Noted.

424
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,040
You have...

425
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,760
So beautiful.

426
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,040
You have the face for plain makeup.

427
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,319
This eyebrow will suit you.

428
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,880
Gorgeous.

429
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,479
- Do I look good?
- Here.

430
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,079
Yes.

431
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:12,800
Have a look.

432
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,599
Wow.

433
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,199
What technique is this, Miss Feng?

434
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:18,000
Caged Smoke Eyebrow.

435
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,479
Can you teach me, Miss Feng?

436
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,280
Several days ago,

437
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,319
Xiangyun learned
the Tear-shaped Contour from you.

438
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:24,680
It was so beautiful.

439
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,760
I asked her to teach me

440
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,319
but she wouldn't.

441
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,400
I learned it from Miss Feng.

442
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,839
Without her permission,

443
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:31,920
I can't teach you.

444
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,280
Tear-shaped Contour

445
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,400
will not look good on you.

446
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:36,479
Caged Smoke Eyebrow is a perfect fit.

447
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,839
If you want to learn it,

448
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,959
I can teach you.

449
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,079
However...

450
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:41,959
I know. I know.

451
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,400
I'll ask the Royal Kitchen

452
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
to give you more veggies tonight.

453
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,839
It's not about the veggies.

454
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,479
I want a fish.

455
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:48,040
Okay?

456
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,119
Noted.

457
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,319
Miss Feng,

458
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,479
I brewed this tea with the morning dews

459
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,319
I collected this morning.

460
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,000
Try it.

461
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:53,839
Thank you.

462
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,479
Thank you.

463
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:55,479
Well...

464
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,719
Can you tell me

465
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,959
how my headdress looks like?

466
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:00,040
I want to learn makeup from you.

467
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,119
Also,

468
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,839
I want to learn something else,
Miss Feng.

469
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,040
Me too.

470
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,959
Patience.

471
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,199
I'll teach all of you.

472
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:06,640
Okay.

473
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,040
However, I have to attend
to something now.

474
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,319
Just wait for me.
I'll teach you once I'm back.

475
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,400
Thanks, Miss Feng.

476
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,439
So pretty.

477
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:14,920
I know, right?

478
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,000
She's been here for a few days

479
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,599
and the entire Luohua Palace

480
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,439
forgot who they are supposed
to be serving.

481
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,160
Princess Hua.

482
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,760
You should move it here.

483
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,479
Then Black Foxy

484
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
will place one here.

485
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,800
If you continue here,

486
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
he'll block your path.

487
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,520
And now, the final piece.

488
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:43,959
Do you know
what this strategy is called?

489
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,959
A Foxy Bait.

490
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,160
I didn't know

491
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,319
you can play chess too, Miss Feng.

492
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,280
I can't play it.

493
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,640
I just know Black Foxy very well.

494
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,160
They say the martial arts world
is full of barbarians

495
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,000
but I beg to differ.

496
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,959
Does everyone in the martial arts world

497
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,560
know poems, Six Arts,

498
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,560
literature, and weaponry

499
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,599
like you two?

500
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,160
In that case, the royal family
does not hold a candle to you.

501
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,280
A question for you then, Princess Hua.

502
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,599
Are all princesses

503
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,800
as bold as you

504
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,520
to accommodate two unknown strangers

505
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,920
from the martial arts world?

506
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,760
I took both of you in
because I'm confident

507
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,920
that I did not misjudge your characters.

508
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,319
Both of you are very unique.

509
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:29,959
As someone who spent her entire life
in the Royal Palace,

510
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,800
this is the most outstanding memory yet.

511
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:32,959
I will

512
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,719
definitely miss it

513
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:37,599
and that's why I will cherish it.

514
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,239
Cherish it

515
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,520
because you can never have it.

516
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,680
Indeed.

517
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,439
Princess Hua.

518
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,479
You're confined to the palace every day.

519
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,319
Don't you want to venture out?

520
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,479
In the outside world,

521
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:55,680
the plants

522
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,920
and the people

523
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,599
are more interesting
than the ones in the palace.

524
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,439
Venture out?

525
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,119
It might feel refreshing at first

526
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,479
but wherever people dwell,

527
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,000
things will always turn out the same.

528
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,000
I can't sew

529
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,400
nor can I cultivate crops,

530
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,920
not to mention leading a plain life.

531
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,400
How can I get accustomed

532
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,359
to a commoner's routine?

533
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,199
I only know

534
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,439
some unimportant matters

535
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,079
and I only learn how to protect myself

536
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:24,239
within the palace.

537
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,160
Marvelous.

538
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:29,239
Well said, Princess Hua.

539
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,520
I thought you would be one of those

540
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,599
noble ladies

541
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,680
who would

542
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,319
discard their wealth

543
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,000
for a life of freedom.

544
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,839
I didn't expect
this perspective from you.

545
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,079
You're wise, Princess Hua.

546
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,160
You know others and yourself.

547
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,640
You want to see the world

548
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,520
but the world is inside you.

549
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,839
Your Highness.

550
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,199
His Lordship summons you.

551
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:57,880
Excuse me.

552
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:07,640
How likely are we

553
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:09,319
to convince her?

554
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,520
I think she puts her guard down
against you.

555
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,359
It's time to tell her.

556
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:14,479
Okay.

557
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,160
I'll hang out with her in a few days.

558
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,640
Why is Father looking for me?

559
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,160
I asked the messenger.

560
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,640
Apparently, it has something to do

561
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,239
with the two guests you took in,
Your Highness.

562
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,880
The fish

563
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,920
is about to take the bait.

564
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,640
Greetings, Father.

565
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,119
May you live for a millennium.

566
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,439
At ease.

567
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,239
Thanks, Father.

568
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,119
I heard...

569
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,719
Father, have you
heard of Hei-Bai Fengxi?

570
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,040
Of course.

571
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,319
They are the two strongest fighters
at the moment.

572
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,800
But Chunran,

573
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,000
why did you mention them?

574
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,800
I just want to tell you

575
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,199
that they are visiting me as guests.

576
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,040
Chun, you're a princess.

577
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:19,800
You shouldn't mingle with the people
from the martial arts world.

578
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,880
Besides, Hei Fengxi is a man.

579
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:24,280
If he stays in your palace

580
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,760
and the world catches wind of it,

581
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,719
your reputation will be ruined.

582
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:28,479
Father,

583
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,479
Hei-Bai Fengxi are a man and a woman.

584
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,000
Both of them are staying together.

585
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,000
Besides, there are hundreds of maids

586
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and servants here.

587
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,560
I have nothing to hide
so I have nothing to be afraid of.

588
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,599
Father, you once told me

589
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,680
that many interesting individuals
dwell in the martial arts world.

590
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,439
After talking to Hei-Bai Fengxi,

591
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,079
I can confirm

592
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,839
that they are rare talents.

593
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,959
If you can get their support,

594
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,280
our nation will prosper.

595
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,160
Youzhou will then no longer be inferior

596
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,640
to Yongzhou and Jizhou.

597
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,599
You want me to hire them?

598
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,959
Yes.

599
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:08,079
They managed to sneak past the guards

600
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,239
into the Royal Palace.

601
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,359
That is already the proof
of their competence.

602
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,479
I took them in and talked to them

603
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,000
because I want to keep them here

604
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,280
so that they can serve you.

605
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,640
Perhaps

606
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:25,000
they can help you conquer the world.

607
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,000
Chun,

608
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,719
you have always been a clever girl.

609
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,760
Only you

610
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,400
can get what I'm thinking.

611
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,319
Come, take a seat.

612
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,319
Have a seat.

613
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,599
Father,

614
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,000
will you meet them?

615
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,319
Not at the moment.

616
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,319
The people in the martial arts world
can be treacherous.

617
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,239
I will wait and see.

618
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,239
They have stayed with you for five days.

619
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,439
You're a princess.

620
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,880
You shouldn't mingle with
uncivilized people like them.

621
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,079
Please ask them
to find accommodation elsewhere.

622
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,400
So you already knew they stayed

623
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,800
with me, Father.

624
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,280
Were you spying on me?

625
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:19,680
You don't trust me?

626
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,000
Not at all, Chun.

627
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,520
I didn't have anyone spy on you.

628
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,199
Your brother was worried about you

629
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:29,920
so he let me know.

630
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,439
Chunyuan?

631
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,959
In that case,

632
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,680
I am terrified.

633
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,959
If Chunyuan knows what happens
in my palace,

634
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,400
then my journey back
from the Imperial City...

635
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,959
Also, the two criminals

636
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,719
who claimed he hired them...

637
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,920
I...

638
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,479
Chun, fret not.

639
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,640
I will get to the bottom of this.

640
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,439
Come.

641
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,479
Sit down.

642
00:25:58,959 --> 00:25:59,599
Chun,

643
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,760
when I tell the world
you are looking for a suitor,

644
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:07,560
your admirers all come here.

645
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,439
Royal descendants and brave heroes
walk among them.

646
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,880
Chun,

647
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,280
what kind of husband do you want?

648
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,640
What kind of son-in-law
do you want, Father?

649
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:23,000
Not many merit

650
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,439
your status, Chun.

651
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,479
Considering their statuses,
talents, and appearance,

652
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,959
only two

653
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,640
are worthy of you.

654
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,040
One is Prince Lanxi of Yongzhou.

655
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,599
The other is the heir
of Lord of Jizhou, Huang Chao.

656
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:43,479
What do you think, Father?

657
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,000
Prince Huang Chao has arrived here.

658
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,119
I met him this morning.

659
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,119
Indeed, he is both handsome and capable.

660
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,079
As for Prince Lanxi,

661
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,640
he did write to me,

662
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,560
citing his volition to marry you.

663
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,640
What do you think, Chun?

664
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,400
If

665
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:13,520
my husband isn't someone
from a royal bloodline

666
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,839
like Prince Lanxi

667
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,280
or Prince Huang Chao,

668
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,119
but a very talented commoner,

669
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,160
not only can he help you, Father,

670
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,640
but he also wouldn't have
the mind to usurp Youzhou.

671
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,160
Chun,

672
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,560
have you taken a liking

673
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,760
to Hei Fengxi?

674
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,400
What do you think, Father?

675
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,400
Chun!

676
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,479
Hei Fengxi is a lowly fighter
from the martial arts world.

677
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,680
He doesn't deserve my daughter.

678
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,119
But in your announcement,

679
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,479
you said that I get to select

680
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:47,079
my husband,
regardless of his social class.

681
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,239
That was just for show.

682
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,599
Why would a princess

683
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,239
marry a commoner?

684
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,520
When I said
the social class didn't matter,

685
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,400
it was to appease the public.

686
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,079
Knowing your talent and your beauty,

687
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,280
you should be the emperor's consort.

688
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,319
Nice drawing, Princess Hua.

689
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,680
Miss Feng.

690
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,640
You flatter him in your drawing.

691
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,319
What you have here is a head-turner.

692
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,479
Does it not look like him?

693
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,839
Not at all.

694
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,239
Let me show you.

695
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,760
Watch me, Princess Hua.

696
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:58,640
Black Foxy

697
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,359
has a long face,

698
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,000
like a goose egg.

699
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,680
His eyebrows

700
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,359
stretch out like this.

701
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,680
It points upward here.

702
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,439
He

703
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
also has

704
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,160
a seductive pair of eyes.

705
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,040
When he glances at you,

706
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,599
it almost feels coquettish.

707
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,839
His best feature

708
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,160
is his nose.

709
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,920
It leads you to think
that he's a virtuous man

710
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,239
yet he's anything but that.

711
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,160
Princess Hua,
have you heard of this saying?

712
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,079
Thin lips, cold heart.

713
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,839
He has thin lips.

714
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,400
He looks like a trustworthy person

715
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,959
but in fact, he is the opposite.

716
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,640
You have to be careful.

717
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:02,640
What do you think?

718
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:07,239
I can truly see him
in your drawing, Miss Feng.

719
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,479
You must have known him very well

720
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,640
to capture all the details like these.

721
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,400
I have known him for many years.

722
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,079
Can you help me then,

723
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,920
Miss Feng?

724
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,839
How can I help?

725
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,959
I quite fancy Mr. Feng

726
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,400
and I would like
to have him as my husband.

727
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,280
Will you help me, Miss Feng?

728
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,400
Almost all handsome men

729
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,640
of Dadong

730
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,280
came here to ask for your hands,

731
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,880
including the heir of Lord of Jizhou

732
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,239
and the Prince of Yongzhou.

733
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:44,640
Among those obvious choices,

734
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,920
you pick

735
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,839
someone lowly
from the martial arts world.

736
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:49,479
Because among them,

737
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,119
my father only likes Huang Chao
and Feng Lanxi.

738
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,640
Both of them

739
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,599
are important to their own states.

740
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,640
They will prioritize
their own interest first.

741
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,560
If I marry them,

742
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,439
I...

743
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,880
I just want to be happy
and to be truthful to myself

744
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,640
for the rest of my life.

745
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,040
I have already possessed

746
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,040
what a woman can ever ask for,

747
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,239
power and fame.

748
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,640
Whoever I marry and wherever I go,

749
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,400
I will remain affluent.

750
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,800
Do you believe me, Miss Feng?

751
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,479
I do.

752
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,245
(Majestic Moon)

753
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,880
I also know

754
00:31:32,439 --> 00:31:34,599
I can never find
someone like him anymore

755
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,079
so I want to convince Mr. Feng

756
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,359
to stay here for me.

757
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,079
Beautiful,

758
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,680
smart,

759
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,839
and conniving.

760
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,920
You two

761
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,319
are quite alike in certain areas.

762
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,640
Shrewd and calculative.

763
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,400
Comprehend the meaning of life

764
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,160
yet obsessed with riches.

765
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:56,880
So many facets.

766
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,040
You're the first one who tells me that

767
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,959
without holding anything back.

768
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:04,719
You're right.

769
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,880
I am such a woman.

770
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,000
You can find any excuses for yourself.

771
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,959
Why did you tell me the truth?

772
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,000
Because I

773
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,760
have never had a true friend,

774
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,359
except you,

775
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:19,719
Bai Fengxi.

776
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,680
I hope you're my real friend.

777
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,959
We will treat each other with sincerity,

778
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:26,880
without any ulterior motive.

779
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,280
That's because
I'm from the martial arts world.

780
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,199
I do not pose a threat to you.

781
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:33,439
Yes.

782
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:36,839
Miss Feng.

783
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,560
Is that a yes?

784
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:37,760
Is that a yes?

785
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,800
You truly believe

786
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
she's in love with me?

787
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,560
Compared with love,

788
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,719
she's more concerned

789
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,880
about the future of Youzhou

790
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,560
and her power.

791
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,119
She picks me

792
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:53,920
because I'm Hei Fengxi.

793
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,719
I'm powerful in the martial arts world

794
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,400
but all isolated

795
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,319
within the politics.

796
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,359
And that's the problem.

797
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,239
I'm also Feng Lanxi.

798
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,079
Your Highness,

799
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,800
do you think Miss Feng will help you?

800
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:12,040
She will.

801
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,040
Why are you so sure?

802
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,066
(Notes of Tan, First Tome)
Hasn't she

803
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,439
(Notes of Tan, First Tome)
been trying to fish out info

804
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,119
about me from you?

805
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:21,160
There's only one explanation.

806
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,119
She's helping Hei Fengxi.

807
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,400
I'm

808
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,520
just playing along.

809
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,000
So both of them came here

810
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,920
for that?

811
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,280
So Mr. Feng is just
as cunning as Miss Feng

812
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:33,319
claimed to be.

813
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,959
No, he's smart.

814
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,719
He knows to keep his friends close
and his enemies closer.

815
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:41,199
You think highly of him, Your Highness.

816
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,359
Mr. Feng

817
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,800
is just perfect in your eyes.

818
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Do you think

819
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,555
I'll be fettered

820
00:33:48,564 --> 00:33:50,800
(Notes of Tan, First Tome)
by love?

821
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,199
Of course, not.

822
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:54,520
You most definitely are not.

823
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,520
(I gave up
Feng Lanxi of Yongzhou for him.)

824
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,920
On the day of the marriage proposal,

825
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,479
you will appear
as Feng Lanxi of Yongzhou.

826
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,239
For others,

827
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,119
Feng Lanxi is Hei Fengxi.

828
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,479
There's nothing wrong with that.

829
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,639
For Hua Chunran,

830
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,439
this will be a surprise.

831
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:12,919
And then,

832
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,159
she won't marry you.

833
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,080
Exactly.

834
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,760
She came to me for help

835
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,320
because one,
I'm from the martial arts world.

836
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,760
I do not pose a threat to her.

837
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:22,840
Two,

838
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:25,360
she wants to test our relationship.

839
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,199
She wants me to influence your decision

840
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,320
to her own end.

841
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:29,639
Yes.

842
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,840
Is there no sincerity left

843
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:36,600
in this world?

844
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,959
I told my father to choose him

845
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,840
because he has no background

846
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,199
but is very powerful.

847
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,879
With him, Youzhou can stand a chance
to unite the Six States.

848
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,280
I told Miss Feng that I'd choose him

849
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:58,800
because he would make me happy.

850
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,959
That was and wasn't

851
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,679
a lie.

852
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,199
Why

853
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,239
Mr. Feng then?

854
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,159
Because he has desires

855
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,600
and he's the easiest to be manipulated.

856
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:15,199
While he denies it,

857
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:17,479
I can tell he likes Miss Feng.

858
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,439
Yet, he came,

859
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:22,959
which means he also has ambition.

860
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,479
People like that

861
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,600
are the easiest to control.

862
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,679
What a foresight, Your Highness.

863
00:35:35,482 --> 00:35:38,560
(Yongzhou Royal Palace)

864
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:41,959
Your Lordship,

865
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,879
letters from Youzhou.

866
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:46,679
Two letters.

867
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,199
One from the House of Jade in Youzhou.

868
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:49,879
Another is from

869
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:51,919
the people who follow

870
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:52,840
Marquis Yongping.

871
00:35:58,479 --> 00:35:59,479
Both letters

872
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,239
bear the same content,

873
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,919
but the one from House of Jade

874
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,760
has more details.

875
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:07,199
It even

876
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:10,840
has the info of all other suitors

877
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:13,320
who went to Youzhou.

878
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,360
I have been organizing

879
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,479
the intel Fountain Abode handed over.

880
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,800
Just the organization alone

881
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,879
took two weeks.

882
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:22,919
The intel

883
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,840
sheds light on the martial arts world,

884
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,439
the royal family of every state,

885
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:28,919
and even some confidential affairs.

886
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,120
Each intel comes with

887
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,040
its respective postscript.

888
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:33,040
Truth be told,

889
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:34,399
I am

890
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,159
impressed by Marquis Yongping's ability

891
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:38,360
to manage

892
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:40,479
such a vast intel network.

893
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,959
And if I let you manage Fountain Abode?

894
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,159
You flatter me, Your Lordship.

895
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,439
I'm afraid only Marquis Yongping

896
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:53,800
can manage

897
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:54,959
such a huge intel network.

898
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,040
Marquis Yongping has relinquished
all his martial techniques.

899
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,239
He has displayed his loyalty.

900
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,679
I think...

901
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:04,239
You think Lanxi

902
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,479
will be content

903
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:07,679
working backstage forever?

904
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,120
I believe

905
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,800
he went to Youzhou

906
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,560
with a backup plan.

907
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,239
Your Lordship.

908
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:17,120
Why do you distrust Marquis Yongping so?

909
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,320
Father knows best.

910
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,080
If he hides for another decade,

911
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,199
then I'll have no choice.

912
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,399
Your Lordship.

913
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,800
If the princess agrees to
Prince Lanxi's proposal,

914
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:33,360
will he ally with Youzhou

915
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,560
to overthrow Yongzhou?

916
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:41,600
He is a smart man.

917
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:42,560
He knows

918
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,840
if I allow him to go to Youzhou,

919
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,439
I must have a contingency plan.

920
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,120
Now, he has to choose wisely.
