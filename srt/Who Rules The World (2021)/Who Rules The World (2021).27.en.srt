=Episode 27=

20
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:43,352
I came to Liangcheng

21
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:44,551
with some medicine too.

22
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:46,231
If you need medicine,

23
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:48,352
bring your prescription
to the Protectorate.

24
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:49,752
Everything has been arranged.

25
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:50,472
Wonderful.

26
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:53,592
Thank you, Your Highness.

27
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:54,511
Go get your medicine.

28
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,352
Okay. Thank you so much.

29
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:57,352
Thanks, Your Highness.

30
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,152
The rest of you

31
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:00,912
can consult me too.

32
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:04,271
What?

33
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:05,831
You can heal too, Your Highness?

34
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:06,551
I...

35
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:07,472
You don't trust me?

36
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:08,872
My medical knowledge

37
00:02:09,632 --> 00:02:11,472
might be superior to hers.

38
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:14,271
Excuse me?

39
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:14,991
Don't make a bold claim.

40
00:02:15,072 --> 00:02:15,711
Fancy a competition

41
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:17,231
to see who can save more lives?

42
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:18,632
Bring it on.

43
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:20,352
Okay.

44
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:22,792
Whoever comes to me for the consultation

45
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:23,872
will receive an extra dou of rice.

46
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:27,752
Careful.

47
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:28,632
Line up, please.

48
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:29,271
Hold on.

49
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:30,231
Get in line!

50
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,671
No need to rush.

51
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:33,472
No need to rush.

52
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:35,951
Madam, let me check on you.

53
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:44,951
They are as competitive

54
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:46,231
as usual.

55
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:49,431
Thanks, Your Highness.

56
00:03:01,592 --> 00:03:02,511
It's finally over.

57
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,391
Thank you for your help today.

58
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,391
I appreciate it.

59
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:13,312
No need.

60
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:14,872
We work for the people.

61
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,032
That day on the dam,

62
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,632
I noticed they all
have some sort of sickness.

63
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,592
So I used my mediocre medical knowledge

64
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:22,472
to treat them.

65
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,511
I thank you on behalf
of the people in Liangcheng.

66
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:28,192
However, you have proven today

67
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,711
that your medical knowledge
is not mediocre at all.

68
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:32,352
It's quite good.

69
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:34,671
Stop putting me on a pedestal already.

70
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:35,752
Tell me then.

71
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,231
Who won today?

72
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,072
Well.

73
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:42,312
Let's pretend

74
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:44,472
you won today.

75
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:45,752
Just pretend?

76
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:50,831
In our match today,

77
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:52,831
I lost to you fair and square.

78
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:56,472
Heroine Feng, your medical knowledge
commands respect.

79
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:59,152
Some might even say you're the Hua Tuo,

80
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:01,632
that your feat
will be recorded in history.

81
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:03,472
All right.

82
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:04,752
Since you lost,

83
00:04:04,872 --> 00:04:06,711
you should be punished.

84
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:11,271
What do you want now?

85
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:14,831
I think I sat far too long today

86
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:16,912
so I'm having back pain.

87
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,352
I feel sore.

88
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,312
I wonder

89
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:21,752
how good of a masseur you are,
Mr. Lanxi?

90
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:22,511
I'm just curious.

91
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:23,632
That's all.

92
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:28,872
Count yourself lucky today.

93
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:39,152
Relax.

94
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:41,472
Why are you so tensed?

95
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:42,912
No, I'm not.

96
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:44,312
But what if this is an act of vengeance?

97
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:45,872
I'm not a sore loser.

98
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:47,152
Don't worry.

99
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:25,152
Your Highness.

100
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:26,592
News from the capital of Yongzhou.
Something happened.

101
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:28,551
What happened?

102
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:30,671
People in House of Jade
have been arrested.

103
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:35,072
Inform Chuanyun and Chuanyu

104
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:37,032
and let them defend Liangcheng.

105
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:38,312
They will supervise the dam construction

106
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:40,152
and will also train the Moyu Cavalry.

107
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:41,271
Tomorrow morning,

108
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:43,271
you and I will return to the capital.

109
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:44,511
Yes, Your Highness.

110
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,840
(Unwavering Loyalty)

111
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,391
You're awake?

112
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:08,152
I'll head back with you tomorrow.

113
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:16,871
You heard everything?

114
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:18,432
Let's head back together.

115
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:19,951
I want to be by your side.

116
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:21,792
I won't take a no.

117
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:24,472
So you were awake all this time.

118
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:27,631
Did you feign asleep just now

119
00:06:28,432 --> 00:06:29,472
so that I would carry you in my arms?

120
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:32,672
Yes.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,960
(Unwavering Loyalty)

122
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:44,871
All right.

123
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,112
Let's head back together.

124
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,166
(Unwavering Loyalty)

125
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:21,711
Who are you?

126
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:23,711
How dare you intercept the carriage
that holds the Divine Fairy of Dadong?

127
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:44,552
Continue searching!

128
00:07:44,552 --> 00:07:45,191
Yes, sir.

129
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,191
As you predicted, Your Highness.

130
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:50,871
Let's go.

131
00:07:57,912 --> 00:07:58,552
Did you hear?

132
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:00,951
Dadong has a Divine Fairy!

133
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:01,472
I did.

134
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:02,352
My cousin just returned

135
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:03,232
from the Imperial City.

136
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:05,112
He said the Divine Fairy
was a fine beauty.

137
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:05,951
Just fine?

138
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:07,472
That is inaccurate.

139
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:07,992
I heard

140
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:09,311
she's as beautiful as a goddess.

141
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:10,472
I also heard

142
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:11,751
that when she was praying inside
the Imperial Palace,

143
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:13,271
flowers bloomed.

144
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:14,112
Yes.

145
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:15,352
She was meant

146
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:16,831
to receive the sarira.

147
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:19,552
She was praying to Buddha for Dadong.

148
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:20,912
Touched by her devotion,

149
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,191
Buddha bestowed upon her the sarira.

150
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:24,831
And then, she brought it
to the Imperial City.

151
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:25,631
Do you know

152
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,352
that night,

153
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:27,951
the Imperial City basked
under the holy light?

154
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:31,032
The people are more reassured
now that we got the sarira.

155
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:33,391
No wonder the Six States are calmer now.

156
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,311
But on her way back,

157
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,311
she ran into thugs and went missing.

158
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:39,751
However, Youzhou has sent
its people looking for her.

159
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:41,672
Divine Fairy has earned God's favor.

160
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,032
I'm sure she will be safe.

161
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:44,472
Come, have some.

162
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:45,391
(Tea)
Okay.

163
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:45,831
(Tea)
Sir,

164
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:46,792
(Tea)
refill, please.

165
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:47,552
Coming!

166
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:48,592
Your Highness.

167
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:50,432
How is Youzhou?

168
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,751
His Lordship is searching for you.

169
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:54,032
Our people spied in secret

170
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:55,032
and found out

171
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,912
that the Heir of Lord attacked you.

172
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:00,511
My brother sure is afraid that I,
the Divine Fairy,

173
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:02,552
will usurp his position.

174
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:04,631
What about the marriage proposal?

175
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:06,432
Apart from Yongzhou,

176
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:08,032
the Heirs from other States are coming.

177
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:10,232
I heard Yongzhou still hasn't decided
on its candidate.

178
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:11,831
Yongzhou.

179
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:14,672
We'll stay in Decheng today

180
00:09:14,831 --> 00:09:15,792
and return to Youzhou tomorrow.

181
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:16,871
Noted.

182
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:21,592
Stop there.

183
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,831
Miss, spare a few coins, please.

184
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:25,352
Let them in.

185
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:28,352
What got into you, madam?

186
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:31,032
My mother caught a cold a few days ago.

187
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,992
I think it went into her lungs

188
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:35,271
and our village physicians
couldn't heal her.

189
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:37,432
I plan to try my luck in the city.

190
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:38,912
Mother, you can't sit here.

191
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,592
It's okay. Let her be.

192
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:42,631
Thanks, Miss.

193
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:43,631
Hong.

194
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:45,792
Get some bread from the restaurant.

195
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:02,672
Thanks, Miss.

196
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:07,472
Thank you so much.

197
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:09,112
You're too kind.

198
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:10,352
I will not forget

199
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:11,831
the kindness you show today.

200
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:12,751
Don't sweat about it.

201
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:14,311
We all have ups and downs.

202
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:15,951
Enjoy.

203
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:23,432
Wait, Miss.

204
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:25,992
Can you do us another favor

205
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:28,391
and let us tag along?

206
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:30,071
Let them come with us.

207
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:33,071
Miss...

208
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:35,552
We can use them as our disguise.

209
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:36,631
Noted.

210
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,191
My gracious Young Lady

211
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,271
allows you to join us.

212
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:41,152
Come.

213
00:10:41,152 --> 00:10:41,912
Thanks, Miss.

214
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:42,511
Thank you.

215
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,871
Thanks, Miss.

216
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:48,511
After we traverse Zhuoshui,

217
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:49,631
we'll arrive in Youzhou.

218
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,792
What do you think
of the Princess of Youzhou?

219
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,992
She took the initiative to deliver
the sarira to the Imperial City

220
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:57,711
and set herself up for much success.

221
00:10:58,511 --> 00:10:59,751
She's not an ordinary woman.

222
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:01,592
What about the rumor
that she was assaulted?

223
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:03,951
There was no one on the carriage.

224
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:07,311
If I have a woman

225
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:08,711
like that,

226
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:10,951
my life will be interesting.

227
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,152
Feng Lanxi went to Liangcheng
to meet with Prince Xieyue

228
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:15,552
and then, Qingzhou withdrew its army.

229
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,472
Qingzhou and Yongzhou are two
neighboring states.

230
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:19,871
If they join forces,

231
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,152
their power will grow stronger.

232
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:24,751
That's why I'm heading to Youzhou.

233
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,831
Youzhou and Qingzhou
have been fighting for generations.

234
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:29,792
Joining hands with Youzhou
against Qingzhou

235
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:31,552
is our best option.

236
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:32,711
This time,

237
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:33,511
Wuyuan,

238
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:36,191
you have to help me.

239
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:39,152
Princess Chunran has to be mine.

240
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,912
However, the assault on the princess

241
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:44,112
might be the doing
of Lord of Youzhou's Heir.

242
00:11:44,432 --> 00:11:46,472
Since the heir of Lord of Youzhou
already treats her like an enemy,

243
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,432
getting control over Youzhou
must be a hard row to hoe for her.

244
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:52,112
She survived the assault.

245
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:53,672
That means not all hopes are lost

246
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:55,552
on Youzhou.

247
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:56,511
Besides,

248
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:58,112
if she wants Youzhou to herself,

249
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:00,271
she needs all the help she can get.

250
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:02,032
That

251
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,672
only polishes my value.

252
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:06,751
I have a question.

253
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:08,751
Ask away.

254
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:10,751
If Princess Chunran of Youzhou

255
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,032
and Princess Xiyun of Qingzhou

256
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:14,871
confront you

257
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:16,472
and say they will only marry you,

258
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:17,711
who will you pick?

259
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:21,352
Wuyuan,

260
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:23,352
if you were me,

261
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:24,992
who would you pick?

262
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:29,271
I'm sure you already have an answer.

263
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,751
Princess Xiyun is known worldwide.

264
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:35,112
While she looks like
a better candidate than Chunran,

265
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:37,552
Qingzhou and Jizhou are too far away.

266
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:39,311
If a war breaks out,

267
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:41,232
it'll be hard for the help to arrive.

268
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:43,271
At the moment, my pick will be Chunran.

269
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:46,751
When I ascend
to the throne in the future,

270
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:49,432
getting Xiyun will be easy.

271
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:56,071
What now?

272
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:58,871
You're worried about the people again?

273
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:00,672
After this,

274
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,032
a war will break out.

275
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:04,672
To unite all States,

276
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:06,912
war is inevitable.

277
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:09,871
But with us containing the conflict,

278
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:11,112
many

279
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:13,871
innocents will be spared.

280
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:16,112
I sure hope so.

281
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:17,912
May we keep the sacrifices
to the minimum.

282
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:18,912
I understand.

283
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:20,992
As a ruler,

284
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:23,311
my duty is to protect my subjects

285
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:26,992
and to allow them
to lead a fulfilling life.

286
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,311
Can I hold you against your words?

287
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:30,711
Definitely.

288
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,552
Your Highness,
they have been dealt with.

289
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:45,352
You can rest here.

290
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:46,711
We will stand guard by the door.

291
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:49,352
Noted.

292
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:16,432
Mother.

293
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:18,871
Your drug is potent.

294
00:14:19,312 --> 00:14:21,152
They are some good quality drugs

295
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,312
given by the Heir of Lord

296
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:23,591
before we left.

297
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:25,832
All this just to

298
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,952
get rid of the Divine Fairy of Dadong.

299
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:28,792
Mother,

300
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:30,152
this strategy of yours is brilliant.

301
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,032
We pretended to be homeless

302
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,471
to follow the princess.

303
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,712
All right. Do not dally.

304
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:35,912
Kill her

305
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:37,631
so that we can return to His Highness.

306
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:39,391
All right.

307
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:50,792
Help!

308
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:54,672
Help!

309
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:55,631
Help!

310
00:14:58,511 --> 00:14:59,432
Help!

311
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:06,912
Help!

312
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:10,231
Help!

313
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:16,751
They killed my servants.
Now, they are after me!

314
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:17,591
Help!

315
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:19,952
Mister,

316
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:21,912
my daughter here is spouting nonsense.

317
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:23,672
She's crazy, you see.

318
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,912
She even hit her brother just now.

319
00:15:25,912 --> 00:15:26,552
Look.

320
00:15:27,032 --> 00:15:27,432
Exactly.

321
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:28,912
Oh, my dear. Come with me.

322
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:29,591
- Stop bothering others.
- Wait.

323
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:31,991
If she's your daughter,

324
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:33,712
what's her name then?

325
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:34,912
I'll count to three.

326
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:36,432
Both of you answer at the same time.

327
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,231
One.

328
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:41,072
Two.

329
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:49,111
Sir.

330
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:50,912
Check if someone died in the inn.

331
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:51,792
Yes, Sir.

332
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,111
She's fine. She's just drugged.

333
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:04,312
She should be awake soon.

334
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:06,672
Both perpetrators have been sent
to the local council.

335
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:08,192
They said

336
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:09,832
that this woman here had been
donating money.

337
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:11,111
They wanted her money

338
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,072
so they killed her guards
and her servants.

339
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:14,832
Both of them are waiting
for their death sentence.

340
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:17,072
The world is chaotic.

341
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:18,471
There is much unrest

342
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:20,312
and everyone is struggling to live.

343
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:23,672
Those who are at their wit's end
might resort to crimes.

344
00:16:24,712 --> 00:16:26,712
If everyone can adhere
to strict discipline,

345
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:28,672
it will be a prosperous world indeed.

346
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:30,832
I will definitely help you

347
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:32,471
to achieve your ambition.

348
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:37,712
Fret not, Miss.

349
00:16:38,152 --> 00:16:39,231
You are fine.

350
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:40,871
You were just drugged.

351
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:42,871
Also, both assailants

352
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:44,591
have been captured

353
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:45,712
and are waiting
for their death sentence.

354
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,192
Thank you for saving my life, Mister.

355
00:16:57,832 --> 00:16:58,712
I will never

356
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,032
forget this favor from you.

357
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:02,832
You're welcome, Miss.

358
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:09,391
Can I borrow a bowl of water?

359
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:27,432
Thanks, Mister.

360
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:29,072
You have the soundness of mind

361
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:30,952
to take care of your appearance
after a crisis.

362
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:32,391
Very admirable.

363
00:17:32,712 --> 00:17:33,591
Thank you, Mister.

364
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,312
My appearance reflects my demeanor.

365
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:37,792
I have to remind myself

366
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:40,152
to stay strong,

367
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:42,152
even if I hit rock bottom.

368
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,432
Those two were after your money.

369
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:47,631
In your future voyage,

370
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:48,471
remember

371
00:17:48,712 --> 00:17:49,912
to be discreet
with how you spend your money.

372
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:52,192
Thank you for the advice, Mister.

373
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:54,952
Can you do me another favor

374
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:57,832
and escort me to Youzhou?

375
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,712
How do you know I'm heading to Youzhou?

376
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,432
Princess of Youzhou
is looking for a suitor.

377
00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:05,712
Judging from your manner of speech

378
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:08,152
and your foreign accent,

379
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:11,072
you must be heading there
to ask for her hands.

380
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:12,952
Keen observation, Miss.

381
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:15,471
I will help you then.

382
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,961
(Qingzhou)

383
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:27,312
The issue in Liangcheng
has been settled?

384
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:28,032
Yes.

385
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,952
Prince Yongping of Yongzhou,
Feng Lanxi, was there

386
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:33,231
and he killed Yu Ming.

387
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,152
He has reclaimed
the ownership of Liangcheng.

388
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:37,312
And then,

389
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:39,111
I met with him.

390
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,832
He proposed a canal management project.

391
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:44,631
Once the canals are built,
the flood will disappear.

392
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:47,312
Mr. Lanxi.

393
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:52,712
His reputation precedes him.

394
00:18:57,391 --> 00:18:57,952
Father,

395
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,072
your health...

396
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,312
Do not worry.

397
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:03,391
I know

398
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:05,672
my body very well.

399
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,832
I have also consulted the physician.

400
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:15,792
Feng Lanxi has a great reputation

401
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:19,792
but he's still someone from Yongzhou.

402
00:19:20,912 --> 00:19:23,072
You have to stay alert.

403
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:27,152
The world now

404
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:28,471
is not what it used to be.

405
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:30,072
A warring Six States

406
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:31,952
will appear soon.

407
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,952
While Qingzhou
does not wish for dominion,

408
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:37,552
we can't

409
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:41,552
give up our defense either.

410
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:42,792
Father.

411
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:45,192
Feng Lanxi is trustworthy.

412
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:46,312
Also,

413
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:48,391
someone can vouch for his character.

414
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:49,631
I know. It's Xiyun.

415
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:52,072
How do you know, Father?

416
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:53,391
Other than her,

417
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:56,591
who else can give you this confidence?

418
00:19:58,832 --> 00:19:59,672
However,

419
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:04,072
why is she involved with Feng Lanxi?

420
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:06,792
Not just involved, I'm afraid.

421
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:10,871
Pray tell.

422
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:16,072
You're the best, Qiwu.

423
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:18,712
You made this yourself, didn't you?

424
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:21,751
In this world, only you
know me this well, Qiwu.

425
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,192
You

426
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:25,871
and your sweet talk.

427
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:27,271
I'm not lying.

428
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:29,072
I'm being sincere.

429
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:30,792
Your stay in Liangcheng

430
00:20:30,952 --> 00:20:31,912
must be a tough one.

431
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:33,471
Not really.

432
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:35,792
While my sojourn there wasn't relaxing,

433
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:36,832
it was fulfilling nevertheless.

434
00:20:38,712 --> 00:20:39,712
Once the dust has settled,

435
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:41,072
tell me more about

436
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:43,591
what you and His Highness went through
in Liangcheng.

437
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:44,351
What do you think?

438
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:46,111
The last two months

439
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:47,712
are very eventful.

440
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:49,751
I'll tell you everything
when I have the time.

441
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:53,591
So

442
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:56,231
did something else happen?

443
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:57,471
Something else?

444
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:02,271
Like

445
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:03,912
did His Highness

446
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:06,072
confess again?

447
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,672
So many things were happening.

448
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:11,351
We didn't have the time for this.

449
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:13,552
If it happens, it happens.

450
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:20,511
Delicious.

451
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:25,072
Never have I thought that such a story

452
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:27,351
took place between them.

453
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:29,192
All right.

454
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:30,912
It's not bad.

455
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:35,072
You have indulged Xiyun a lot.

456
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:37,751
It's good that someone
is taking care of her.

457
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:42,471
Also, this Feng Lanxi
has spectacular talents

458
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:45,152
and is a cautious person.

459
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:47,271
With him by her side,

460
00:21:47,552 --> 00:21:49,432
Xiyun should be getting by just fine.

461
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:52,432
You are the one
who indulges her the most, Father.

462
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,792
You won't even let me
tell her that you're sick.

463
00:21:55,152 --> 00:21:57,192
It's just a temporary setback.

464
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:58,591
It's not serious at all.

465
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:01,111
She's traveling alone.

466
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:03,952
Do not burden her
with unnecessary worries.

467
00:22:05,552 --> 00:22:08,312
However, I know
the Lord of Yongzhou's temper

468
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:10,351
very well.

469
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:14,152
If he knows Feng Lanxi is Hei Fengxi,

470
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:18,152
he will never let it slide.

471
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:21,591
About Feng Lanxi's proposal...

472
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:26,312
If he treats Xiyun well,

473
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:28,552
Qingzhou

474
00:22:29,072 --> 00:22:30,952
will be his best ally.

475
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:33,591
As a matter of fact,

476
00:22:33,871 --> 00:22:35,591
old people like us

477
00:22:35,991 --> 00:22:38,832
can never stay in this position forever.

478
00:22:39,511 --> 00:22:40,871
The world

479
00:22:41,511 --> 00:22:42,271
will ultimately

480
00:22:42,912 --> 00:22:45,471
fall onto young people like you.

481
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:49,432
Yongzhou will see
a change of leadership.

482
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,152
It's up to Feng Lanxi to seize it.

483
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:02,072
(Governmental Policies)
These are the governmental policies

484
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:05,231
that I penned after you left Qingzhou.

485
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:08,672
Do read it.

486
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:15,552
Father, you're...

487
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:23,032
My child.

488
00:23:23,991 --> 00:23:25,231
One day,

489
00:23:25,912 --> 00:23:27,471
I'll have to leave this world.

490
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:30,511
And someone

491
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,072
has to protect Qingzhou.

492
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:36,991
Noted, Father.

493
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:42,952
Mentor, I returned
to the capital in secret

494
00:23:43,912 --> 00:23:45,032
and I do not have the liberty
to show my face.

495
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:46,351
That's why I stay in another residence.

496
00:23:46,631 --> 00:23:47,672
Please tell me

497
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:48,792
what happened to House of Jade.

498
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:51,432
Minister Feng investigated
the Ministry of Justice in secret.

499
00:23:51,511 --> 00:23:53,032
She did not find
any missing person reports

500
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:53,991
or any relevant records.

501
00:23:54,712 --> 00:23:56,072
I checked on the martial arts world

502
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:58,152
and no one has seen them.

503
00:23:58,672 --> 00:24:00,192
From the moment we are privy
of the disappearance until now,

504
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:02,072
we have been looking everywhere

505
00:24:02,312 --> 00:24:03,312
to no avail.

506
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:05,231
It's been two weeks already.

507
00:24:06,552 --> 00:24:08,391
What about the branches
of House of Jade in other cities?

508
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:09,871
How are they doing?

509
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:12,631
Those outside of the capital
are safe for the moment.

510
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:16,391
House of Jade is but a small business.

511
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:18,432
Yet, they went through all the hassle.

512
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:21,912
They must be after Fountain Abode.

513
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,552
I believe they are fully prepared

514
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,912
and are waiting for us to move.

515
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:29,471
However, we don't know
who our enemies are

516
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:31,391
and what they wish to achieve.

517
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:34,672
According to the spy we planted

518
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,072
in Prince Ju's residence,

519
00:24:36,712 --> 00:24:38,152
he is already aware

520
00:24:38,152 --> 00:24:39,631
of your true identity.

521
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:41,712
Is it his doing?

522
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:46,072
He lacks the competence
to eliminate Fountain Abode.

523
00:24:46,672 --> 00:24:47,511
He won't go as far

524
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:49,912
as to arrest someone

525
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:51,751
under my father's nose either.

526
00:24:52,312 --> 00:24:53,672
All he can do is be a hindrance.

527
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:55,072
This doesn't sound like him at all.

528
00:24:55,072 --> 00:24:57,231
But why House of Jade?

529
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:58,952
What do they want?

530
00:25:02,072 --> 00:25:02,792
Perhaps

531
00:25:03,552 --> 00:25:04,952
they want a deal.

532
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:06,672
The captured people are their leverage.

533
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,591
And so,

534
00:25:09,312 --> 00:25:10,952
they would keep them alive.

535
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,912
This is already the best-case scenario.

536
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:28,564
You know who the enemy is, don't you?

537
00:25:28,564 --> 00:25:29,324
We have

538
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:31,243
the same person in mind.

539
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:32,724
In Yongzhou,

540
00:25:33,123 --> 00:25:34,403
only someone with immense power

541
00:25:34,763 --> 00:25:36,804
can pull such a bold move.

542
00:25:37,044 --> 00:25:37,964
It must be from the royal family.

543
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:39,883
The extended family

544
00:25:40,403 --> 00:25:41,403
of Yongzhou's royal family

545
00:25:41,403 --> 00:25:42,804
has always been dominated by
the Lord of Yongzhou.

546
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:44,123
They can't possibly pull this off.

547
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:46,763
The mastermind must be your father,

548
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:48,084
the Lord of Yongzhou.

549
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:52,964
What do you plan to do now?

550
00:25:53,523 --> 00:25:55,123
(Father wants me to hand over)

551
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:56,564
(Fountain Abode to him.)

552
00:26:00,003 --> 00:26:01,123
(He doesn't know who I am yet.)

553
00:26:01,564 --> 00:26:02,883
(That is my opening.)

554
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:12,243
Your Lordship,

555
00:26:12,643 --> 00:26:14,603
this is what I have found out lately

556
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:16,844
about Fountain Abode,

557
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:18,964
including their staff and

558
00:26:19,123 --> 00:26:20,643
their trading history.

559
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:22,204
At the moment, I can only find out

560
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:24,643
ordinary trades.

561
00:26:25,044 --> 00:26:26,003
As for their

562
00:26:26,204 --> 00:26:29,204
intel network that has access to all
parties in the martial arts world,

563
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:29,854
since different individuals

564
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,324
(Owner of Fountain Abode, Hei Fengxi)
were dispatched

565
00:26:31,483 --> 00:26:33,324
separately,

566
00:26:34,044 --> 00:26:35,164
I cannot trace it back

567
00:26:35,403 --> 00:26:37,164
to the origin.

568
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:40,044
A huge net

569
00:26:40,444 --> 00:26:42,763
with airtight management.

570
00:26:44,363 --> 00:26:45,804
Impressive.

571
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:49,044
If we can make him work for us,

572
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:51,044
our nation will grow stronger.

573
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:52,924
Any other news?

574
00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:54,483
Not at the moment.

575
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:55,763
However,

576
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:57,643
per your request,

577
00:26:57,844 --> 00:27:00,964
I investigated the entire royal family

578
00:27:01,564 --> 00:27:03,883
and have not found anyone that matches

579
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,444
with Hei Fengxi.

580
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,483
If he's not from the royal family,

581
00:27:08,363 --> 00:27:10,363
we can give him an official title

582
00:27:10,844 --> 00:27:12,724
and incorporate Fountain Abode

583
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,084
into our resources.

584
00:27:14,724 --> 00:27:16,084
They will then work for Yongzhou.

585
00:27:17,123 --> 00:27:18,564
If he refuses to comply,

586
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:21,684
he will not be able
to wield this amount of power.

587
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,444
We will then destroy the network.

588
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:25,564
Noted, Your Lordship.

589
00:27:26,804 --> 00:27:29,444
Do not write off the royal family yet.

590
00:27:29,883 --> 00:27:31,643
If he's from the royal family,

591
00:27:31,643 --> 00:27:33,204
it means he's accumulating power

592
00:27:33,964 --> 00:27:35,123
to overthrow me.

593
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:37,483
We need to nip his plan in the bud.

594
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:38,724
Yes, Your Lordship.

595
00:27:39,204 --> 00:27:41,243
Your Lordship, you used
House of Jade as bait.

596
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:43,003
I'm sure

597
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:45,523
he has received your message.

598
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:48,444
Besides, we have set everything up.

599
00:27:48,643 --> 00:27:51,003
We just have to make him
walk into the trap.

600
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:53,924
My fellow countrymen!

601
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:54,924
(Missing Person Poster)
Come have a look.

602
00:27:55,204 --> 00:27:56,444
These people have gone missing.

603
00:27:56,684 --> 00:27:57,883
If you see them

604
00:27:58,084 --> 00:27:59,044
and can drop a tip,

605
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:00,763
you will be rewarded.

606
00:28:01,523 --> 00:28:02,724
Have a look!

607
00:28:02,924 --> 00:28:03,363
Come.

608
00:28:03,564 --> 00:28:04,763
If you see them...

609
00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:06,084
Making a scene in the market

610
00:28:06,883 --> 00:28:08,363
to attract your opponent's attention.

611
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,763
Only you can come up with this.

612
00:28:10,003 --> 00:28:10,924
Everyone loves money.

613
00:28:11,444 --> 00:28:12,964
Money is the quickest way
to achieve one's goal.

614
00:28:13,564 --> 00:28:15,283
This is what I learned from you.

615
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:16,684
You see.

616
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:18,324
You're almost running out of money.

617
00:28:18,684 --> 00:28:19,964
No one has taken the bait yet.

618
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:22,003
If you can drop a tip,

619
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:23,643
you will be rewarded.

620
00:28:24,444 --> 00:28:25,804
- Here they are.
- Spread the news.

621
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:26,883
You're disrupting the public order.

622
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:27,324
Back off.

623
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:27,883
Bring them in.

624
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:28,643
Back off.

625
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:29,283
Move aside.

626
00:28:29,363 --> 00:28:30,924
Take down the people
and the noticeboard.

627
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:32,084
Back off.

628
00:28:34,243 --> 00:28:35,643
Move! Hurry!

629
00:28:35,643 --> 00:28:36,243
I'm on the move.

630
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,600
(Ministry of Justice)

631
00:28:43,643 --> 00:28:44,684
Move. Quick.

632
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,440
(Ministry of Justice)

633
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:54,560
(Ministry of Justice)

634
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,985
(Ministry of Justice)

635
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:05,274
(Ministry of Justice)

636
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:10,985
(Ministry of Justice)

637
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,336
(Ministry of Justice)

638
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:46,363
Come out now.

639
00:30:10,043 --> 00:30:12,363
I seek clarifications, Your Highness.

640
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:13,764
Go ahead, Mentor.

641
00:30:15,284 --> 00:30:16,484
Your Highness,

642
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:18,524
if your identity is revealed

643
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:20,964
and His Lordship knows you're the owner

644
00:30:20,964 --> 00:30:21,883
of Fountain Abode,

645
00:30:22,484 --> 00:30:24,284
he will be suspicious of you.

646
00:30:24,403 --> 00:30:26,004
He will think you're seditious.

647
00:30:26,123 --> 00:30:27,244
He hates being lied to

648
00:30:28,204 --> 00:30:29,164
so he will be furious.

649
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:31,924
Prince Ju

650
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:33,403
will seize this opportunity

651
00:30:33,603 --> 00:30:35,123
to add insult to injury.

652
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:38,924
If you are aware of this,

653
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,524
why are you taking this risk,
Your Highness?

654
00:30:40,803 --> 00:30:43,164
It is an emergency.

655
00:30:43,643 --> 00:30:46,244
You should lay low for the moment.

656
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,284
Do not stay on the front line

657
00:30:48,603 --> 00:30:50,484
lest they find something about you.

658
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:51,244
Besides,

659
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:52,603
House of Jade

660
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:54,883
is full of people ready to die for you.

661
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:56,724
They will not snitch you out.

662
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:59,123
Why don't you wait
until the storm is over

663
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,524
before taking your revenge?

664
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:03,363
Mentor.

665
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:05,964
I built Fountain Abode

666
00:31:06,684 --> 00:31:08,043
to protect others.

667
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:09,123
Besides,

668
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:10,843
I have grown up.

669
00:31:11,563 --> 00:31:14,323
I can protect myself and the people
around me.

670
00:31:16,444 --> 00:31:17,164
Found it.

671
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:19,484
Those who are arrested

672
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,484
were sent from Zhang Zhongge's office
in the Ministry of Justice

673
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:23,643
to a private residence 50 meters
to the eastern outskirt.

674
00:31:24,403 --> 00:31:25,684
Official Zhang
from the Ministry of Justice?

675
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:28,244
He's close to His Lordship.

676
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,883
So the mastermind is His Lordship?

677
00:31:31,843 --> 00:31:33,043
Yes, it's my father.

678
00:31:34,524 --> 00:31:36,244
You already knew?

679
00:31:48,403 --> 00:31:49,164
I was told

680
00:31:49,164 --> 00:31:50,643
my father has heard

681
00:31:50,964 --> 00:31:52,323
of Lanxi's extraordinary feats.

682
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:54,244
He isn't too happy about it.

683
00:31:54,643 --> 00:31:55,323
Nice move there, Your Highness.

684
00:31:55,877 --> 00:31:58,078
Our plan is going swimmingly.

685
00:31:58,423 --> 00:31:59,120
Anyone from House of Jade

686
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:00,363
is willing to testify?

687
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:01,790
They are being interrogated as we speak.

688
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,600
None has given in

689
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,439
but they are definitely
guilty of treason.

690
00:32:05,763 --> 00:32:07,803
Soon, they will serve their sentence.

691
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,730
Force him out.

692
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,089
Ju, you will take the lead.

693
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:17,970
Circulate the news

694
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:20,730
that if he doesn't appear
within the next three days,

695
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,121
all his subordinates will be killed.

696
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:26,329
Zhang Zhongge and you
will be watching closely nearby

697
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,369
and will be setting up a trap.

698
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:29,770
We will then wait for our prey.

699
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,289
Yes, Father.

700
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:34,569
I snuck into the Imperial City
to investigate

701
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:37,770
but I realized I was being tailed.

702
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:40,970
Therefore, I played along

703
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,450
and tailed them back.

704
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:46,490
In their residence,

705
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,170
I found this letter.

706
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:51,450
It's a wordless letter.

707
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,049
There should be codes on it

708
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,760
and the sender

709
00:32:55,569 --> 00:32:57,730
must be the mastermind.

710
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,569
If this is related
to the Locust and the Cricket,

711
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,730
then it is related to world peace.

712
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:05,730
After this thing is over,

713
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,889
I'll let my people of Fountain Abode

714
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:08,369
investigate it.

715
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,289
Thanks, Your Highness.

716
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:13,049
Your Highness,

717
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,289
I have news.

718
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,329
Prince Ju entered the palace
and told His Lordship

719
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:18,849
that if the owner of Fountain Abode
did not show himself,

720
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,210
the people in House of Jade

721
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,010
would all die after three days.

722
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:24,569
After three days?

723
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:27,369
I knew it was Feng Ju.

724
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:29,849
He wants me to fight against my father

725
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,210
and he gets to reap the benefit.

726
00:33:36,136 --> 00:33:37,136
What should we do

727
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:38,730
next?

728
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:42,609
(Something's off.)

729
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,889
(A rash decision
might lead me to the trap.)

730
00:33:59,569 --> 00:34:00,690
I plan

731
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,369
to save the people of House of Jade.

732
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,089
Father, this is a serious matter.

733
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:08,170
Shouldn't you discuss this
with Martial Sister or Mr. Feng?

734
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:09,930
Don't tell them.

735
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,530
They don't want to burden us

736
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:13,730
and won't let us act on it.

737
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:16,530
However, Tianshuang Sect
has always defended justice.

738
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,049
We cannot stand still

739
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,049
while something inhumane
unfolds before us.

740
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,569
Let us be the owners

741
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,569
of Fountain Abode.

742
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,410
Do not put Mr. Feng in a tight spot.

743
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:32,170
It's the only way
to keep all parties intact.

744
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,049
Yes, Master.

745
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:43,129
Your Highness, Tianshuang Sect
is on the move.

746
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,129
All is as you predicted.

747
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,450
Good.

748
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:50,129
Now, we stand and watch.

749
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,730
(Lanxi,)

750
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,049
(it's your move next.)

751
00:34:58,649 --> 00:34:59,410
Move aside.

752
00:35:05,649 --> 00:35:06,170
Move aside!

753
00:35:19,049 --> 00:35:20,609
This isn't the route to the palace.

754
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:23,289
Someone wants to see you.

755
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,970
Do not speak, Your Highness.

756
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:32,809
You can save it

757
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,170
for later.

758
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,679
Lanxi,

759
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,560
you have returned.

760
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:58,600
Have a seat.

761
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,606
(Room of Serenity)

762
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,919
Between us,

763
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:10,600
let's have a talk.

764
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,320
How long ago was it
since we last drank together?

765
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:24,520
A decade I presume.

766
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,760
Ever since you pretended to be sick.

767
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,223
(Room of Serenity)

768
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:34,879
That year

769
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,719
was also the year Hei Fengxi
appeared in the martial arts world.

770
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,719
Has it been a decade?

771
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,199
Like an arrow,

772
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,959
how time flies.

773
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,320
Indeed.

774
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,879
A decade has gone by.

775
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,120
I have achieved nothing

776
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,919
but you, Lanxi, have been busy.

777
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:57,239
I want to rest too

778
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,120
but some business remains unfinished.

779
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:02,479
For a decade, I can't sleep well.

780
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:04,959
However,

781
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,479
I had a wonderful sleep last night.

782
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,879
For once, I came to terms
with many things

783
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,760
and I have made a lot of decisions.

784
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:15,399
Lanxi, are you trying
to come clean to Father now?

785
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,479
If Father knows

786
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:19,520
you're the owner of Fountain Abode,

787
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,919
will he still care that you're his son?

788
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,040
You don't have any proof.

789
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:27,159
Why should I turn myself in?

790
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:27,439
Why should I turn myself in?

791
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,360
You're just trying to give me a scare.

792
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,199
Haven't you received

793
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,360
the news that people in House of Jade
will be executed soon?

794
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:38,760
Unless

795
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,560
you don't care about them?

796
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:43,199
Oh, right.

797
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,959
You look all virtuous from the surface

798
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,199
but deep down,
you couldn't care less about others.

799
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:50,120
I wonder how despair

800
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,199
your followers will feel.

801
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,560
Father gave you three days

802
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:58,120
(Room of Serenity)
to identify the owner of Fountain Abode.

803
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,159
I will give him three days too.

804
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:01,760
In your opinion,

805
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,080
between the power Fountain Abode holds

806
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:08,520
and the life of Yongzhou's Third Prince,

807
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:10,879
which one does he cherish more?
