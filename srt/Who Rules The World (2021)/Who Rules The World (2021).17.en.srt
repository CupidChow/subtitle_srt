I'm sure you must be able

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,440
to see what I did from above.

23
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:52,239
I wonder if you would
be glad to see them

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,440
or would you abhor them?

25
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,880
In fact, ever since you left,

26
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,960
I've long been all alone
without anyone to rely on.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,800
However, I refused to surrender to fate.

28
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,279
I want to fight as well.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,839
Mother.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,399
I've met someone

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,800
that reminds me of you.

32
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,960
After I met her,

33
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,559
I could feel warmth in my heart.

34
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,000
It was as though you were alive.

But I was a little scared

37
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,199
at first.

38
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,679
I was worried she might distract me.

39
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,479
But still, I couldn't let go.

40
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:05,240
When she was around,

41
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,759
I felt confident.

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,880
That is good.

(Feng Chang's Residence)

45
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,839
Your Highness,

46
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,639
Queen Baili has sent you

47
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,880
the wedding gown.

48
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,639
She wants you to try it out.

49
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,960
If it's uncomfortable,

50
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:57,440
I'll order the tailor to
make some adjustments.

51
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,080
The gown can be
changed to fit the body,

52
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,399
but when there is no love,

53
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,119
how can that be changed?

54
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,880
Forget about trying it on.

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,440
Whatever happens,

56
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:15,119
I'll have to put it on anyway.

57

58
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,040
Dismissed.

59
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,160
My mother is very thoughtful.

60
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,920
Tomorrow,

61
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,880
we're holding a memorial ceremony
for the late queen,

62
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,079
but she is still concerned about me.

63
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,839
How thoughtful of her.

64
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,200
She wants what's best for you, Your Highness.

65
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,079
Uncle De.

66
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,079
Have you convinced yourself

67
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,600
of your own lies?

68
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:46,760
I wouldn't dare.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,679
However...

70
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm going out.

71
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,799
Your Highness.

72
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,600
Check out the fabrics!

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,119

Look at these!

79
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,239
They seem interesting.

80
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,160
This looks pretty.

81
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,480
Buy one.

82
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,200
This is great!

83
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,040
(There is certainly more freedom)

84
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:36,160
(living as a martial artist.)

85
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:46,279
Look at this.

86
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,200
It doesn't look good on you.

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,920
Why not?

88
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,359
It's you again.

89
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:54,320
What are the odds?

90
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,119
It's almost New Year.

91
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,679
I have been busy.

92
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,559
I came out for some fresh air.

93
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,200
We've known each other for so long,

94
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,040
but I still don't know
what you do for a living.

95
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,440
We are a small sect.

96
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,200
We are only visiting.

97
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,839
Do you have other friends

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,279
from the martial arts world
in the capital of Yongzhou?

99
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,119
I mean,

100
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,679
if it isn't too much trouble,

101
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,559
could I have the honor to meet them?

102
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,799
I long for a life such as theirs.

103
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,720
Do you not know what danger
lies in their path?

104
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,480
It's best you don't know these people.

105
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,839
The martial arts world may be perilous,

106
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,480
-but there is freedom.
-Sir,

107
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,000
Uncle De requests you to return.

108
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,320
He needs you to check the wedding litter

109
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,320
in person.

110
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,839
Understood. You may go now.

111
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:39,880
Yes.

112
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,239
Are you getting married?

113
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,920
You're getting married!
Congratulations.

114
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,320
It isn't something worth celebrating.

115
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,359
It was my mother's decision.

116
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,839
There goes the saying,

117
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,200
"A child's marriage

118
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,880
is the parents' duty and decision."

119
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,279
However, this will decide

120
00:06:58,679 --> 00:06:59,480
the rest of your life.

121
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,359
If you don't love her,

122
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,920
neither of you will be happy.

123
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,480
Life is short.

124
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,559
Decades pass

125
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,760
in a blink of an eye.

126
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,920
Sometimes, we mustn't compromise.

127
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:11,559
If you ever need help

128
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,119
while you're in the capital,

129
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,600
you could let me know.

130
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,839
So long.

131
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,239
It's the 31st year of the Chunxi Reign.

132
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,239
Respectfully, we have prepared
food and wine

133
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,279
as our offering

134
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:43,000
to the benevolent, wise, dedicated,
and intelligent late Queen Shengchun.

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,440
Her heart was ever so generous.

136
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,600
She was a great exemplar
in the Queen's Palace.

137
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,559
Her passing had dulled
even the moonlight.

138
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,119
Many were overcome with grief.

139
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:54,119
Spring had become dreary.

140
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,359
It was a great loss
for the royal family.

141
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,559
Offering from His Lordship.

142
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,079
May the late queen accept our offering

143
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
and be pleased with it.

144
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,239
Offering from Prince Yongping.

145
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:40,840
May your spirit be pleased
with our offering.

146
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,440
Offering from the Second Queen.

147
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,520
If your spirit could hear me,

148
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,359
please accept my offering.

149
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,520
Noble Consort Baili comes
from a humble background.

150
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,599
Please reconsider, Your Lordship.

151
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,840
That's her. Have you heard the rumors?

152
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,640
The gold-digger.

153
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:35,719
That's her.

154
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,640
That seems nice.

155
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,760
Indeed.

156
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,280
Your Highness?

157
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,559
Your Highness?

158
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,479
Mother, what's wrong?

159
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,119
Get up.

160
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,840
Stop standing there.

161
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,719
End this ceremony.

162
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,359
Silence.

163
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,359
The ceremony is not over.

164
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,280
Mother, come with me.

165
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,280
Offerings from the officials!

166
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:42,520
Your Lordship,

167
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,200
I didn't mean it.

168
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,840
I know.

169
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,440
I don't blame you.

170
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:49,359
Those officials are insolent!

171
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,359
I would never disrespect Yige.

172
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:53,159
My hand slipped,

173
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:54,440
but they insisted on saying

174
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,359
I had embarrassed the entire nation!

175
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,119
I will punish them.

176
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,679
Your body is frail.

177
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't dwell on the incident.

178
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,640
Rest well.

179
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,080
What about those rude civilians?

180
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,200
They are saying

181
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,719
it's divine retribution.

182
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,080
Your Lordship,

183
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,159
help me.

184
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,000
That's enough.

185
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,880
You feel humiliated today,

186
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,080
but what about me?

187
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,960
I had told you many times

188
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,239
the ceremony must be
carried out flawlessly,

189
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,080
but you couldn't even
hold a wine cup properly!

190
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,280
What was wrong with you?

191
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,679
I was overwhelmed by fatigue.

192
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,280
The ancestral temple was cold.

193
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,200
Is it colder than the Cold Palace?

194
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,119
Your Lordship,

195
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,080
this can't be serious.

196
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:44,919
Do you know

197
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,000
why I didn't reprimand you
in front of the people?

198
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,960
I have an image to uphold!

199
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,840
You came from a lowly background.

200
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,440
I argued with the officials
for six months

201
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
to finally be able

202
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,239
to crown you the new queen.

203
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,880
It's my duty

204
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,520
to take care of your embarrassment!

205
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,960
However,

206
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,640
my effort to care for you
has been left unanswered.

207
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,960
It did nothing but bolstered
your arrogance!

208
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,440
Perhaps

209
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,760
you've enjoyed the title
of a queen for so long

210
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,919
that you forget who you really are.

211
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,840
Your Lordship!

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,640
I've shown you love for two decades.

213
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,320
I've spoiled you into a fool!

214
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,080
You interfered with the court affairs

215
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
and caused disruptions.

216
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,799
Your embarrassed the nation!

217
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,479
I took pity on you

218
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:37,159
for the hardship you went through.

219
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,440
I turned a blind eye to your scheming,

220
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,960
but your ambition grew by the day.

221
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,440
How dare you try to

222
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,960
usurp the title of my heir for your son!

223
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:50,400
Are you so eager to watch me die

224
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,320
so you can be the queen dowager?

225
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,640
Your Lordship!

226
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,479
I wouldn't dare in a million years!

227
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,520
So tell me, why have you

228
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,200
ignored my warnings?

229
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,359
Do you think I wouldn't find

230
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,119
the mastermind

231
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:05,599
of the royal examination scandal
because you played the fool?

232
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,679
Are you not worried

233
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,440
I will track down
the missing funding used

234
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,719
for the horse trading?

235
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,880
There is nothing

236
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,080
I cannot give you

237
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,760
or take from you.

238
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:26,159
Send out my decree.

239
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,520
Due to her gratitude for
her bond with the late queen,

240
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:33,320
Queen Baili will go into seclusion
and fast for the next 30 days

241
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,840
to pray for the late queen's afterlife.

242
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,379
(Everlasting Virtues)

243
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,239
Your Highness, we received reports

244
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,359
that Queen Baili has been grounded.

245
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,840
Understood.

246
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:03,359
I came to the palace at a young age.

247
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,520
I've been with Your Highness
and the late queen since then.

248
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,679
Now that Your Highness
has won against Queen Baili,

249
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,479
the late queen would be very pleased.

250
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,200
I will carry out her dying wish

251
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,719
and serve Your Highness
for the rest of my life.

252
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,919
Miss Huan,

253
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:19,960
I know you are loyal

254
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,640
to my mother.

255
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,520
You are an adult now.

256
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,400
If there is someone you love...

257
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,679
My loyalty has never wavered.

258
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,039
I will serve you until
I draw my last breath.

259
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:33,880
I will never leave.

260
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,039
I'm not banishing you.

261
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:38,760
Calm down.

262
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,159
I came to the Palace as a child.

263
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,239
I've served you since I came of age.

264
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:44,799
The life outside is not for me.

265
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,479
Please, have mercy on me.

266
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,400
Very well.

267
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,400
You may go now.

268
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,559
Thank you, Your Highness.

269
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,680
(Everlasting Virtues)

270
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,520
Have a look around!

271
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,440
Accessories and ornaments!

272
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,520
We didn't

273
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,000
get to see the capital of Yongzhou last time.

274
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,000
The capital of Yongzhou
is more exciting than I expected.

275
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,280
Master wants us

276
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,919
to buy some goods for New Year.

277
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,440
Don't forget why we're here.

278
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,919
Just let her have some fun.

279
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,960
Master made it back in one piece.

280
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,239
She is overjoyed by his return.

281
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,239
You know me the best.

282
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,039
Martial Sister,

283
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,039
do you know

284
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:53,359
why I insisted on celebrating
New Year in this capital

285
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,679
and sent a notice

286
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,640
to summon all the disciples?

287
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,679
It's almost New Year

288
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,880
and Master is wounded.

289
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,080
Our best option is to stay
in the capital of Yongzhou.

290
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,760
My father is wounded,

291
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,319
but he's more than capable

292
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,319
of going home.

293
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,119
So, why are we staying?

294
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,520
Do you not know?

295
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,680
Is it because of me?

296
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,479
Lu Shi,

297
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,439
let's buy them some snacks.

298
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:18,160
Let's go.

299
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,160
My father is giving you a chance

300
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,599
to quench your yearning.

301
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:27,880
Wait.

302
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,040
What yearning?

303
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,239
Don't be silly.

304
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,520
I'm serious.

305
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,640
Can't you tell from the way
Hei Fengxi looks at you?

306
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,199
Don't you like him?

307
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,280
Langhua,

308
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,640
enough with this nonsense.

309
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,839
The Black Foxy and I

310
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,599
are just friends.

311
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,280
Is that so?

312
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,239
Why do you treat him differently?

313
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,640
That's because...

314
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:56,040
That depends on the person.

315
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,640
I have this urge to challenge him
when I see him.

316
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,599
So, I treat him differently.

317
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,000
It's the same way with you,

318
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,920
Lu Shi, and Jiurong.

319
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,119
If I treated Jiurong
the way I treated you,

320
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,439
wouldn't you be jealous?

321
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,319
Come on, don't be silly.

322
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,000
What is he doing here?

323
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,280
Martial Sister!

324
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,760
We bought a lot of snacks.

325
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,800
-Martial Sister.
-Let's go.

326
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,719
There are more over there.

327
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:23,199
Let's check them out.

328
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:23,880
Come on.

329
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,040
Let's go.

330
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,239
We found Bai Fengxi.

331
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,839
Keep an eye on her.

332
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,760
Yes.

333
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,280
But this time,

334
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,839
we suffered heavy losses.

335
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,199
The Soultaker Sect

336
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,680
was almost wiped out.

337
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:41,800
The Han family's medicines,

338
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,640
Xuanyuan Sect's formation,

339
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:45,599
the Tie family's cast iron,

340
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,359
and the Ma family's secret manual,

341
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,880
I have everything.

342
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,640
Is there any purpose

343
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,119
for the Soultaker Sect to exist?

344
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,680
The Soultaker Sect

345
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,760
was formed based on the legend
of the Locust and Cricket.

346
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,000
Without me,

347
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,640
you could only dream of
leading this sect.

348
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,599
Forgo what you must.

349
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,079
Do not forget

350
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,680
our true goal.

351
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,520
Understood.

352
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,839
I went to Mount Wu

353
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,599
for the Sacred Jade Moon.

354
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
But it fell into the hands

355
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:20,599
of the Hei-Bai Fengxi.

356
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,599
It seems things are

357
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,800
more complicated than I think.

358
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,680
We should spend more time

359
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
in the capital of Yongzhou.

360
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:35,839
Am I beautiful?

361
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,040
Your Highness,
you are ever so elegant and gorgeous.

362
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,079
No one here can match your beauty.

363
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,719
In this palace,

364
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,000
even Royal Consort Xu
of the lowest rank

365
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,959
is more prestigious than me,
the daughter of a fabric merchant.

366
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,680
You may speak freely.

367
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,479
After the recent memorial ceremony,

368
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,800
people now know about
my past as a lowly civilian

369
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,280
even though I had spent years

370
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,599
making everyone forget.

371
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,239
That's Feng Lanxi's goal.

372
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,079
If I could

373
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,439
become a queen all those years ago,

374
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,000
I certainly wouldn't

375
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,599
let anyone look down on me again.

376
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,640
Your Highness!

377
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,000
What are you doing?

378
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,839
I'm not trying to end my life.

379
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,920
His Lordship wants me
to fast for a month.

380
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,079
I might as well do more
by copying scriptures with my blood.

381
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,880
Let's see if anyone
would still look down on me!

382
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,400
Your Highness, you mustn't do this!

383
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,760
The physician said
you were suffering from anemia.

384
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,920
I simply need a wound to fool them all.

385
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,560
There are plenty of
pet birds in the palace.

386
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:04,839
Since I'm grounded,

387
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,680
I can't leave the palace.

388
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,199
Chamberlain,

389
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,599
I need you to go out.

390
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,359
Tell my brother

391
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,319
the marriage between Duke Qi's daughter

392
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,800
and Prince Chang must
be settled before New Year.

393
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,439
Yes, Your Highness.

394
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,680
Your Highness.

395
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,839
A message from Queen Baili.

396
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,599
She wants you to finish
the betrothal proposal

397
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,119
and submit it to His Lordship.

398
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,000
Understood.

399
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,079
Prince Yongping sent you a present.

400
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,119
The messenger says

401
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,359
it's information about Duke Qi's family.

402
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:46,839
According to him,

403
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,880
he wants Your Highness
to follow the heart's calling.

404
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,880
If Your Highness decides
to marry Miss Qi Cheng,

405
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,199
there is some information

406
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:57,439
you may use as leverage
in your marriage.

407
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:07,674
(To my brother: Feng Chang)

408
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,199
(Life is short.)

409
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,280
Decades pass

410
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,479
in a blink of an eye.

411
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,640
Sometimes, we mustn't compromise.

412
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:27,839
Your Highness.

413
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
Where are you going?

414
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:31,520
My mother has been grounded.

415
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,479
It's only right for me to visit her.

416
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:35,839
But...

417
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,400
Your Highness,

418
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,239
Prince Chang is here.

419
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,239
Let him in.

420
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,479
Yes.

421
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,760
Greetings, Mother.
May you live well and be blessed.

422
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,599
You found out

423
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,880
your father has grounded me.

424
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,959
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

425
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
What happened to your hand?

426
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,520
I drew some blood to copy scriptures.

427
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,599
Now you know what I went through.

428
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,239
Just not that long ago,

429
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,959
I traveled far and wide for
Buddhist prayer on your father's behalf.

430
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,800
And now,

431
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,040
the slightest mistake

432
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,079
warranted such punishment for me.

433
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:25,079
He is ever so unpredictable.

434
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,160
Come on.

435
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:36,880
That is precisely

436
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,000
why I'm so concerned with your marriage.

437
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,199
Your father has become
even more unpredictable lately.

438
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,400
I'm at the end of my rope.

439
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,359
I could lose my life

440
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,520
at any moment.

441
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,880
You and your brother
will have to fend for yourselves.

442
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,520
I must find each of you

443
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,439
a partner that will care for you.

444
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,119
Only that will put my mind to ease.

445
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,319
I check the calendar.

446
00:23:57,719 --> 00:24:00,319
Every day until the end of this month
is a good date.

447
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,439
Pick a date

448
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,959
and ask for your father's consent
to the betrothal proposal.

449
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:08,400
Tell him you and Duke Qi's daughter
are love at first sight.

450
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,000
He will grant you this request.

451
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:10,800
Mother.

452
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,640
I have no plan to marry
Duke Qi's daughter.

453
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,680
Now is not the time to throw a tantrum!

454
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,359
I am not throwing a tantrum.

455
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,760
I am visiting you

456
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,000
because I want to tell you

457
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,599
I changed my mind.

458
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,760
I don't care

459
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,160
whose daughters you're
matchmaking me with,

460
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,959
as long as it's your decision,

461
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:34,040
I will never marry any of them.

462
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:36,439
I won't lie to myself anymore.

463
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Rest well and heal, Mother.

464
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,520
I take my leave now.

465
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,520
Stop right there!

466
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:54,839
Stop!

467
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,640
What is wrong with you again this time?

468
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,959
I ordered Duke Qi to prepare
the dowry for your wedding.

469
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,520
This is your marriage,
not a child's play!

470
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,040
When you got flustered,
you forgot you were a mother.

471
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:09,040
You saw yourself as the queen again.

472
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:10,119
Are you saying

473
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,920
you will make me fulfill
the wedding by force?

474
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,000
Feng Chang!

475
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,920
Mother!

476
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,640
Manners matter in the palace.

477
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,959
The servants are watching.

478
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,239
Come with me to my room.

479
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,920
We can talk this out.

480
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,239
There is nothing to talk about.

481
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,599
Your Highness,

482
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,640
do you really think

483
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,359
I was ignorant of

484
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:39,119
why you're suddenly treating me
with such motherly love?

485
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,839
You want me to marry Duke Qi's daughter

486
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,640
and make enemies with Feng Lanxi.

487
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:47,280
I've played the filial son for too long.

488
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,280
I'm tired of it.

489
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:51,199
I should never have had

490
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,760
those meaningless dreams.

491
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,520
You only have one son,

492
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,000
and his name is Feng Ju.

493
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,719
Do you think you can get away so easily?

494
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,280
Do you think when I was defeated,

495
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,839
Feng Lanxi would spare you from misery?

496
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,599
Do you really think
he sees you as his kin?

497
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,319
From what I learned,

498
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,319
you chased him out of your residence

499
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,599
when he visited you.

500
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,520
It seems the two of you

501
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,359
aren't that close.

502
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,160
I can't force you into submission.

503
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,520
However, I can bring you down with me.

504
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,959
I had plotted against Feng Lanxi.

505
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,400
If your father found out

506
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,400
you were part of the plotting,

507
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,560
who do you think he would believe?
You, or me?

508
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,599
I thought you merely disliked me.

509
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,719
As it turned out, you hated me.

510
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,280
We are mother and son.

511
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,760
You should have seen this coming,

512
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,280
am I right?

513
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,520
Do not force my hand.

514
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,920
If I got desperate,

515
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,959
I would tell the world
about your epilepsy.

516
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,479
A repulsive condition that disgusts all,

517
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,319
should ruin your reputation
in the court for good.

518
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,439
Chang.

519
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,040
We are in the same boat.

520
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:25,160
You will never come out unscathed.

521
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,719
I bet you must hate me to the bone.

522
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,880
It's not like you can
do anything about it.

523
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:33,319
Do as I say.

524
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,520
I know.

525
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:37,359
You and Feng Lanxi are very close.

526
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:40,000
If you help me with my plan,

527
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,839
you have my word

528
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,040
that I will never trouble you again.

529
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,680
It's not just you.

530
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:51,000
Pretending to be your loving mother

531
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,920
is just as revolting for me.

532
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,040
Look at you!

533
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,800
The thought of getting married

534
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,319
has got you so excited.

535
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,239
Go back to your residence.

536
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,000
I'll have everything arranged for you.

537
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:33,800
Your Highness.

538
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,520
Submit it for me.

539
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,181
(Southern Market)

540
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,285
(Stellar Talent)

541
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,359
What brings you here?

542
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,719
Am I not welcome here?

543
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,920
Master invited him.

544
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:22,920
This capital is such a merry place.

545
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,280
Three of the Four Gentry

546
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,199
are gathered here.

547
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,719
Yu Wuyuan is in the capital?

548
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,359
Yes.

549
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:28,880
Martial Sister and I even saw him

550
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,680
on the street.

551
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,839
Martial Sister,
I'll lead Mr. Feng inside.

552
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,319
Master is waiting for him.

553
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,040
Go ahead.

554
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,319
Master Bai,

555
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,400
why have you summoned me?

556
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:49,280
I need the Fountain Abode

557
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,640
for an investigation.

558
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,079
You may speak freely.

559
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,839
You will have full support
from the Fountain Abode.

560
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,680
This is the fake token
Huang Chao tried to return.

561
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,520
This wasn't the token Yan Yingzhou had.

562
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,599
There was another fake token?

563
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,239
Master Bai,

564
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,119
why are you interested in a fake?

565
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,800
Have you heard of the Token Keepers?

566
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,760
Rumor has it that
the Imperial Family of Dadong Empire

567
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,400
has powerful martial artists

568
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
to protect the Empyrean Token.

569
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,040
They are known as the Token Keepers.

570
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,800
Master Bai,

571
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,760
you are one of them.

572
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,359
The Token Keepers

573
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:45,000
are not only charged with
protecting the token

574
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,719
but also

575
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:48,479
limiting the Imperial Family's power.

576
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:51,359
When Xi returned

577
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,040
to the Tianshuang Sect,

578
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,680
she told me all about Yan Yingzhou

579
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,880
and the fake token.

580
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,719
I wrote a letter

581
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,760
to inform another Token Keeper.

582
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
It was Wang Shuilong.

583
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,439
In his letter, he mentioned

584
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:07,160
the other fake token he found.

585
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:09,280
To meet him,

586
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
I went to Mount Wu.

587
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,119
I see.

588
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,319
I need you to find out

589
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,000
who is behind all of this

590
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,439
and why they are using fake tokens
to cause confusion.

591
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,000
I will investigate.

592
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,920
Do not tell Xi for the time being.

593
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,199
I don't want her to worry.

594
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:30,000
I understand.

595
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,479
Go on.

596
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,680
Someone is expecting you.

597
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:36,959
I shall

598
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,760
take my leave now.

599
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,079
What did you and Master talk about?

600
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,520
I promised him

601
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,079
not to tell you.

602
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,319
How mysterious.

603
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,599
Keep the secret to yourself, then.

604
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:54,520
It's not like I'd love to know.

605
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,599
Why are we here?

606
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,760
To keep my father and
Queen Baili from knowing

607
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,719
that I know martial art,

608
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,599
I would come here every night

609
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,800
to practice in secret.

610
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,560
Were you

611
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,239
very lonely?

612
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:22,800
Indeed.

613
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,719
Even with the bustling city below,

614
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,160
I couldn't help but feel lonely.

615
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,959
I kept telling myself

616
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,280
I had to endure that loneliness

617
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,680
to realize my goal.

618
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:45,680
What is your goal?

619
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:50,680
At first,

620
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,839
I wanted to protect myself.

621
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,599
Then,

622
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,439
I wanted to become my father's heir.

623
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:58,560
And then,

624
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,520
I want to conquer the world.

625
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,479
Next...

626
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,719
What's next?

627
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
The greed is endless.

628
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,280
I told you,

629
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,520
you have a choice.

630
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,719
Why not give up on conquering the world?

631
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,599
That's because

632
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,400
this isn't how the world should be.

633
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,599
I've been drawn to people.

634
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:41,439
There are the helpless,

635
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,280
the living,

636
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,400
and those who make me feel alive.

637
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:50,439
I want all of them

638
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,079
to have a better life.

639
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,400
I'm curious.

640
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:02,040
What is the world full
of warmth and simplicity

641
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,959
that you envision?

642
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,120
What is this?

643
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,919
When I first met you,

644
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,520
I had this strange feeling

645
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,639
that our fate was intertwined.

646
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,840
As it turns out,

647
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,719
you're such a nuisance.

648
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:34,199
We are human beings,

649
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,479
it's normal to have worries.

650
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,479
To acquire the Sacred Jade Moon,

651
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,919
we must create an opening

652
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,120
and wait for both of them
to make a move.

653
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,600
Keep an eye on them.

654
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:09,760
Yes.

655
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,199
Sir.

656
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,439
Yu Wuyuan is in the capital of Yongzhou,

657
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,600
but the Fountain Abode doesn't know?

658
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,520
I'll see to it.

659
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:26,639
Watch him.

660
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:28,280
I want to know every action he takes.

661
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,280
Yes.

662
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,120
Your Highness,

663
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:33,959
a message from the palace.

664
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,639
Prince Chang has submitted
his betrothal proposal to His Lordship.

665
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,399
He is going to marry Duke Qi's daughter.

666
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,000
Is this his decision?

667
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,399
Duke Qi has been our enemy.

668
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,879
If this marriage is approved,

669
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:52,120
how should we face Prince Chang

670
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:53,479
from here on?

671
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:26,000
Brother, you're leaving me.

672
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,399
Don't worry.

673
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,199
I'll always be there with you.

674
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,719
Brother!

675
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:39,159
Perhaps he made this decision

676
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,520
because I failed him.

677
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,760
In that case,

678
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,800
we shall adapt and overcome.

679
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,239
Yes.

680
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,262
(Youzhou)

681
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:26,918
(Princess of Youzhou, Hua Chunran)

682
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,120
Greetings, Father.

683
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:39,879
Long live the Lord.

684
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,035
(Lord of Youzhou)

685
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,360
Chun, you've come.

686
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:43,120
Get up.

687
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,600
Come on. Stand up.

688
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,280
Thank you, Father.

689
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,520
You two, dismissed.

690
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,199
Father, why am I summoned?

691
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,159
I haven't seen you in a while.

692
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,360
I wanted to see you.

693
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,600
Earlier today,

694
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,760
a batch of silk gauze
was sent here as a tribute.

695
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:03,600
You may use them

696
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:06,239
for your new dresses.

697
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,959
Thank you, Father.

698
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:08,919
Come, have a seat.

699
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:12,399
Father, I've missed you.

700
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,479
But you're always busy with work.

701
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,520
I barely have any chances to serve you.

702
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,719
This is all thanks to your
good-for-nothing brothers.

703
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,600
They can't help me with my work.

704
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:27,760
I have to see to everything personally.

705
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:28,800
Chun.

706
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:32,760
I wish you were a man.

707
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,760
Father, my elder brothers
are all outstanding men.

708
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:38,159
It's just that you outshine them

709
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,760
by a league.

710
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,959
But still,

711
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:43,080
like father, like sons.

712
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:44,360
With enough time,

713
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,320
they will follow in your footsteps

714
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:49,399
and become lords as wise as you.

715
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,639
It's nice of you to say that.

716
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,479
I merely tell the truth.

717
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,879
But Father,

718
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:58,520
why not

719
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:00,679
leave the trivial matters
to your officials?

720
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,239
Why see to them personally?

721
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:07,239
I heard that Official Qian Qi,

722
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:10,199
Official Wang Qing,
and Official Xiang Ya from the court

723
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:11,600
are all loyal and capable

724
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,000
despite their low ranks.

725
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,159
They are the best out there.

726
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:17,000
Therefore,

727
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,320
you should task them
with greater responsibilities.

728
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:22,520
That will show the people
you value talented people

729
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:24,800
and prevent you
from overworking yourself.

730
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:27,000
You will have more time
for your children.

731
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,199
We can take better care of you.

732
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,760
That is a sound plan.

733
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,399
I'll be sure to spend more time with you

734
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:40,320
whenever I have the time.

735
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,439
However, I summoned you

736
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:45,360
because there is
a matter to be discussed.

737
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,000
You are of marrying age.

738
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,120
Isn't it time to find you a husband?

739
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,600
Are you saying I'm annoying you

740
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,520
with my presence?

741
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:00,959
Not at all!

742
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,800
Men and women should get married
when they are of age.

743
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,479
It's a big world out there.

744
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,000
If I leave the palace,

745
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,199
I might never see you again
for a very long time.

746
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,360
Well...

747
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:18,959
Chun.

748
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,280
Perhaps I could find you
a husband that takes our family name.

749
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,360
Father,

750
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,120
a real hero would never agree
to be married into a woman's family.

751
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,280
You're right.

752
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,560
Perhaps I could hold
a spouse selection contest.

753
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,600
A spouse selection contest?

754
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,439
I want only

755
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,320
the best among the men.

756
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:49,800
Find out

757
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:52,479
who suggested the idea
of maternal marriage to my father.

758
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,520
Yes.

759
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,760
I read the betrothal proposal

760
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,360
you submitted.

761
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,280
Are you sure you want to
marry Duke Qi's daughter?

762
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,679
Yes.

763
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,840
I am in love with her,

764
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,040
just as you were when you met my mother.

765
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:15,840
Very well.

766
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,879
Duke Qi is one of the
nobles of Yongzhou.

767
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,479
His child is worthy of my firstborn.

768
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:26,639
Queen Baili has done well
in this matter.

769
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:30,120
Indeed.

770
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,120
She was very concerned about me.

771
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,399
Ask the Astronomy Officer
to divine their birth date.

772
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,520
If nothing goes wrong,
we'll exchange the dowry and dower.

773
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,959
On the first day of the upcoming year,

774
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:43,520
I will grant you the betrothal decree.

775
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:46,280
Consider it a new beginning
for a new year.

776
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,560
Queen Baili's fasting

777
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:50,399
will have come to an end.

778
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,679
Much obliged, Father.

779
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,679
Send out my decree.

780
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:58,560
Feng Chang will be given the title
of Prince Yongxin.

781
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:00,199
He will be granted
a fief of 3,000 households.

782
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:01,719
Yes, Your Lordship.

783
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:04,679
Congratulations, Prince Yongxin.

784
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,919
Much obliged, Father.
