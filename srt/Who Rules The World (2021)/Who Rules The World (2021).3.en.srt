20
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:43,800
Black Foxy,

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,319
what exactly are you up to?

22
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:48,120
I thought we were going
to work with the Qi family.

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,000
Now, you taught Mr. Qi a lesson.

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
What exactly are you thinking?

25
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,639
The more powerful

26
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,559
you are in cooperation,

27
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,879
the more benefit you'll get.

28
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,599
Father, hear me out.

29
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,279
It's...

30
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,039
Father.

31
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,160
(Head of the Qi Family, Qi Yannian)
Out of everyone in Yucheng,

32
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,680
(Head of the Qi Family, Qi Yannian)
only the Shang family

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,440
(Head of the Qi Family, Qi Yannian)
would dare rub us the wrong way.

34
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,520
Not to mention it's a foreigner.

35
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,880
You mentioned

36
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,000
that young man's maidservant

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,479
managed to wound

38
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,960
Zhao Qinghou in a single strike.

39
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:33,080
He was crushed to a pulp!

40
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,360
Was there anything special

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,919
about the young man's look?

42
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:45,080
Aside from sharing
my dashing good look...

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,800
Right!

44
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:46,720
His aura.

45
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,399
He seemed very classy and smart.

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,399
He must be very fastidious.

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,800
Was his maidservant

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,679
a very carefree kind of girl?

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,240
Father, how do you know

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,119
she is the carefree kind of girl?

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,720
Father, I have but one request.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,039
Buy me the horse, please.

53
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,279
Father, look!

54
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,279
This is it! This is the horse!

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,800
This is the man, Father.

56
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:18,880
He hit me!

57
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,479
He's dressed in green,
like a piece of mung bean cake!

58
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,880
Oh, you're wearing green as well.

59
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,080
I am sorry.

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,520
Please inform your master

61
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,679
that Qi Yannian of Yucheng
and his wayward son are here

62
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,600
to apologize.

63
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,160
He knows you are coming.

64
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,320
It seems

65
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,160
you've made the right decision.

66
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,160
Gentleman,

67
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,479
I have a question.

68
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,679
What if I made the wrong decision today?

69
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,119
According to my Young Master,

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,039
if the head of the Qi family
was nothing but a fool,

71
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,800
the family should be gone from Yucheng.

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,160
I dare you to say that again!

73
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:55,639
Come in.

74
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,520
I am Qi Yannian of Yucheng.

75
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,800
My son and I are here to
apologize to you, Mr. Fengxi.

76
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
Mr. Fengxi?

77
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
You worthless child,

78
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,399
kneel!

79
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:17,760
My son is ignorant.

80
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,040
I hope you have
mercy on him, Mr. Fengxi.

81
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,480
Qi Yannian!

82
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,239
How is this a proper apology?

83
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:31,239
To express my sincerity,

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,399
I've brought you a gift.

85
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,959
It's a third of the Qi family's wealth.

86
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,320
But...

87
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,040
Speak,

88
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,119
what do you want?

89
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:51,559
I have a humble request.

90
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,160
There are two
prominent families in Yucheng,

91
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,959
namely the Qi family
and the Shang family.

92
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,359
The Shang family has sided
with the former chancellor of Shangzhou.

93
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,359
They have the letter
of sanction to sell salt.

94
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,440
Over the past years,

95
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,320
they have been
undermining me at every corner.

96
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,480
I am hoping you can

97
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,079
get the letter of sanction for me.

98
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,440
I am willing

99
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,839
to forgo a third of
the Qi family's wealth.

100
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,760
That is going to take a toll
on my family's finances and power.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,480
Sir!

102
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,679
Very well, name your price.

103
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:38,359
I want half of it.

104
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,239
Sir,

105
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,600
so be it!

106
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,920
If you want me to get
the letter from the Shang family,

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,760
I will need information.

108
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,320
The letter

109
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,799
has been in possession of
the head of the family,

110
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,239
Shang Ye.

111
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,000
On the third day of every month,

112
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,760
he visits the Lifang Parlor.

113
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,359
That's today!

114
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:08,359
I look forward to hearing
good news from you.

115
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,760
Black Foxy,

116
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,799
you've impressed me.

117
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,760
You found out where Shang Ye would be

118
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,959
and robbed the Qi family
of half of their wealth.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,480
I prefer putting my mind to good use.

120
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,760
You may go now.

121
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:31,000
We'll head for the Lifang Parlor later.

122
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,880
Sure.

123
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,720
Sir,

124
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,679
are we short on money?

125
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:52,040
With your around? Always.

126
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,530
(Lifang Parlor, Yucheng)

127
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,959
If you're here for the girls,

128
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,040
go to the first floor
and feast your eyes on them.

129
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,079
Why would you come here?

130
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,799
A higher vantage point

131
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,279
helps me find my target.

132
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:28,959
Look.

133
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,359
He's over there.

134
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,160
Is that Shang Ye?

135
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,600
(Head of the Shang Family, Shang Ye)

136
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,119
That must be the Dance of Allure.

137
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,760
That fair lady must be the Bewitcher.

138
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:51,160
Look at these thirsty men.

139
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,320
Not all men

140
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,119
are as crude as them.

141
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,880
I doubt

142
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:00,600
you're not interested at all.

143
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:08,559
Your face is turning red.

144
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,079
It's burning up.

145
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,359
Muscle contraction.

146
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,679
Rapid breathing.

147
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,600
A waste of my time.

148
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,440
Did you see the dance?

149
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,880
Yes.

150
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,320
I've visited a brothel in the past.

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,599
However,

152
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,679
I've never seen anything

153
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,000
like the dance they performed.

154
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,400
I bet there aren't

155
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,039
many places or things

156
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,320
that you haven't tried,

157
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,280
Bai Fengxi.

158
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:46,200
Am I right?

159
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,479
Black Foxy,

160
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,239
how are you any better?

161
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:52,919
Look at those beauties.

162
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
They look gorgeous in red.

163
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,440
They dance like a blooming peony,

164
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,000
alluring and bewitching,

165
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,000
and winning every man's heart.

166
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,719
Mr. Shang.

167
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,919
Please come with me
to the side chamber.

168
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,000
Miss Hong Luo

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,239
will be with you soon.

170
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,359
You're quite a gentleman.

171
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,679
Put that on.

172
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,320
Why?

173
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,640
You're going to dance.

174
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,479
Why am I dancing?

175
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,559
Aren't you investigating
the Soultaker Sect?

176
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,280
Shang Ye is your lead.

177
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,719
Put it on.

178
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,840
Be quick.

179
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,679
Black Foxy.

180
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,400
If you want me to perform
their dance from earlier,

181
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,440
well,

182
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:58,359
I can't.

183
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,479
You know how
the Soultaker Sect operates.

184
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,280
Every time we caught someone,

185
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,840
they committed
suicide by taking poison.

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,840
They refuse to say anything.

187
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
I need you to charm him

188
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,320
so he tells you the secrets
of the Soultaker Sect

189
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,080
without even realizing it.

190
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,080
Otherwise,

191
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,200
you might never find

192
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
those from the Soultaker Sect.

193
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,520
Remember,

194
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,400
make sure he shows you

195
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:19,159
the permit for selling salt.

196
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,520
As for the dance,

197
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,479
we both know if you can perform it.

198
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,400
Bai Fengxi remembers

199
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,359
everything she sees.

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,880
This dance is merely...

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,679
Curse you, Black Foxy...

202
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,799
The man in the next room
is getting impatient.

203
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,799
(An exotic dance?)

204
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,239
(I've never tried it before.)

205
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:52,640
(Since I'm only)

206
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,039
(doing it once in my entire life,)

207
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,239
(I'll do it to perfection.)

208
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:59,400
(My performance will be flawless.)

209
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,280
What is taking her so long?

210
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,320
Go and check on her.

211
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,039
Yes.

212
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,239
Miss Hong Luo arrives!

213
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:21,960
Mr. Shang.

214
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,599
Do you want the servants
to see me dance?

215
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,679
Both of you, leave us.

216
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,119
Yes.

217
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,039
(Black Foxy)

218
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,840
(clearly had a way to get
the information he sought,)

219
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:36,400
(but he sent me to dance for this man.)

220
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:37,599
(Curse him.)

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,280
Stop.

222
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,440
All right.

223
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,159
You can stop dancing now.

224
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,359
I've waited long enough.

225
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,760
Mr. Shang, don't be so hasty.

226
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,400
Young Master Qi watched me

227
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,520
perform the entire dance.

228
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,760
Are you saying

229
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,640
my dance

230
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,559
is not good enough for you?

231
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,559
No, your dance is great.

232
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,760
But more importantly, I am just...

233
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:49,200
Why can't you do as Young Master Qi did?

234
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,200
Just sit tight

235
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,760
and enjoy my dance.

236
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,080
Young Master Qi was very pleased

237
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,440
with my dance

238
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:58,039
after he watched it.

239
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,479
Enough about the man from Qi family.

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,400
What's so great about them?

241
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:05,679
Listen up.

242
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,200
The Qi family will
meet their demise soon.

243
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
Demise?

244
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,599
What do you mean?

245
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,640
I hope you're not just bluffing.

246
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,359
Me? Bluffing?

247
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,119
Let me show you something.

248
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:23,976
(Shangzhou: Permit to Sell Salt)

249
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,760
See this?

250
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,239
This is the permit
to sell salt in Shangzhou.

251
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,640
With this document,

252
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,719
the Shang family

253
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:33,520
will become richer
with each passing day!

254
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,799
The Qi family

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,239
can't do anything about it.

256
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,719
But still,

257
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,919
the Qi family is second
only to you in Yucheng.

258
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
There's more.

259
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,640
I have someone

260
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,039
to back me up.

261
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,960
Who is it?

262
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,640
The Soultaker Sect.

263
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,640
We share a very close connection and...

264
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,119
You're pretty quick.

265
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,880
This is the so-called
richest man in Shangzhou?

266
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,239
I've never seen you in this appearance.

267
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,799
I never thought...

268
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,159
That I am a beauty of unmatched charm?

269
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,599
Isn't that so?

270
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,479

00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,520
Is my beauty enough

274
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,359

00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,960
You're in no place to ask questions.

281
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,280
Answer my questions.

282
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Where is the Soultaker Sect?

283
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
You are only a businessman.

284
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,200
Why would you work with them?

285
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,039
Answer me.

286
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:34,640
Shang Ye.

287
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,799
I'm not a merciful person.

288
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,159
To get what I want,

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,799
I resort to gruesome methods.

290
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,520
Have you heard of

291
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,159
Devourment by Ants?

292
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,880
No!

293
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,599
Stop.

294
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:51,719
Kill me if you want.

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,599
Shang Ye.

296
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,719
Black Foxy here
doesn't mind taking lives.

297
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,640
Do not provoke him.

298
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,119
I understand your concerns.

299
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,280
You fear they may come after you.

300
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:01,479
But if you help us,

301
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,039
the sect will perish.

302
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,640
Give it some thoughts.

303
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,799
There is a division of the Soultaker Sect

304
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,640
here in Yucheng.

305
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,960
But I can't explain the location clearly

306
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,599
in a few words.

307
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,159
I can draw you a map.

308
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,520
Very well.

309
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,719
Go after him.

310
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,760
You learned well.

311
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,520
Following the track.
You taught me that.

312
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,440
Brother,

313
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,719
is Feng going to be all right?

314
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,599
Don't worry, Young Master Han.

315
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,599
My Young Master is with her.
She will be safe.

316
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,520
She doesn't need
your Young Master's protection.

317
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,400
Young Master Han, it's bedtime.

318
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,520
When you wake up,

319
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:15,280
they will already be back.

320
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,359
It's still too early for bedtime.

321
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,280
Sleep soundly and worry about nothing.

322
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,199
Fine.

323
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,439
This is it.

324
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,280
I bet the members of
the Soultaker Sect are ready for us.

325
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,000
Remember,

326
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,520
follow my lead.

327
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:49,839
Do not...

328
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
Do not be reckless.

329
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,079
There are eight of them this time.

330
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,239

00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:26,800
Wang Hai.

355
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,640
Young Master has ordered you
to rebuild the Yucheng hideout.

356
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,119
Yes.

357
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:44,560
Are you healed?

358
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
I adjusted my qi flow.

359
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,239
Where is he?

360
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,239
He got away.

361
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Don't be frustrated.

362
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,719
We each have different strengths.

363
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,680
Maybe he's just good at escaping.

364
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,839
Have you found anything about the sect?

365
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,239
He dropped this.

366
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,000
This pattern seems peculiar.

367
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,920
Don't you know what it is?

368
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,439
No.

369
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
What a shame.

370
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,239
Are you going to ask for
another thousand pieces of gold?

371
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,719
You don't have a choice here.

372
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,319
Say it, now.

373
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,560
Or I'm going to tear it into pieces.

374
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,160
Don't you think

375
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,199
we are very much
the same as that pattern?

376
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,479
It's called "The Locust and Cricket".

377
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,599
These two beasts look similar

378
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,160
and are inseparable.

379
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,560
The Locust and Cricket?

380
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:14,000
What's the story behind it?

381
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:18,880
I don't know either.

382
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,439
But I do know it's powerful enough

383
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:25,680
to bend the knees
of the richest man in Yucheng.

384
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,199
Whatever it is,

385
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,040
I'll get to the bottom of it.

386
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,359
The Locust and Cricket...

387
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
It's over for the time being.

388
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,880
The Soultaker Sect won't
show up for some time.

389
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:43,800
Where are you going next?

390
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,199
I'm taking Pu back
to the Tianshuang Sect.

391
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,160
I should start packing now.

392
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,643
(Yucheng, Shangzhou)

393
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,800
We finally have food!

394
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,920
It's still steaming.

395
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,560
Next.

396
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:05,479
Hold the food.

397
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,280
Sir,

398
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,319
what happened here?

399
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:10,719
A fire broke out at
the Shang family's house.

400
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,199
The house was burned to the ground.

401
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
The fire took the street too.

402
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:15,640
Many have lost their homes.

403
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,400
They are giving out food.

404
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,079
I'll have a look.

405
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,199
Go ahead.

406
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,439
It's Mr. Feng!

407
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,479
Let's go.

408
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:48,959
Speak.

409
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,479
What are you up to this time?

410
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,479
You have a prejudice against me.

411
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,239
A fire burned the Shang's residence
to the ground.

412
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,000
Shang Ye burned himself to death.

413
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,119
A fire broke,

414
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:00,680
and his wealth was burnt to the ground,

415
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,319
but he didn't commit suicide.

416
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,119
Shang Ye ran away.

417
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,439
Businessmen are cunning.

418
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,280
That's true enough about him.

419
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,280
Shang Ye is very decisive.

420
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
His action was swift.

421
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,079
He took his family with him.

422
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,079
At least he's not heartless.

423
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,439
He gave up his wealth
as if it was nothing.

424
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,239
I'll applaud his resolve.

425
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,400
You seem to know a lot.

426
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,479
Did you see it?

427
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,880
Of course.

428
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,160
I should have known.

429
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,079
You do everything

430
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:32,439
for a certain purpose.

431
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,959
You never miss any details.

432
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,040
I should have been more careful.

433
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,119
If I didn't do it,

434
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,680
I wouldn't be the Hei Fengxi you knew.

435
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,199
Judging by that tone,

436
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:44,839
the Shang family's wealth

437
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,560
is in your pocket now,

438
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,680
along with the Qi family's.

439
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:50,800
Well played, Black Foxy.

440
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,560
You then used the money for charity

441
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,280
and earned the title of a philanthropist.

442
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,920
You got the money and fame.

443
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,839
You are nothing more than

444
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,079
a scheming, cunning, evil,

445
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,800
and selfish animal.

446
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,920
Why are you still sung

447
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,119
as a hero?

448
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,680
I wonder if the people

449
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,560
are thinking straight.

450
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,040
I've never called myself

451
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,640
a kind and honorable person.

452
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,400
But the people celebrate your deeds.

453
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:17,000
You chose money over the people.

454
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:17,920
You could have

455
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,599
saved everyone from the fire.

456
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,400
You let them die just so you can plunder

457
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,000
the treasures...

458
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,040
(Those guards from that night...)

459
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:29,439
(Mr. Shang.)

460
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:32,520
Do you want the servants
to see me dance?

461
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,079
Both of you, leave us.

462
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:35,719
Yes.

463
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,439
(Black Foxy saved those guards.)

464
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,280
Well? Don't stop now.

465
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,920
Aren't you calling me
a heartless wretch?

466
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,959
Did you

467
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,239
save those guards?

468
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,719
This is a farewell for us.

469
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,959
I hope we don't meet again.

470
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:18,640
Curse that Black Foxy.

471
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,520
He must have thought

472
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,560
I was a fool just now.

473
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,119
You don't have money with you.

474
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,199
Do you need help?

475
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,040
Never mind.

476
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,119
I'm not like you.

477
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,760
I don't need a lot of money with me.

478
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,479
About just now...

479
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:39,520
I forgive you.

480
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,479
I forgive you.

481
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,319
I...

482
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:49,800
This bird is hurt.

483
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,400
Look, there is another one.

484
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,640
Another?

485
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,479
A black bird and a white bird.

486
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,760
How did they get hurt?

487
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:17,479
What?

488
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,719
One for each.

489
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,839
Black and white.

490
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,119
I don't keep pets.

491
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,719
They are both hurt.

492
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,439
If we don't take care of them,

493
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,599
they will die.

494
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,599
That is their destiny.

495
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,000
Fine.

496
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,160
I'll keep both of them.

497
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,439
Someone as privileged as you

498
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:37,439
will never understand what it's like

499
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,520
to have no mother.

500
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:39,959
Let's go.

501
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,520
I do know.

502
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,160
I lost my mother

503
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,119
when I was very young.

504
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:50,479
Sorry, Black Foxy.

505
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,199
I...

506
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:51,760
Never mind.

507
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,520
This is where we part.

508
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,359
I will look after the bird.

509
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,000
Take care.

510
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,400
May we meet again.

511
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:14,239
Goodbye.

512
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,719
I hope we don't meet again.

513
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:20,959
Let's go.

514
00:27:25,013 --> 00:27:27,498
(Tai Town, Shangzhou)

515
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,040
We're finally at Tai Town.

516
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:37,520
Feng,

517
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,400
are we almost at the Tianshuang Sect?

518
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,839
We still need to go over

519
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:42,719
a mountain.

520
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,560
You must be hungry.
Let's get you some food.

521
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,880
Feng, do you have money?

522
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:50,040
I lead a frugal lifestyle.

523
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,560
We still have one silver leaf.

524
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,319
You call that frugal?

525
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,199
Why did I even follow you?

526
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,119
This is

527
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,560
the first wrong decision in my life.

528
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,119
We can barely make ends meet.

529
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:04,160
Sometimes, you don't even
pay for the meals.

530
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,000
-But I...
-Not paying for meals?

531
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:08,239
It's horrible to starve a kid.

532
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:08,839
Keep it down.

533
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:09,959
Why should I?

534
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,520
I'll talk as loud as I want!

535
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,760
We foraged fruits from the wild

536
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,599
and drank muddy water.

537
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,439
We had no choice.

538
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:18,920
We spent the night
either under a stranger's roof

539
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,040
or hanging on a tree!

540
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,280
We even stayed in a rundown temple.

541
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,640
We barely had any shelter.
I've never had a decent day.

542
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,599
Why is

543
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:28,280
the famous Bai Fengxi flat broke?

544
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:30,160
I thought people like you

545
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,640
were respected and loaded with money.

546
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
I should have followed Hei Fengxi.

547
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,760
Even if I was sold off,

548
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:39,160
I'd get some decent meals

549
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,640
and have some sound sleep.

550
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,359
How about this?

551
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,040
I'll use this silver leaf

552
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,959
to buy as much food as you want.

553
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,319
That's more like it.

554
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:47,760
Let's go.

555
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
I'm the better choice, right?

556
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,880
Sit here.

557
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,359
Okay.

558
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,839
May I take your order?

559
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,280
Two bowls of noodles.

560
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,880
With some vinegar and seasoning.

561
00:28:59,199 --> 00:28:59,640
Okay.

562
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,079
Thanks.

563
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:05,959
Let's go.

564
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,359
Sir,

565
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:16,479
where are they coming from?

566
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,439
You mean the refugees?

567
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,880
They are from Luocheng
of the Ten Cities of Qiyun.

568
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:22,719
Ten Cities of Qiyun?

569
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:25,319
Isn't that under the jurisdiction
of the Imperial Family?

570
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,439
Troops from Shangzhou
are being sent to Luocheng.

571
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,280
These people

572
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,319
ran as hard as they could

573
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,719
to reach here.

574
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,000
Shangzhou's troops are attacking
the Imperial Family's land?

575
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,920
How is this happening?

576
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,000
The Emperor lost the Empyrean Token.

577
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,640
The forces in Shangzhou
must want to seize the throne.

578
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,439
That's why they mobilized the troops.

579
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:46,560
If the Empyrean Token caused this,

580
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,479
worse battles would come to pass.

581
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,719
Sit down.

582
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:55,479
It's been a month.

583
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,800
More refugees are pouring in.

584
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:59,680
The bun stall owner and I
could offer some help at first.

585
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,920
But right now, we barely

586
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,160
have enough food ourselves.

587
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,800
Here,

588
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,760
your noodles are ready.

589
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,359
Son, quick!

590
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,000
Get the meat buns! Go!

591
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,560
Sir, please help us!

592
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:13,920
Spare the children some food.

593
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,959
Please, my child is starving to death!

594
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,640
Stop pushing!

595
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:19,880
Sir!

596
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:21,000
What are you doing?

597
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:23,959
-My son!
-Mother!

598
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:24,640
Are you hurt?

599
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,040
Get up, madam.

600
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,239
Thank you, miss.

601
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,160
Get up.

602
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,280
Here.

603
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,920
Get up.

604
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,520
Sir.

605
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,160
Get them as many buns as I can pay

606
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,079
with this silver leaf.

607
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:38,599
Sure.

608
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,400
Thank you!

609
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:39,920
Come here!

610
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,839
Thank you!

611
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,119
There is food here!

612
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,119
Everyone, line up!

613
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:44,920
Line up! Stop pushing!

614
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,520
Feng.

615
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,280
You'll get your food.

616
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,000
Stop pushing!

617
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:48,439
Thank you.

618
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,160
Let's go.

619
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,239
We used up our money.

620
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,280
It's all right.

621
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,119
I know you will figure something out.

622
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,000
There are fruits in the wild.

623
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,800
I'll get you some.

624
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,640
Sir,

625
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,319
the border of Luocheng is up ahead.

626
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,640
We've seen

627
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,160
many refugees along the way.

628
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,640
The fights in Luocheng are escalating.

629
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,160
Should we make a detour?

630
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:18,920
That will take us another day.

631
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,400
I don't want trouble back at home.

632
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,119
We'll pass through Luocheng.

633
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:25,160
Your concern is not with the schedule.

634
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,599
We've helped plenty of
refugees along the way.

635
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:28,839
Your goal is to

636
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,560
save more people.

637
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,040
Given the circumstances,

638
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,599
we can't save Luocheng.

639
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,520
If Shangzhou manages to seize Luocheng,

640
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,160
all hell breaks loose.

641
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,560
The situation is bad,

642
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,479
but it's not the worst.

643
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,439
The Lord of Shangzhou is a fool.

644
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,520
Challenging the Imperial Family's patience...

645
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,439
is a foolish move.

646
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,959
I will not let this fool

647
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,560
ruin the world.

648
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,880
Pu,

649
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,760
you're around seven years old,

650
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,319
not 70 years old.

651
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,640
You walk like an old man.

652
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,520
You're so slow.

653
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,640
Feng, you lied to me again.

654
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,160
I didn't lie to you.

655
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,160
I told you after Tai Town,

656
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,000
we still had to go over the mountain.

657
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:17,839
Let's go.

658
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:21,000
You didn't mention how tall
the mountain was.

659
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,640
I'm starving, thirsty, and tired.

660
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,439
I'm too tired to walk.

661
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,439
You can't move at all?

662
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,040
I can't move at all.

663
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,599
Fine.

664
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:31,599
I'll find you some food.

665
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,640
Stay here.

666
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,160
Don't go anywhere.

667
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,560
Gather some firewood.

668
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,439
Nothing comes free in this world.

669
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,520
Fine.

670
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,720
(Luocheng of Dadong Empire)

(Luocheng)

673
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,839
Tell your governor

674
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,880
it'll be wise to open the gate now.

675
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,479
Otherwise, I'll have his blood
as a tribute to our flag

676
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,319
after we seize the city!

677
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,839
Relay

678
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,160
every word of my message

679
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,319
to your governor!

(Map of Dadong)
Based on what you say,

681
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,640
this is a battle we cannot win.

682
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,880
The Lord of Shangzhou
sent 10,000 soldiers here.

683
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,122
(Commander of Luocheng, Liu Wenxiang)
There are only 3,000 soldiers

684
00:33:17,123 --> 00:33:18,160
(Commander of Luocheng, Liu Wenxiang)
in this city.

685
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,920
(Governor of Luocheng, Fei Sheng)
Even if we tried our best,

686
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
it'd be hard to defeat them.

687
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:24,520
The Empyrean Token is lost.

688
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,560
The lords of Six States
are eager to take the throne.

689
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:29,319
I knew this day would come.

690
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:30,760
I just didn't think

691
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,760
it'd come so soon.

692
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,479
We can neither escape

693
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,280
nor surrender.

694
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,439
I've dispatched men to the Imperial City.

695
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,319
We must endure as best as we can

696
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:53,160
until reinforcements
from the Imperial City arrive.

697
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,920
What reinforcements can they offer?

698
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,520
General Dong Shufang only
has 20,000 imperial guards.

699
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
They will never come to Luocheng.

700
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,959
Even if we must die,

701
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,839
we must defend this place.

702
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,920
If we didn't, history would remember us

703
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,919
as officers who ran away
to save our own necks.

704
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,320
Sir, someone wants to see you.

705
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,479
Another big shot from the city

706
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,159
wants me to open the gate?

707
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,520
Tell them

708
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,959
I will release the people of this city,

709
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,320
but the big shots

710
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,120
are staying here with me.

711
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,439
Sir,

712
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:28,600
he says he's from the Imperial City.

713
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:31,000
They sent someone from the Imperial City?

714
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,840
Let him in.

715
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,679
Yes.

716
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:38,945
(The Empyrean Yu Family, Yu Wuyuan)

717
00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:41,040
(The Empyrean Yu Family, Yu Wuyuan)
Greetings, Governor Fei and General Liu.

718
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,199
How many soldiers have you brought?

719
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,520
I came alone.

720
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:46,679
You're not from the Imperial City.

721
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,679
Who are you?

722
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,320
I am Yu Wuyuan.

723
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,439
The maverick who roams the world alone,

724
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,320
adored by the world
but finds love in none.

725
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,959
You're the Finest Gentry.

726
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,280
What brings you here?

727
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,000
Luocheng is doomed to fall.

728
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,840
If a battle breaks out,

729
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,520
both sides will suffer heavy losses.

730
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,679
I hope to persuade

731
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,639
the Lord of Shangzhou
to withdraw his troops.

732
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,399
Are you going alone?

733
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,679
I'm meeting them for negotiation,

734
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,199
not to fight them.

735
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,560
One man

736
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,159
is enough.

737
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:23,520
Your Highness,

738
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,399
Yingzhou's body has been
sent to the capital of our state.

739
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,120
I know.

740
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,280
Warriors surrounded
the Tianshuang Sect,

741
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,719
but Bai Fengxi never showed up.

742
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,840
Are you worried she took off
with the Empyrean Token?

743
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,560
Don't you think so?

744
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,800
She protected Yingzhou
when he was in danger.

745
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,639
Yingzhou was willing to
entrust the token to her.

746
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,040
Yingzhou trusted her,

747
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,000
so I trust her.

748
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
If she had taken off with the token,

749
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,120
she would have failed Yingzhou.

750
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:56,879
I'd make her pay.

751
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,879
Understood.

752
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,879
Mr. Wuyuan went to Luocheng.

753
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,159
He tries to stop another war.

754
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,879
As the finest gentry,

755
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,280
when will he understand

756
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,639
that war will never end

757
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,280
unless

758
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,120
the country is unified?

759
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,760
Let's go.

760
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:18,959
The Tianshuang Sect

761
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,080
is just over this mountain.

762
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,000
Well?

763
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,159
How is my cooking?

764
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,520
It smells great.

765
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:32,040
Make the fire bigger.

766
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,760
Han Pu, put some effort into it

767
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,159
or you'll only get the fish bones.

768
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:53,639
Han Pu.

769
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,639
I didn't mean it.

770
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,439
But...

771
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,080
I didn't mean it!

772
00:36:58,439 --> 00:36:59,080
Stop right there!

773
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,399
Who's there?

774
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,040
I'll let go. Sheathe your sword.

775
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,560
Or maybe

776
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,199
I should break it.

777
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,040
Sheathe the sword.

778
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:26,199
Miss, could you let go?

779
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:27,399
What if I didn't?

780
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,959
What do you want?

781
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,479
Apologize.

782
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:32,919
Apologize?

783
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,560
The child wasn't hurt.

784
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,040
You won't apologize

785
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,520
just because the child

786
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,560
wasn't killed or hurt,

787
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:40,840
will you?

788
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:42,320
Very well.

789
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,919
I've killed plenty of people.

790
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,520
However, I've never
taken any innocent lives.

791
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:47,919
But today,

792
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,560
I'll know what it's like to take one.

793
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,800
Feng, are you all right?

794
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:34,919
I'm all right.

795
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:38,919
I haven't met an opponent
as mighty as you for some time.

796
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:39,879
Sir...

797
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,959
Do not blame yourself.

798
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:44,080
Only a handful of people

799
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:46,239
can match her skill in martial art world.

800
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,679
I couldn't defeat her either.

801
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,800
I've never met anyone
who can match Black Foxy's

802
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,320
handsome look and grace.

803
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:55,560
Feng, did you say something?

804
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,360
I was talking about you.

805
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,399
Stop being so childish.

806
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,199
Miss, you are a skilled fighter.

807
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,479
May I know your name?

808
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,040
She doesn't just tell strangers

809
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,639
her name so easily.

810
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:11,040
You should at least
apologize to me first.

811
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Young boy,

812
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:13,679
I should at least know

813
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,879
who I am apologizing to.

814
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
My name is Han Pu.

815
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,800
I'm going to surpass

816
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,120
the Bai-Hei Fengxi one day.

817
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,639
Why are you laughing?

818
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,080
This lady here is...

819
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,239
You've embarrassed yourself.

820
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,360
Don't embarrass me too.

821
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,239
Silence.

822
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,239
The young have potential.

823
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,520
How can you be so sure he won't

824
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,560
surpass both of them?

825
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:35,639
Miss Han,

826
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:38,360
I wasn't mocking him.

827
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,959
I applaud his will

828
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:42,800
despite his young age.

829
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:44,439
He will achieve greatness one day.

830
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,520
The Bai-Hei Fengxi

831
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,679
have dominated for decades.

832
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,320
It takes more than fancy words

833
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,919
to surpass them.

834
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,360
She is not...

835
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,719
Silence.

836
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,760
Those two will grow old eventually.

837
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,320
They will be too old to fight.

838
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,719
Someone will take their places.

839
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,600
Since we can't defeat them,

840
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:04,760
let's leave.

841
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:05,879
Sure.

842
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:06,800
Wait.

843
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:07,800
What now?

844
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,560
Do you want another fight?

845
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,080
I'll have a hard time
fighting your master.

846
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,439
But you?

847
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,800
I can easily beat you.

848
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,199
I, Xiao Xuekong, do not
kill innocent lives.

849
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:18,600
Sorry.

850
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,159
Xiao Xuekong?

851
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:23,159
Understood.

852
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,280
Why are you

853
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,159
and your little brother

854
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,760
all the way on this mountain?

855
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:31,840
I don't think people such as

856
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,120
you two should be

857
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,679
on this mountain.

858
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,120
You are the second person

859
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,719
I have no absolute confidence to defeat.

860
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,800
Why is it that I have never

861
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,760
heard of your name?

862
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:46,080
The second person?

863
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,199
Who is the first?

864
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:50,040
Yu Wuyuan.

865
00:40:57,076 --> 00:40:58,021
(Luocheng)

866
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:10,639
Please tell your commander

867
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:11,520
that I hope

868
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,479
to see him in person.

869
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:14,479
What now?

870
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,280
Are there no warriors among you?

871
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,320
You sent me a frail scholar?

872
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,320
Young man,

873
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,560
turn back immediately.

874
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:25,280
I'm here to negotiate for peace.

875
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:27,840
I don't want to negotiate.

876
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
I want you to surrender!

877
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,154
(Luocheng)

878
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,600
It seems it's not up to you to decide.

879
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,040
Tell the commanding officer.

880
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:35,879
You want to see him in person?

881
00:41:36,399 --> 00:41:37,000
Very well.

882
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,199
I'll take your head to him right away!
