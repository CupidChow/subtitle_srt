20
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,120
Lanxi, are you trying
to come clean to Father now?

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,199
If Father knows

22
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,239
you're the owner of Fountain Abode,

23
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,639
will he still care that you're his son?

24
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,760
You don't have any proof.

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,400
Why should I turn myself in?

26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,080
You're just trying to give me a scare.

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,919
Haven't you received the news

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
that people in House of Jade
will be executed soon?

29
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:08,479
Unless

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,279
you don't care about them?

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,919
Oh, right.

32
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,679
You look all virtuous from the surface

33
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,919
but deep down,
you couldn't care less about others.

34
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,839
I wonder how despair

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,919
your followers will feel.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,279
Father gave you three days

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,839
(Room of Serenity)
to identify the owner of Fountain Abode.

38
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:29,880
I will give him three days too.

39
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,479
In your opinion,

40
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,800
between the power Fountain Abode holds

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,240
and the life of Yongzhou's Third Prince,

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,800
which one does he cherish more?

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,479
Are you going to kill me?

44
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,360
No.

45
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,000
I won't do anything to you.

46
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,039
I just want to see

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,240
how Father will make
his decision in the end.

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,600
Have you ever thought about
the consequences of your action?

49
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,759
You're declaring war against Yongzhou.

50
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,080
I guess Fountain Abode

51
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,240
will no longer be able

52
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,000
to maintain its foothold in
the martial arts world after that.

53
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,800
It was established because of me.

54
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:10,639
I can choose to abandon it.

55
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,240
Even without that identity,

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,800
I can still enjoy my life

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,720
as the Second Prince of Yongzhou.

58
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:48,960
Run!

59
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:51,360
(Room of Serenity)
Are you forcing Father to make a decision

60
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:53,080
because

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,279
you always hate me?

62
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,440
Were you jealous that
he favored me more than you?

63
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,279
I hope Father favors you

64
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
more than he favors power.

65
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,919
This way,

66
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,360
I can save the people
of the House of Jade.

67
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,079
Actually, I always knew

68
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,200
that your men were
working in my residence.

69
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,399
That's why
I divulge the information on purpose.

70
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,200
Fountain Abode
doesn't have many weak points.

71
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,239
I can't find anything useful
to use against you.

72
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,600
That's why I can only depend on Father

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,359
as he wages war against you.

74
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,320
Initially,
I have great expectations of you.

75
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,079
However, now,

76
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,640
I think you're too soft-hearted.

77
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,640
That's why this time,

78
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,399
I'll side with Father.

79
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,839
That's why I'm dragging you into this.

80
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,320
You're one of my bargaining chips.

81
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:51,959
Lanxi,

82
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,959
stop pretending to be ignorant.

83
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,480
The people who are trying
to rescue the prisoners

84
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,079
will never win against the Royal Army.

85
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,959
Wait, didn't you
hear about the jailbreak?

86
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,480
Don't move!

87
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,279
You guys should surrender immediately.

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,160
Send them to the dungeon.

89
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,119
Take them away.

90
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,160
Yes, Sir!

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,799
This morning, I received news

92
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,480
that someone would attempt a jailbreak.

93
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,600
That's why I was daring enough
to get on your carriage.

94
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,679
So you had no idea?

95
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,679
First, the House of Jade.

96
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,200
Now, the Tianshuang Sect?

97
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:03,880
Lanxi,

98
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,200
it seems like

99
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,720
you're finally going to lose this time.

100
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,897
(Room of Serenity)

101
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,760
(Since it all started because of me,)

102
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,799
(I should be the one who ends it.)

103
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,920
(I have run out of choices.)

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,920
(I will sacrifice myself)

105
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,359
(to save everyone else.)

106
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:35,119
Traitorous son!

107
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,399
He actually delivered
a memorial to me himself,

108
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,239
telling me

109
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,640
that he's Hei Fengxi!

110
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,399
And, the dates and statements
match all the records!

111
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:43,480
Your Lordship,

112
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,839
in my opinion,

113
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,559
I think Prince Lanxi

114
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,839
did so because of bitter reasons.

115
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,000
You don't need to speak up for him!

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,480
This son of mine,

117
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,760
this traitorous son of mine,

118
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,880
he did surprise me indeed.

119
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,399
Hei Fengxi? Feng Lanxi?

120
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,119
I should've figured it out long ago.

121
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,079
He's exceptional

122
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:11,679
and crafty.

123
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:12,902
(Memorial by Prince Yongping,
Feng Lanxi)

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,720
(Royal Study)

125
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,519
Your Lordship, in my opinion,

126
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,679
I think Prince Yongping is here
to apologize to you with sincerity.

127
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,799
You're speaking up for him.

128
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,000
Could it be that you're a member

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,760
of Fountain Abode as well?

130
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,479
Your Lordship!

131
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,159
I've always been loyal to you!

132
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,599
No matter if he has the intention
to usurp the throne or not,

133
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,760
it no longer matters now.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,679
Go.

135
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,719
Tell him to go back.

136
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,479
Regarding this matter,

137
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,640
I will make the decision myself.

138
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,880
Yes, Your Lordship.

139
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:15,598
(Royal Study)

140
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:25,840
Father!

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,272
(Royal Study)

142
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,799
Your Highness, His Lordship said

143
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,039
that he would make the decision himself.

144
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,520
Your Highness, you should return first.

145
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,239
Father! Since I'm confessing
my crime today,

146
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
that means I no longer
have anything to worry about.

147
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,960
Even if you want to take my life,

148
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,440
I have no regrets about it!

149
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:58,022
(Royal Study)

150
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,000
Since you want to clarify yourself,

151
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,280
I will give you a chance.

152
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,599
Royal Guards!

153
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,840
You and I are but tens of steps away.

154
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,159
However, I do not know how many secrets

155
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,799
you're hiding from me.

156
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,320
If you wish to tell me about them,

157
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,400
you may walk over here.

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,520
Thank you, Father.

159
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,119
In front of you guys

160
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
isn't Prince Yongping of Yongzhou.

161
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:13,119
He's the respectable Hei Fengxi
who has shaken up the martial arts world.

162
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,040
You guys shouldn't
belittle a hero like him.

163
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,840
Your Highness, please return!

164
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,599
I beg you, please return!

165
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,039
Someone once told me

166
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,239
that I must never give up

167
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,840
no matter what obstacles I face.

168
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:50,880
I, Feng Lanxi,

169
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,840
would like to request
an audience with you, Father.

170
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,719
You may come in.

171
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,520
Your Highness!

172
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,119
Your Highness!

173
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,559
Your Highness!

174
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,599
Greetings,

175
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,200
Father.

176
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:52,599
Long live Father.

177
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:58,239
So, is the person in front of me

178
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,000
Prince Yongping, Feng Lanxi?

179
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,239
Or is he Hei Fengxi from Fountain Abode?

180
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,320
I cannot be sure

181
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,640
about the intention you're hiding

182
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,280
about the intention you're hiding

183
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,280
under your appearance.

184
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,799
I cannot see through you.

185
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:17,960
Tell me.

186
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,280
Why did you establish Fountain Abode?

187
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,679
Initially, I did it to protect myself.

188
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,280
After that,

189
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,679
I did it to protect more people.

190
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,760
To protect more people?

191
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,599
I guess this reason is dignified enough.

192
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:35,919
This is but an excuse!

193
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,559
Ask yourself this question!

194
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,679
Could you even trust your own excuse?

195
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,640
What I have said

196
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,239
is fair and true.

197
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,280
In order to protect myself,

198
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,719
I had no choice

199
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
but to feign sickness,

200
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,200
practice martial arts in secret,

201
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,159
and establish Fountain Abode.

202
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,760
After that,

203
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,520
I made great contributions
to the martial arts world.

204
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,080
That's how Fountain Abode

205
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,239
was able to grow stronger day by day.

206
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,000
I was thinking

207
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,280
that I could use the organization
to protect more people

208
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,000
and use the profits I had made

209
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,040
for our people

210
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,000
so that I could bless the world
with your grace, Father.

211
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,400
If that's the case,

212
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,839
does that mean I have to thank you?

213
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:22,439
Do I have to thank you
for deceiving everyone,

214
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,319
colluding with other officials,
creating your own faction,

215
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,479
and attempting to stage a rebellion?

216
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,400
Or do I have to thank you

217
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,400
for showing me and your brothers mercy?

218
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,839
Father, I just wanted

219
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:41,520
to explain myself to you.

220
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,079
Explain yourself to me?

221
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,000
You will never be able
to explain yourself!

222
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,079
Do you think
you still can explain yourself

223
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,719
ever since you started
hiding things from me?

224
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
Do you know

225
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,479
that ever since what you'd done
was revealed to the world,

226
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,599
no matter if you have the intention
to stage a rebellion or not,

227
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,959
to the people, you're a traitor!

228
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,199
It doesn't matter

229
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,800
whether I believe in you

230
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:06,040
or whether you
have committed those deeds.

231
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,560
I know that.

232
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,119
I came here today

233
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,839
so that you can give the people

234
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,479
an explanation, Father.

235
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,827
(Memorial by Prince Yongping,
Feng Lanxi)

236
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,000
This is the list of branches

237
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,079
Fountain Abode has in all regions

238
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,680
and the business accounts of the
House of Jade for the past few years.

239
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,280
Father, please take a look.

240
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,959
What do you mean by this?

241
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,479
Fountain Abode

242
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,760
was originally established
under your order.

243
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,199
I was just sharing your burden
with you, Father.

244
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,520
Wasn't this what you wanted all along?

245
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,319
Someone!

246
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,680
Bring it here.

247
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:23,640
Fountain Abode is not
the only thing I want.

248
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,359
I also understand

249
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,199
that Fountain Abode
will cease to function

250
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,599
without Hei Fengxi.

251
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,760
If so, why would I take over
a piece of junk like that?

252
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,239
This liquor is called Grief.

253
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,199
It is not poison.

254
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,199
However,
it will dispel your inner force.

255
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,920
You always showed people
that you were weak and studious, right?

256
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,000
If so, you should be
true to them for once.

257
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,479
I...

258
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,599
I only have one question.

259
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,119
Father, since when did you

260
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,880
prepare this for me?

261
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,319
I prepared it ever since I found out
you were Hei Fengxi.

finds you in such a state
when he wakes up,

310

he'll be heartbroken.

311
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,920
Just let me stay by his side.

312
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:15,599
All right.

313

Black Foxy,

314
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,319
won't you please talk to me?

315
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,920
Fine, I'll talk to you.

316
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,239
You know this too.

317
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,959
I hate it when you're

318
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:43,599
all emotionless like this.

319
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,959
It makes me feel distant from you.

320
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,880
That's why

321
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,119
you should wake up as soon as possible.

322
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,479
You should open your eyes
and look at me.

323
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,920
I would rather you scold me

324
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,119
than for you to remain in this state.

325
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,760
You're pretty confident, aren't you?

326
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,280
However,

327
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,880
you do have plenty of flaws too.

328
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,520
You have a huge temper. You're prideful.

329
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,880
And you don't get along well
with other people.

330
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:20,439
In conclusion,

331
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,920
you're a cunning old fox.

332
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,400

your flaws.

337

you were by my side, stupid fox.

338
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:58,400
Didn't you say you have
plenty of words to tell me?

339
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,239
I will be furious

But it's useless even if you tell me.

The palace has sent us an edict.

400
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,599
Your Highness,
you are to head to Youzhou immediately.

401
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,479
I shall take my leave first.

402
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,560
Regarding the marriage proposal
in Youzhou...

403
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,359
I understand.

404
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,680
You have no choice but to join it

405
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:35,040
so that you can protect
Master and the rest.

406
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,119
I also know

407
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,280
that you don't join it
of your own accord.

408
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,280
I'll follow you to Youzhou.

409
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:49,719
Since it has come to this,

410
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,640
I will protect you

411
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,359
and keep you company.

412
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,680

413
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,760

Sir, thank you for escorting me.

417
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,160
I will surely repay the favor one day.

418

It's fine.

419
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,079
Since we've already arrived at Youzhou,

420
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,119
you are free to go, Miss.

421
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:53,839
It's her, right?

422
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,400
I thought you knew it was her long ago?

423
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:58,359
If so, what did you think
about my acting?

424
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,439
You didn't try to please her on purpose.

425
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,000
Yet you showed her
the right amount of flair.

426
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:06,239
At least her impression of you
won't be terrible.

427
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,800
If that's the case,

428
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:10,079
I guess I'm closer to winning now.

429
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,959
Your Highness,
please take a break for now.

430
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,520
I'll inquire about
how the others are doing.

431
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,920
Thank you for your effort.

432
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:29,680
Sir,

433
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:31,560
we received news
from the capital of Yongzhou.

434
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,479
Lord of Yongzhou has already
regained control of Fountain Abode.

435
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,920
Rumor has it that Feng Lanxi
was seriously injured

436
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
and that he has lost all of his powers.

437
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,880
He did sacrifice a lot
in order to survive, didn't he?

438
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,119
Initially, I wanted
to use this opportunity

439
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,319
to make them turn against each other.

440
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,079
With Feng Lanxi's temper,

441
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,359
it could stir up
civil unrest in Yongzhou.

442
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,119
In the end, who would've thought

443
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:49,800
he was actually willing to sacrifice

444
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,119
Fountain Abode and his powers for this?

445
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,880
But it doesn't matter now.

446
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,199
Now that I've broken one of his wings,

447
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,839
I assume it's difficult for him
to become the heir of Lord of Yongzhou.

448
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,000
And,

449
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:02,000
this time, he's representing

450
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,119
Yongzhou for the marriage proposal.

451
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,400
We must use this opportunity

452
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,560
to kill him in Youzhou.

453
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,239
The murder of the prince of Yongzhou
in Youzhou?

454
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,880
That would be interesting.

455
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,359
I will arrange for that immediately.

456
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:26,680
Fools!

457
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,000
Fools!

458
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,920
A bunch of useless fools!

459
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,359
Why did I raise

460
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,880
a bunch of useless fools like you guys?

461
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:37,839
If something does happen to Chunran,

462
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:38,800
all of you

463
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,199
will be beheaded immediately!

464
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,160
I will send my men to
search for Princess Chunran again.

465
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,160
All of you, scram!

466
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:52,760
Father,

467
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,000
now that the princes

468
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,920
and heroes from all states

469
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,040
have already gathered here,

470
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,959
if we still can't locate Chunran,

471
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:01,560
I'm sure something huge will happen.

472
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,040
In my opinion,
we should prepare for the worst.

473
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,479
On one hand,
we should hasten the search for Chunran.

474
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:07,280
On the other hand,

475
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,399
I suggest replacing Chunran
with Chunning.

476
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:12,000
Although Chunning
isn't as beautiful as...

477
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,439
Chunyuan,

478
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,760
so,

479
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,879
you're going this far
for the sake of your younger sister?

480
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,360
Do you only think

481
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:25,760
that Chunning is
your only younger sister?

482
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,840
Don't you want Chunran to come back?

483
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,840
Father! That was never my intention!

484
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,679
I'm just afraid
the princes and gentries of all states

485
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,360
might be upset with
the current situation

486
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,080
and turn against Youzhou instead!

487
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm doing this for the sake of Youzhou!

488
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,919
Father, the heaven and earth
are my witnesses!

489
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,879
- You!
- Your Lordship!

490
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,840
Your Lordship,
Princess Chunran has returned.

491

Yes, Your Lordship!

493
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,600
Get up!

494
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,600

00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,280
Hurry and get up!

497
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,600
Chun, were you hurt anywhere?

498
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:05,239
Father, I'm fine.

499
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:07,120
But I've made you worried
for the past few days.

500
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,439
Please punish me!

501
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,120
What crime have you committed?

502
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,840
Chunyuan, hurry
and order the Royal Kitchen

503
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:14,879
to prepare some delicacies for her!

504
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,919
Yes, Father.

505
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,639
Chun, tell me.

506
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,040
Tell me what happened on your way here.

507
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,879
Father, what should we do now?

508
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,320
Don't worry.

509
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,600
Bai Fengxi and Prince Yongping

510
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,560
will surely come and rescue us.

511
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,399
But now, Prince Yongping
can't even fend for himself.

512
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:40,639
Lord of Yongzhou captured us

513
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,679
in order to threaten Prince Yongping.

514
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,360
At least we're safe for now.

515
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,679
Initially, we were here
to save the people,

516
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:46,959
but we fell into a trap.

517
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,120
Now, we've implicated
Prince Yongping instead.

518
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,679
Time to eat.

519
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,120
Come, your food is here.

520
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:55,159
Come and take your food.

521
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,239
Okay.

522
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,280
Where did you get this jade pendant?

523
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,399
Can I have a look?

524
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,159
Have you seen this jade pendant before?

525
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,479
Yes, I have.

526
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:52,719
I was the one
who created this jade pendant.

527
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,080
I was once Dadong's
number one jade carver.

528
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,800
After that, Lord of Yongzhou
invited me here

529
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:01,520
to carve a huge Buddha statue.

530
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,639
After I was done,

531
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,080
he locked me up in here.

532
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,639
What's your relationship
with the Yu family?

533
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,120
The Yu family?

534
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,120
The Yu family

535
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,879
of the Imperial City

536
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:16,280
requested me
to make this jade pendant long ago.

537
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,120
However, the people of
the Empyrean Yu family

538
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,159
all have short lives.

539
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,399
I don't know

540
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:23,239
if they're still alive by now.

541
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,879
Mister, are you sure about this?

542
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,000
Naturally.

543
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,520
I am the only person

544
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,159
who knows how to do such engravings.

545
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,239
(The Yu family of the Imperial City)

546
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,520
(and the Empyrean Yu family?)

547
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,719
(Could it be him?)
