Fortunately, Miss Huan
was attentive enough

21
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,080
to notice that something was missing
from Your Highness's fox fur coat.

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,160
Otherwise,

23
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:48,599
they would have found out.

24
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,080
Good thing Minister Feng

25
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,239
prepared a used fox fur coat.

26
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,599
We won't be able to clear our name
if it wasn't for her.

27
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,519
I don't understand why Queen Baili

28
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,199
would go as far as to

29
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:03,120
kill Miss Qi Cheng just to frame you.

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,040
She has always wanted Feng Chang

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
to fight against me.

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,760
I don't think this is her plan at all.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,440
I'm afraid

34
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,639
this is Feng Ju's doing.

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,639
Your Highness, now that Prince Chang
is still unconscious,

36
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,639
you cannot completely get away.

37
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,039
If Prince Chang wakes up,

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,199
then...

39
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,039
I'll

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,600
deal with him.

41
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,919
Why are you here?

42
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,199
I heard you were imprisoned

43
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,679
so I came to visit you.

44
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:21,600
Are you

45
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,919
worried about me?

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,440
Why would I be?

47
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,119
You don't need nor want

48
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,479
to resort to hurting your own family.

49
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,000
Also,

50
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,320
you weren't arrested.

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,639
You're just confined to this place.

52
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,360
That means you already have a solution.

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,039
You already knew?

54
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,119
Not just me,

55
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,479
everyone in the capital of Yongzhou knows.

56
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,559
There are all sorts of rumors.

57
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:49,199
A feud between brothers for the throne

58
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,600
is now the dinner-party material.

59
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,440
The royal family
is now a laughing stock.

60
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,360
My father must be infuriated now.

61
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,520
If you don't mind,

62
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,279
why don't you tell me

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,279
everything?

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,279
That was what happened.

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,600
Thank god I'm always cautious

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,679
so I came prepared.

67
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,199
Otherwise,

68
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,360
I would be incarcerated now.

69
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,440
You know very well

70
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,040
that was a trap set by your brother.

71
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,160
Why did you step right into it?

72
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,920
I get it.

73
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,880
You're doing this for Feng Chang.

74
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:38,799
You told me

75
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,160
that he was forced.

76
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,320
If you did not take the bait,

77
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,119
he would be coerced
into doing this again.

78
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,519
To save him,

79
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,000
you have to take this risk

80
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,880
and figure out a solution on the way.

81
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,519
I just didn't expect

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
they would go as far

83
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,640
as to cripple Feng Chang

84
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,600
and kill Miss Qi Cheng.

85
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,079
I fancy myself an intelligent man

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,959
but I cannot predict everything.

87
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,239
That's why I never like

88
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,239
to chase after dominion.

89
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,000
For their selfish desire, humans

90
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:23,040
are willing to destroy
their own families.

91
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,600
However,

92
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:29,640
although you look aloof and distant,

93
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,239
you show a different side

94
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,559
when you're with the ones close to you.

95
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,880
All in all,

96
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,920
you're a decent person.

97
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,359
How do you know I'm different

98
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,559
with people close to me?

99
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,839
Because I have seen it myself.

100
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,200
All right.

101
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,440
Anyway.

102
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,200
I know you're doing this
for your brother

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,399
but your strategy is lackluster.

104
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:02,519
You should talk to him,

105
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,239
reconcile with him,

106
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,320
and join hands against common enemies.

107
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,440
You

108
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,440
always hide your feelings.

109
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,399
You don't communicate.

110
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,160
And if you don't,

111
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,760
no one will know what you're thinking.

112
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,239
Did you

113
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,320
get my feelings then?

114
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,119
I...

115
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:37,959
I'm busy.

116
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,359
Bye.

117
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,760
(Graceful, Compassion, Cultured)

118
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,920
Dismissed now.

119
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,079
His Highness' pulse is all normal.

120
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,559
Your Highness.

121
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,760
Your Highness.

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,799
You should...

123
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:34,880
Your Highness.

124
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,679
How is my leg?

125
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,640
You fractured your tibia.

126
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,239
With enough rest,

127
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,880
your motor skill will recover.

128
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,480
No,

129
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,000
tell everyone in the royal palace

130
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,880
that my leg sustained a heavy injury

131
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,359
and I'll have to use a crutch forever.

132
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,760
-Your Highness...
-Add

133
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,000
that I'm still unconscious

134
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,239
and it'll take several days
before I wake up.

135
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,040
There are blood clots in my brain

136
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,679
and when I wake up,

137
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,160
I might have amnesia.

138
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,880
Your Highness,

139
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,799
falsifying a medical report
is a serious offense.

140
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
I dare not lie to His Lordship.

141
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,839
If you can't cure me,

142
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,720
my father will only reproach you
for your incompetence.

143
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,399
If you do not obey me...

144
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,640
Your son just earned the title
of a scholar, didn't he?

145
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,119
As you wish, Your Highness.

146
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,519
Go out now

147
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,440
and tell those guards sent by my father

148
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,559
that I need to rest in tranquility.

149
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,080
Tell them to stay in the front yard.

150
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:42,320
Do not move without my order.

151
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,880
Yes, Your Highness.

152
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,599
I'll take my leave now.

153
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,559
Your Highness,

154
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,559
should I summon Physician Zheng,
the Administrative Assistant,

155
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,799
to administer acupuncture
to quell your pain?

156
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,039
The more painful it is,

157
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:07,080
the less guilty I feel against Lanxi.

158
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,080
When I saw Miss Qi Cheng's body,

159
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,359
I regretted my decision.

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,760
Your Highness,

161
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,599
you don't deserve this.

162
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,159
It's better this way.

163
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Only when I become a useless cripple

164
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:36,640
that she will stop using me as a pawn.

165
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,039
Otherwise,

166
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:42,400
she'll continue forcing me
to get rid of Lanxi,

167
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:45,119
to get rid of all who are in her way.

168
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,440
Bring me some wine.

169
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,679
Your Highness,

170
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,760
you shouldn't imbibe.

171
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,119
Any news about Feng Chang?

172
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,119
Prince Chang is still unconscious.

173
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,719
His Lordship has arranged for physicians
to look after him in shifts.

174
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,000
I have also planted my people
in his residence.

175
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,799
As soon as he wakes up,

176
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,280
I'll ask him to proceed with the plan

177
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,159
and frame Prince Yongping.

178
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,239
Will he truly do it?

179
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,960
Your Highness, are you saying

180
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,280
that Prince Chang does not want
to frame Prince Yongping?

181
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,960
Then...

182
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,400
If Prince Chang went mad...

183
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:37,719
Mad?

184
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,400
When he wakes up, he might or might not

185
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,880
frame Prince Yongping.

186
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:44,880
But if he goes insane,

187
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:48,280
we will definitely be able to pin this
against Prince Yongping.

188
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,400
He takes medicine every day, doesn't he?

189
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:55,840
Poisoning his broth shouldn't be
too difficult.

190
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,960
Get it done.

191
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,719
Say

192
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,679
it is Prince Yongping's order.

193
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,599
Noted.

194
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:08,473
(Feng Chang's Residence, Yongzhou)

195
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:30,159
Greetings, Prince Yongping.

196
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,159
Your Highness, you're still
under house arrest.

197
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,479
I miss my brother.

198
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,239
I wish to visit him.

199
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,039
When did the physician
say he would wake up?

200
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,400
What a shame that everything

201
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,919
has finally come to this.

202
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:16,400
Feng Chang,

203
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,400
I know you were forced

204
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,039
to frame me.

205
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,880
I attended the plum blossom festival

206
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,799
to stop them from coercing you.

207
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,080
Like I always said,

208
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:33,239
you are my brother.

209
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,919
And even now,

210
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,520
this still holds true.

211
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,960
Someone told me

212
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,159
to tell you my feelings in person.

213
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,559
I

214
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,960
do not know where to start.

215
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,320
But now that you're unconscious,

216
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,320
it somehow gave me the courage.

217
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,239
Truth be told,

218
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,280
after my mother passed away,

219
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:10,320
you're the only relative

220
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,119
I have left in this world.

221
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,880
Prince Chang

222
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,679
thinks the same too.

223
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,479
I know.

224
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,440
To clear my name,

225
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,880
Feng Chang was even ready

226
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,479
to sacrifice his life.

227
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,640
I have many regrets.

228
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,919
I want to tell him so many things

229
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,239
but I have missed the opportunity.

230
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,000
I believe my mother will protect us.

231
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:45,080
She definitely doesn't want us

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,200
to live with regrets.

233
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,520
Prince Yongping,

234
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,239
I'm sure Prince Chang will find solace

235
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,280
in your words.

236
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,400
Give me the medicine.

237
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:08,840
All right.

238
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:38,039
Why is it poisonous?

239
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,000
Where is the prescription?

240
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,760
Here.

241
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,919
The prescription is fine

242
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,799
but this broth has been poisoned.

243
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,440
Someone wishes to harm Prince Chang.

244
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,320
Uncle De,

245
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,200
who brewed this for Feng Chang?

246
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,280
A new maid in this residence.

247
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,239
I have run a background check.

248
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,200
She

249
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,039
is Queen Baili's person.

250
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,719
Prepare another broth.

251
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,000
When Feng Chang is awake,

252
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
don't tell him I visited.

253
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:29,919
Don't tell him about the maid as well.

254
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,320
I'll deal with it.

255
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,640
Just let him recuperate.

256
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,840
Noted.

257
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,520
Your Highness.

258
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,359
From now on,

259
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:57,200
you're the only family

260
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,320
I have in this world.

261
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,200
He's awake?

262
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,880
Head to Prince Yongxin's Residence
immediately.

263
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,400
Yes, Your Lordship.

264
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,559
Didn't I tell you to poison him?

265
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,880
For some reason,

266
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,440
Prince Chang's housekeeper found out
that the broth was poisoned.

267
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,119
Our people

268
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,960
couldn't find
another window of opportunity.

269
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,440
Go to Prince Yongxin's Residence.

270
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,520
Make sure Feng Lanxi
is being watched closely.

271
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,159
Yes, Your Highness.

272
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,960
Our people are among the guards

273
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,000
dispatched to Prince Yongxin's
Residence.

274
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,479
Make sure they pay extra attention
to Prince Chang.

275
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,880
If any harm comes to Prince Yongping,

276
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,840
inform us right away.

277
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:37,840
Yes.

278
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,840
Also,

279
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,000
make sure Official Zhang

280
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,320
is aware of the evidence
as soon as possible.

281
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,039
Do not dally.

282
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,440
Yes.

283
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,000
Go now.

284
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,599
Prince Chang just woke up.

285
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,000
He could use something to calm his mind.

286
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,960
Her Highness asked me

287
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,039
to deliver this soothing broth
that she brewed.

288
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,679
Prince Chang is still unwell.

289
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,760
He lacks the appetite.

290
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,320
I'll serve it to him later.

291
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,599
It's best served warm.

292
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,400
Try it, Your Highness.

293
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,239
His Lordship has arrived!

294
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,119
Greetings, Your Lordship.

295
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,319
Get up now.

296
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,400
Thanks, Your Lordship.

297
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,439
Greetings, Father.

298
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,199
Chang, you're awake.

299
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:39,800
Who pushed you off the second floor?

300
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:48,319
Chang?

301
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,199
Did you hear me?

302
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,800
Who tried to kill you?

303
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,439
Was it

304
00:17:57,719 --> 00:18:00,040
Feng Lanxi or Baili Jing?

305
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,040
That day,

306
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,400
someone told me that Feng Lanxi
was looking for me.

307
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:06,800
But

308
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,280
I didn't see him when I was upstairs.

309
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:12,560
And then...

310
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,719
And then...

311
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:21,880
And then...

312
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,319
Yes?

313
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:25,839
I can't

314
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,680
remember what happened next.

315
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,119
You can't?

316
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,680
Your Lordship.

317
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,040
There are blood clots
in Prince Yongxin's head.

318
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,800
He is most probably suffering amnesia.

319
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,000
You can't recall anything.

320
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,839
It's okay.

321
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,680
In that case,

322
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,520
rest well.

323
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,479
We'll speak
when you're completely healed.

324
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:54,560
Thanks, Father.

325
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,239
I'll leave then.

326
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,040
Farewell, Your Lordship.

327
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,039
(Everlasting Virtues)

328
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:04,719
Your Highness,

329
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,280
Prince Chang is awake.

330
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,719
His Lordship went to visit him.

331
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,839
Prince Chang claimed he couldn't recall
what happened in Xuliu Parlor.

332
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,599
I see.

333
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,479
Visit my mentor

334
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:26,160
and ask him to scour all intel
from Liangcheng.

335
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,839
Liangcheng?

336
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,079
Why the sudden interest, Your Highness?

337
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,439
To be the heir,

338
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,719
I need to have power.

339
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,920
To be the ruler of the world,

340
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,680
I need to have an army.

341
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,239
Within Yongzhou,

342
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,400
the best place for us to amass an army

343
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,880
is Liangcheng.

344
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,239
I see.

345
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,800
I'll go to Chancellor Ren now.

346
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,440
(Everlasting Virtues)

347
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,319
What? Amnesia?

348
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,439
Yes.

349
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,719
His Lordship quizzed him

350
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,839
but Prince Chang said
he couldn't remember a thing.

351
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,319
He would sacrifice a limb

352
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,439
to clear Feng Lanxi's name.

353
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,760
What a traitor.

354
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,839
This pawn

355
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,680
is no use anymore.

356
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,319
Do you think

357
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,280
he's telling the truth or it is an act?

358
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,560
In my humble opinion,

359
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,800
some things are best forgotten.

360
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,520
A message, Your Lordship.

361
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,760
Official Zhang Zhongge
seeks an audience.

362
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,199
Greetings, Your Lordship.

363
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,079
You may get up.

364
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,160
Thank you, Your Lordship.

365
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:34,079
Your Lordship,

366
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,040
I discovered a torn part
on the fox fur coat

367
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,680
from Baili Jing's Residence.

368
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:41,920
It carries

369
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,640
the same scent on Miss Qi Cheng's body.

370
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:50,640
Zhongge.

371
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,839
Don't you think this piece of evidence

372
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,160
came too great a timing?

373
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,079
Yes, I do.

374
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:01,839
Close the case then.

375
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,839
Tell everyone
that Feng Chang's fall was an accident.

376
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:06,280
As to Baili Jing...

377
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,000
Isn't he a madman now?

378
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:10,400
He'll be liable for the death

379
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,439
of the Qi family's daughter.

380
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,040
Yes, Your Lordship.

381
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,079
About Her Highness...

382
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:21,680
It can't be helped.

383
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,079
That's her fate.

384
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,040
Her nosy brother dug the hole himself.

385
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,880
Set all princes

386
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:30,079
free now.

387
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,520
Ask them to attend
the court meeting tomorrow morning.

388
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,479
When the ministers see them,

389
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,560
everything will be clear.

390
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,760
(Prince Yongxin's Residence)

391
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,560
Is it December 24th
on the lunar calendar today?

392
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:55,233
(Prosperous and Respected)

393
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:55,959
Yes, it is.

394
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,000
So

395
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,439
I asked the servants to clean the rooms

396
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:02,239
and change the geomantic omen
while we're at it.

397
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,760
I hope that next year

398
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,520
will be a peaceful year.

399
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,319
Lanxi will always visit

400
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,719
on this day.

401
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,040
Maybe

402
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,000
he had a slight delay on his way.

403
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:23,959
I see.

404
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,040
Let's return.

405
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,400
Okay.

406
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,280
Prince Yongping has arrived.

407
00:22:33,178 --> 00:22:37,342
(Prosperous and Respected)

408
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:50,520
Your Highness, you're here.

409
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,199
After my mother passed away,

410
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,719
I always come to visit

411
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,000
Feng Chang on the House-cleaning Day.

412
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,079
Have you forgotten this, Uncle De?

413
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,000
No,

414
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
I can't possibly forget this.

415
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,719
Feng Chang,

416
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,880
as usual then?

417
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,839
I will get the chessboard now.

418
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:10,959
Please wait here.

419
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,839
You're dismissed.

420
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:14,280
Yes, sir.

421
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,359
Leave now.

422
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:19,839
I don't want you here.

423
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,359
Feng Chang.

424
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,640
Do not call me that.

425
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,000
Our brotherhood

426
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:27,560
died in the plum garden.

427
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,439
We are sworn enemies who vie for power.

428
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,560
We cannot go back

429
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,400
to what we used to be.

430
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:39,920
Leave.

431
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,719
Don't make me chase you away.

432
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:44,640
Leave.

433
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,599
Leave!

434
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,199
Prince Lanxi!

435
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,800
-Prince Lanxi!
-Don't go after him.

436
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,252
(Prosperous and Respected)

437
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,760
I shooed him away.

438
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,119
But why,

439
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,640
Your Highness?

440
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,599
Queen Baili knows where to strike
to inflict maximum pain.

441
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,079
If Lanxi and I

442
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,079
reconcile,

443
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,560
Queen Baili will know

444
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:25,280
that

445
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,280
I'm his weakness.

446
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:29,439
When that comes,

447
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,040
I will only be a burden to him again.

448
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
This brother of mine

449
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:37,839
looks conniving

450
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,400
but he has a kind soul.

451
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,000
If he wants to be who he wants to be,

452
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,160
he cannot show that weakness.

453
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,199
This is the last thing I can do

454
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,920
for him as his brother.

455
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,760
Perhaps Prince Chang
just wants to protect you.

456
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,800
Do you know

457
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:01,640
why I play chess with Feng Chang
in his residence

458
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,920
on the House-cleaning Day every year?

459
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,488
(Prosperous and Respected)

460
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,760
Back then,

461
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,160
Lanxi was five years old.

462
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,839
It was on the House-Cleaning day too.

463
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,640
Lanxi

464
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,280
wanted to be a part of everything.

465
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:20,760
Unable to dissuade him otherwise,

466
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,839
Queen Yige

467
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,359
asked me to play chess with him.

468
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,680
Feng Chang then told me

469
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,319
that if I won,

470
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,599
Father and Mother would give me an extra

471
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,479
(Mix fruits and date cake)
red envelope.

472
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,040
I won

473
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,839
all the time.

474
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,760
And this one time, Mother told me

475
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,000
that Father and she gave everyone

476
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
the same amount of money.

477
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,719
The one I had extra

478
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,119
was from Feng Chang's own red envelope.

479
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,719
He's always like this.

480
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,040
He always sacrifices himself
to protect me.

481
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,239
I will be lying if I say I wasn't hurt

482
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,920
by what he said today.

483
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,800
Please go back.

484
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,280
I want some moment alone.

485
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,040
All right.

486
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:29,040
All sorts of dumplings!

487
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,640
Delicate snacks! Come have a look!

488
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,560
Sure.

489
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,760
All right.

490
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:00,719
Mother, I heard there is a temple event
outside of the palace.

491
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,920
I want to check it out.

492
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,199
It will be crowded

493
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:04,719
and we cannot venture out
of the palace on a whim.

494
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,839
Next time, perhaps.

495
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:08,760
All right.

496
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,959
Noted, Mother.

497
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,000
What's the matter?

498
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,280
It's New Year.

499
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,719
You shouldn't pout
during this time of year.

500
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,239
Or else, you'll have an unlucky year.

501
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,199
I see.

502
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,640
Do you like it?

503
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,239
Even though we can't attend
the temple event,

504
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,880
I asked your mentor

505
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,599
to get this for you.

506
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,040
Thanks, Mother.

507
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,119
Do you like this clay doll?

508
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,640
I'll buy one for you.

509
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,079
Vegetables!

510
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,839
Look at my fresh harvest!

511
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,680
You're frowning and brooding.

512
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,880
But this clay doll cheers you up a bit.

513
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,359
If you like,

514
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,760
I'll buy all of them.

515
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,400
You have bought many gifts for me

516
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,439
and I never return your gesture.

517
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,000
Now, it's my turn.

518
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:24,719
Mister.

519
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:26,400
Yes?

520
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,599
How much for these three clay dolls?

521
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,800
I don't sell clay dolls. I sell clay.

522
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,560
You just have to pay ten wen

523
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,520
to create your own clay doll.

524
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,119
All right.

525
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,040
It looks fun.

526
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,040
Let me try.

527
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,480
(The Touhu game)
(Regretting that the spring is too short)

528
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,839
You think I don't know how to sculpt

529
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,000
so I'm just winging it here?

530
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,239
It looks good

531
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,760
but the final product

532
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,199
is yet to be seen.

533
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,959
Better than those
who only give comments.

534
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,000
Who said I won't participate?

535
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,959

to suppress it anymore.

584
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,520
Only by getting the Sacred Jade Moon

585
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,719
that it can truly be suppressed.

in that regard.

We have made

589
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,719
what you requested.

590
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,400
With it,

591
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,800
the Sacred Jade Moon will be mine.

592
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,199
Oh.

593
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,000

594
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,839
Hei-Bai Fengxi.

595
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,959
They found out a secret.

596
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,359
The true identity of Hei Fengxi

597
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:30,599
is Prince Yongping.

598
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:33,319
Prince Yongping?

599
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,599
Fengxi.

600
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,760
Feng Lanxi.

601
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,400
I see.

602
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:42,959
Interesting.

603
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,599
What a surprising discovery.

604
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,560
Yongzhou shall be in chaos.

605
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:50,239
Disseminate

607
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:53,680
in Yongzhou.

608
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:54,920
Yes, sir.

609
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,959
Greetings, dear ancestors.

610
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,359
Please lend me your blessing

611
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:06,800
and protect the Yu family.

612
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:09,040
May we be free from the curse soon.

613
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:13,123
(Empyrean Yu Family, Yu Lelin)

614
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,319
Wuyuan,

615
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
we are the Empyrean Yu family.

616
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,639
You're the smartest of us all

617
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,600
within three generations.

618
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,760
Now that you're an adult,

619
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,560
it's time for me

620
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:26,719
to pass down my duty to you.

621
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,800
I am a descendant
of the Empyrean Yu family.

622
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:30,919
Whatever this duty is,

623
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,760
I will shoulder it.

624
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,879
In that case,

625
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,800
I shall explain
the secret of our family.

626
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,080
Have you heard of the Battle of Chongde?

627
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:44,879
Yes.

628
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,639
A century ago,

629
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,199
a foreign army invaded

630
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,080
and almost dethroned the Dadong Empire.

631
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,199
This foreign army
went by the name of Cricket.

632
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,479
The Cricket of the Locust and Cricket

633
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,239
was comprised of elite soldiers
from three families.

634
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,639
Their mission was to overthrow Dadong

635
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,120
and establish a new dynasty.

636
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,760
Since there was Cricket,

637
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,439
there was Locust too.

638
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:08,919
Locust was the leader of Cricket.

639
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:10,800
And the Yu family

640
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:12,360
was the Locust.

641
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,239
After our defeat
in the Battle of Chongde,

642
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:18,399
the Empyrean Token inflicted
the three families with a blood curse.

643
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,840
That's why our ancestors

644
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,679
never live beyond 30 years old.

645
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:24,879
I see.

646
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:27,199
So our ancestors' wish

647
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:28,800
was to overthrow Dadong

648
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,800
and to rule with the token.

649
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,120
Now that you are aware of this,

650
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,120
you need to continue our legacy.

651
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
(Overthrow Dadong.)

652
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,280
(Rule with the Empyrean Token.)

653
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,399
(That's how I can get rid of this curse.)

654
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,000
(This blood curse)

655
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,320
(forced my entire family
to be the nation's enemy.)

656
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
(There is no alternative.)

657
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,040
(I can only press on.)

658
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,399
Greetings, Mother.

659
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,040
Live long and prosper.

660
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,239
Get up.

661
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,040
Thanks, Mother.

662
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:16,840
New Year is around the corner.

663
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,159
Have you prepared the gift
for your father?

664
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,199
Of course.

665
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,360
Don't worry, Mother.

666
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:22,840
It's Father's favorite.

667
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,199
Good.

668
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:26,399
You have caused enough trouble
this year.

669
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:27,840
Seize this opportunity

670
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,399
to regain your father's favor.

671
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,320
Yes, Mother.

672
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,120
Therefore, engage yourself in politics.

673
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,159
Do something great.

674
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:37,120
Enlighten me, Mother.

675
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:38,840
Do you know why your father

676
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,360
amassed military supplies
out of a sudden?

677
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,760
I even heard that all blacksmiths
of the Ministry of Works

678
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,080
do not get a new year break.

679
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,879
Do you know why?

680
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:47,959
Yes.

681
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,639
Father is amassing military power
to be prepared.

682
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,479
Yes.

683
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,800
What do you think an army

684
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,040
and a war will cost?

685
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,600
What?

686
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,639
Money in our treasury.

687
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,360
You're in charge
of the Ministry of Revenue.

688
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,159
If you can make sure
that the pocket is always filled,

689
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,679
your father will have one less worry.

690
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,280
You will have a bigger achievement

691
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,800
than Feng Lanxi.

692
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,120
I get it, Mother.

693
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:18,520
But I'm not the Deity of Riches.

694
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,760
Where can I get more money for Father?

695
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,120
Fu Wenbo, Luan Qiya,

696
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,120
He Youde.

697
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,679
Do you know them?

698
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:30,800
I am acquainted with them,

699
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,120
indeed.

700
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:34,959
The three of them
have embezzled enough money.

701
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,719
Find a reason like corruption

702
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,320
and requisition the money they embezzled

703
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
into the national treasury.

704
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,000
That will put
your father's mind to rest.

705
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,080
I see.

706
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:50,840
I shall leave now.

707
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,040
Fu Wenbo, Luan Qiya, He Youde.

708
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:02,439
My mother knows the people

709
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:04,080
around me by heart.

710
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,239
Your Highness...

711
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:08,320
New Year is close
and it's the period for house cleaning.

712
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,560
We definitely can use some cleaning.

713
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,919
Your Highness, I have been nothing

714
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:13,679
but loyal to you.

715
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:15,959
I know it's not you.

716
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,679
I thought Wang Yuan
was the only informant

717
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,840
my mother planted around me.

718
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,000
After he died,
I thought my place would be cleaner.

719
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,639
How innocent of me.

720
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,399
Fret not, Your Highness.

721
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,080
I will identify the snitch

722
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,239
and get rid of it.

723
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:30,280
Do it properly.

724
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:31,760
Don't raise my mother's suspicion.

725
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,840
Yes, sir.

726
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,360
Your Highness, the news that Yu Wuyuan

727
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:18,719
has arrived in the capital of Yongzhou
is circulating.

728
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,239
I suppose the royal palace
must have caught wind of it by now.

729
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,760
I suppose
Yu Wuyuan intended this to happen.

730
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,120
Continue following Yu Wuyuan.

731
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:28,159
Let's see what he is up to.

732
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,840
Yes, Your Highness.

733
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,040
Coming.

734
00:39:38,087 --> 00:39:39,863
(A Serene Abode of Grace)

735
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:46,639
Who are you, Sir?

736
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:49,320
Is this the residence

737
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,520
of Mr. Yu Wuyuan?

738
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:51,560
Indeed.

739
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,399
Can I talk to him?

740
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,239
May I know who you are?

741
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,595
(Yongzhou)

742
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,360
Give me a moment.

743
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,600
Greetings, Eunuch Yuan.

744
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,959
Mr. Yu,

745
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,719
what gave my identity away?

746
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,000
Although you are in plain clothes now,

747
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:15,760
your boots bore the royal marking.

748
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Only someone at the management level
of the royal court can wear them.

749
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,919
Rumor has it

750
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:23,760
that the Lord of Yongzhou
loves ambergris.

751
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,159
And you give off the scent

752
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:27,360
of it.

753
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,840
That means you are someone
close to His Lordship.

754
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,360
And so, I hazarded a guess

755
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:35,360
that you are Eunuch Yuan.

756
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:38,840
As expected from the Finest Gentry.

757
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,639
His Lordship wishes to see you.

758
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,280
It is my pleasure.

759
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,800
Mr. Yu, your wisdom far precedes you.

760
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,600
Our meeting today
has filled me with joy.

761
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:56,080
A toast.

762
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,959
I'm but a commoner.

763
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,439
I can't possibly accept
all your compliments, Your Lordship.

764
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,360
You're too humble, Mr. Yu.

765
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,199
Huang Chao of Jizhou called you
his "One-line Tutor".

766
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,479
That already proves
your exceptional talent.

767
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,600
What does Yongzhou owe to your arrival,

768
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:15,760
Mr. Yu?

769
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,760
I travel around

770
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,120
to see if I can bring a solution

771
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:24,120
to this sundered world.

772
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:28,840
A solution to this sundered world?

773
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:32,280
Ambitious, aren't you, Mr. Yu?

774
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,760
You managed to stop a siege
from Shangzhou with one sentence.

775
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,439
That, I have heard of it.

776
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,280
It is impressive.

777
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,280
Why don't you stay here to help me?

778
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,479
With your help,

779
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,199
Yongzhou

780
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,320
can unite all other States.

781
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,080
I appreciate your offer, Your Lordship.

782
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:02,479
However, my heart extends beyond
a mere city, or a mere State.

783
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,800
I do not want to be employed
by any royal family.

784
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:06,560
I am a commoner

785
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:09,439
so I serve the commoners.

786
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:13,320
I just want to see a peaceful world.

787
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,120
And may all citizens

788
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,560
get to enjoy the serenity.

789
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,719
That's why

790
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,600
I aid Huang Chao.

791
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,120
So what do you wish

792
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:32,639
to tell me then, Mr. Yu?

793
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:35,000
Since you already broached the topic,

794
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
I do have a few suggestions.

795
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,479
Pray tell.
