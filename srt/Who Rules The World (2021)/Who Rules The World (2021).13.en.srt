Please order a retrial, Your Lordship.

00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,239
I second that!

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,000
I second that!

and will be placed under house arrest.

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,000
Your Lordship,
Prince Yongping is innocent.

28
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,039
It's...

29
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,600
It was an oversight from me
that I failed to examine the evidence,

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,919
but I

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,440
have never ever framed anyone.

32
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:21,600
Zhang Zhongge.

33
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,080
Yes, Your Lordship.

34
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,039
You will now reinterrogate
the candidates

35
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,679
and review the cheating case.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,720
Duly noted, Your Lordship.

37
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,639
I have never seen this cheat sheet.

38
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,559
I am an honest student.

39
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,360
I truly don't know

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,960
where this cheat sheet comes from.

41
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,600
You have never seen
what was written on it?

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,880
Never.

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,479
Come clean now.

44
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,160
Sir, I have been framed.

45
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:51,600
I never cheated.

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,960
Sir.

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,440
I'm telling the truth, sir!

48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,839
I didn't cheat.

49
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,960
Song Sihan,

50
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,440
you still won't admit it?

51
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,479
I'll speak!

52
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,360
Candidate Song Sihan,

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,199
this cheating scandal has taken
the government by surprise.

54
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,080
And now,

55
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,559
His Lordship will deal
with this case personally.

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,800
Please reiterate your testimony

57
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,919
to His Lordship.

58
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,080
I swear to tell only the truth.

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,399
Who gave you the exam questions?

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,800
My mentor,

61
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,479
a Senior Secretary,

62
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,000
Pei Youshuo.

63
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,800
Pei Youshuo?

64
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:45,720
I have the document on which

65
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,919
Mentor Pei wrote down
the exam questions.

66
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,360
Bring forth.

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,995
(Ways to promote peace)

68
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:01,360
This is indeed
Pei Youshuo's handwriting.

69
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,880
How exactly did he leak

70
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
the exam questions to you?

71
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,559
The night before the examination,

72
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:08,639
Mentor Pei invited several students

73
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,080
to his residence.

74
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,839
Sir, even though we are your students,

75
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,639
there are many spectacular talents
in this world.

76
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,640
If we underperform,

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,799
we will flunk the exam.

78
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,000
You're dismissed for now.

79
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,559
Follow me.

80
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,320
Look at this.

81
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,559
Sir, you're...

82
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,200
Now, all the best for your examination.

83
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,458
(Ways to promote peace)
Why didn't Pei Youshuo

84
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,839
destroy this paper,

85
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,959
thus allowing you to use it as evidence?

86
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,320
Because my mentor was worried

87
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,640
that someone would find out
about this plan

88
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,079
and so he asked me to prepare
a contingency plan.

89
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:00,880
A contingency plan?

90
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,839
He first asked me to submit

91
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,720
my answer to him.

92
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,679
And then, he'll figure out a way

93
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,519
to sell the answer sheet.

94
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,239
It will act as a decoy

95
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,200
and if Your Lordship
wants to investigate this case,

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,480
we can also free ourselves
from liability.

97
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,359
He wanted me to burn the question sheet

98
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,000
but I kept it just in case
everything goes sour

99
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,959
and I'll have something
to protect myself.

100
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:28,959
Your Lordship,

101
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,600
this is the draft we found

102
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,239
from Song Sihan's abode.

103
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,200
Its content is similar to what is found
in the Examination Hall.

104
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,279
Any other evidence?

105
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,760
Your Lordship,

106
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,920
I have sent someone

107
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,399
to question the people in
Official Pei's residence.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,760
A servant has testified

109
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,399
that Official Pei did ask
for stationery that day

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,799
and sent all servants away.

111
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,880
He was then alone with four candidates.

112
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,000
The other three students

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,559
of Official Pei claimed

114
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,200
that that day,

115
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,600
Official Pei wrote them

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,200
words of encouragement.

117
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,119
I have sent someone
to search their respective residence,

118
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,239
but I have found no such words.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
Besides, after the interrogation,

120
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,279
the maintenance staff
of the Examination Hall admitted

121
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,559
that Official Pei examined

122
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,320
every cell himself.

123
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,279
In that case,

124
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,880
incarcerate Pei Youshuo

125
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,200
and get to the bottom of this.

126
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,359
Yes, Your Lordship.

127
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,760
I got news from the Ministry of Justice.

128
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,839
One of Mentor's students,
Song Sihan,

129
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,279
said that Mentor
leaked the exam questions.

130
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,399
His Lordship has incarcerated
the Mentor.

131
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,720
His Highness will definitely
be implicated now.

132
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,079
We don't have much time.

133
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,480
Protect him at all costs.

134
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:40,799
Worst comes to worst,

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,640
I'll confess

136
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,720
that I forged the evidence.

137
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,760
No need for the hassle.

138
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:45,799
Your Highness.

139
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,799
Your Highness.

140
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,839
The Royal Guards aren't strong enough
to restrict my freedom.

141
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,320
Your Highness,

142
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,119
why didn't you let me
take the blame for you?

143
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,959
Baili and others

144
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,679
want me

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,279
to be framed.

146
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,160
If you take the blame for me,

147
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,040
they can't proceed with their plan.

148
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,119
So

149
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,600
you already knew, Your Highness?

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,440
Everything is going too well.

151
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,000
As if it was all planned beforehand.

152
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,799
Therefore, I knew very early

153
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,359
that Duke Liang is not the leaker.

154
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,880
You knew this is a trap, Your Highness,

155
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:21,359
so why did you walk into it?

156
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,119
If I didn't do that,

157
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,559
they wouldn't move on
to the next step quickly,

158
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,160
and I wouldn't be able

159
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,959
to find solid evidence against them.

160
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,119
What should we do then?

161
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,279
For Baili and others,

162
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,559
they must be thinking that their plan
has worked.

163
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,079
Their next step

164
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,079
is to erase all evidence.

165
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,760
This is when

166
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:43,200
we can find out the truth.

167
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,880
The housekeeper

168
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,440
is crucial.

169
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,200
Go and find out

170
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,239
who he

171
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:51,679
has contacted.

172
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:52,799
Noted.

173
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,079
(This is a game of cat and mouse.)

174
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,239
(Let's see who is the cat)

175
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
(and who is the mouse.)

176
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,320
Are you looking for me?

177
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,600
Miss Fengxi,

178
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,920
I'm from House of Jade.

179
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,760
Someone asked me
to give you this letter.

180
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,760
Thank you.

181
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:23,480
(To Bai Fengxi)

182
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,159
Did Father go to Mount Wu?

183
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,080
Yes.

184
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,719
He was visiting an old friend

185
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,599
when he learned

186
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,359
that Old Taiyin was looking
for a successor.

187
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,479
That's why he rushed to Mount Wu
to try his luck there.

188
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,640
Old Taiyin set up a trial in Mount Wu.

189
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,320
Knowing what he can do,

190
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,080
a carrier pigeon won't be able
to reach Master.

191
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,400
Let's go to Mount Wu to find my father.

192
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,200
Be patient now.

193
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,679
You're still sick

194
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,239
and we're quite far from Mount Wu.

195
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:06,239
If you want to go there,

196
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,640
you have to make sure
you're fully recovered.

197
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:08,640
But...

198
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,200
I understand your concern.

199
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,559
Old Taiyin is almost as strong

200
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,760
as a deity.

201
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,239
He won't let any harm come
to the candidates in his trial.

202
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,359
Also,

203
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,119
you know how strong Master is,
don't you?

204
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,280
Don't worry.

205
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,559
Once you're healed,

206
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,919
I'll bring you there right away.

207
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,719
His Highness is placed
under house arrest by His Lordship,

208
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,039
but he still needs to be fed.

209
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,599
Your Highness, enjoy your meal.

210
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:49,239
I have news.

211
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,400
Only one person has been contacting

212
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,119
the housekeeper
of Duke Liang's Residence frequently.

213
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,719
It's someone from Lu Xiumu's Residence.

214
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,039
Lu Xiumu?

215
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:02,520
He guards the Examination Hall,

216
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,159
but he's also the culprit.

217
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,359
Baili found a perfect target this time.

218
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,239
It's hard to notice him.

219
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,880
Let Chuanyun and Chuanyu watch over
Lu's Residence

220
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,000
and see if they can find
anything useful.

221
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,080
Noted.

222
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:35,630
(Phoenix Palace, Yongzhou)

223
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:37,799
Look at you.

224
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,960
You went to the Imperial City
for the Six States banquet.

225
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,599
Why did you come back starved?

226
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,799
Spare me, Mother.

227
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:46,280
The food at the banquet
could be delicious

228
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,479
but no one had the appetite.

229
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,960
Once the banquet was over,

230
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,239
I rode back straight away.

231
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,840
Great timing then.

232
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,479
Feng Lanxi can never outwit you, Mother.

233
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,679
Unfortunately,

234
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,159
I missed the defeated look on him.

235
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,320
Your Highness,

236
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,039
Minister Wang said that other
than the true leaker,

237
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,559
everyone else had been dealt with.

238
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,679
You need to deal

239
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,760
with the true leaker yourself,
Your Highness.

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,640
I see.

241
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,559
Eat now.

242
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,520
Now that you're back,

243
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,320
help me with one thing.

244
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,119
Find someone to remove Lu Xiumu.

245
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,200
Lu Xiumu?

246
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,440
He's the leaker?

247
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,440
Remember.

248
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,359
Do not use our people.

249
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,760
Understood.

250
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:34,560
(Bafang Gambling House)

251
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,479
Have a safe trip.

252
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,919
A trinket!

253
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:39,960
It's quite delicious.

254
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:41,200
Try it.

255
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:42,645
(Bafang Gambling House)

256
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,039
Please help me, good sirs.

257
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,599
Please lend me two silver leaves.

258
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:46,679
Gu Yu,

259
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:49,119
you borrowed three silver leaves today.

260
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,119
Together with what you asked yesterday,

261
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,599
you have ten silver leaves in your debt.

262
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,039
You lost all your money every time.

263
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:55,400
Why are you gambling?

264
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,000
I saw this counter

265
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,799
where the dealer won 13 times in a row.

266
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
Can you give me another chance?

267
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,400
Do you want to win everything back?

268
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,880
Sure.

269
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,640
(Taihe Teahouse)
Settle your debt first

270
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,840
and we'll lend you more money.

271
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,799
I...

272
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,880
I'm borrowing money
so that I can win everything back.

273
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,479
Just this time.

274
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,200
I'll win and pay you back,
with interest too.

275
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:14,479
If you didn't give us
your official tablet

276
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,280
as a deposit last time,

277
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:17,119
we wouldn't give you a loan at all.

278
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,520
Your official tablet
is worth ten silver leaves at most.

279
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:22,239
You want another loan? Dream on.

280
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:23,880
Just give me another chance, please.

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,880
Move along.

282
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:25,880
Stop pestering us.

283
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,280
We have seen enough gambling addicts

284
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,119
like you.

285
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,280
I'm not a gambling addict!

286
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,080
Find yourself a mirror

287
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,760
and you'll see.

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,359
Right?

289
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:32,760
You...

290
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,280
What are you doing?

291
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,000
Let go of me.

292
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,840
Let go of him. Do you hear me?

293
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,359
Bring me two silver leaves.

294
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,080
So you're a robber now?

295
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,599
Today, I'll make sure

296
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,200
you pay for it!

297
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:46,160
(Taihe Teahouse)

298
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,760
Gu Yu,

299
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,440
do you know who we are?

300
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,760
You're doomed!

301
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,840
Let's see who will have the final laugh.

302
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,400
Stop fighting now, gentleman.

303
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:55,799
Who are you?

304
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,320
(Taihe Teahouse)
You are a skillful gentleman.

305
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:58,880
Don't get yourself into trouble

306
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,719
for a few

307
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,000
silver leaves.

308
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,520
I will settle the debt

309
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,159
on his behalf.

310
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,200
Please leave now.

311
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,159
Let go.

312
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,320
You know the rules, at least.

313
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:11,960
Let's go.

314
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,479
My official tablet?

315
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,599
Go.

316
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:18,760
What are you looking at?

317
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,880
Bugger off.

318
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,119
Go!

319
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,679
You chased away all the people.

320
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,760
Who can I borrow money from now?

321
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,880
If you want money,

322
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,200
I have a deal for you.

323
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,960
Do you want to take it?

324
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,200
Let's

325
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:35,960
talk in another place.

326
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,719
Xiyun,
I have been following Gu Yu lately.

327
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,679
He stays in the casino all the time.

328
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,039
Today, he used his official tablet

329
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,880
as a deposit to get a loan.

330
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,039
What has become of him?

331
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,919
Where is he now?

332
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,640
Someone settled the debt for him

333
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,280
in exchange for a favor.

334
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,080
They went to Sanliang Inn by the west.

335
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,239
I'll look for him.

336
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,559
Why do you need my help?

337
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,919
You are quite agile

338
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:05,440
so you must be skilled in martial arts.

339
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,200
I have a favor to ask.

340
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,559
What do you want me to do?

341
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,080
Kill someone

342
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
for me.

343
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:13,640
Kill someone?

344
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:15,400
I don't do that.

345
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,000
Mister,

346
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,320
hear me out

347
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,719
before you decide.

348
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,840
I want you

349
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,359
to kill a villain.

350
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,919
A villain?

351
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,719
He goes by the name of Lu Xiumu,

352
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:28,679
one of the Royal Guard Captains.

353
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,559
He is an arrogant tyrant who exploits
the commoners.

354
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:33,479
I am from Miancheng, you see.

355
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,640
He was once the Miancheng Army Commander

356
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,719
and he abused his power to occupy lands.

357
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,719
My parents died because of him.

358
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,640
I tried to bring justice to my parents

359
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,919
to no avail.

360
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:45,080
So,

361
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,679
I want him killed.

362
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,000
You want me

363
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,679
to kill an official?

364
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,239
He is a corrupted official.

365
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,880
I will offer you
a thousand silver leaves for it.

366
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,719
This is the certificate
for 500 silver leaves.

367
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,239
Once the deed is done,

368
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,960
you'll get another 500.

369
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:05,599
I will deliver it to you myself.

370
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,440
Is he truly a villain?

371
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,748
(Lu Xiumu's Residence, Yongzhou)

372
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,159
Assassinating a government official?

373
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,320
How dare you!

374
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,960
Someone!

375
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,359
Official Lu!

376
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,359
Official Lu!

377
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,039
I'll be guarding here.

378
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,440
Go to find the assassin.

379
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,000
All right.

380
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,559
- Go.
- Now.

381
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,679
- Go.
- Now.

382
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:47,640
Mu...

383
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,640
Mulan...

384
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,479
Official Lu?

385
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:56,479
Official Lu?

386
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,919
Mulan?

387
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,760
Why are you here?

388
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,919
I followed you here.

389
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:15,960
It seems like I'm late.

390
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,239
What did you do?

391
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,520
None of your business.

392
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,159
Stay there!

393
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:19,799
Move aside.

394
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:25,760
Stay there.

395
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,039
Bring him in.

396
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,239
Come.

397
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,280
Come.

398
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:44,760
(People from Fountain Abode?)

399
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,680
(Stellar Talent)
(Why are they)

400
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:01,159
(Stellar Talent)
(in Prince Yongping's Residence?)

401
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,400
(What did Gu Yu do?)

402
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,959
Xiyun, any news about Gu Yu?

403
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,560
I was late.

404
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,880
He assaulted a government official

405
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,319
and was taken away
by Prince Yongping's people.

406
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,560
Prince Yongping's people?

407
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,400
Mr. Lanxi of the Four Gentry?

408
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,359
Also, I noticed

409
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,920
that Prince Yongping is very close
to Fountain Abode.

410
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,760
Hei Fengxi of Fountain Abode.

411
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,839
Prince Yongping, Feng Lanxi.

412
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,880
There's only a one-character difference.

413
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,719
What is their relationship?

414
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,479
I should have noticed this earlier.

415
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,239
No ordinary man

416
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,040
can establish Fountain Abode

417
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,800
on his own within a decade.

418
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,680
The renowned Head of Fountain Abode

419
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
is the Second Prince of Yongzhou,
Feng Lanxi.

420
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,040
Two Gentries among the Four

421
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,079
are found in Yongzhou.

422
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,839
I didn't want to lie to you.

423
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,599
I just didn't have the opportunity
to tell you.

424
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,199
I know.

425
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,199
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

426
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,040
No one outside stopped me as well.

427
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,400
You came to me

428
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,800
for Gu Yu?

429
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,439
Gu Yu killed a government official.

430
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,119
It is a serious allegation.

431
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,719
There must be more to it.

432
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,839
He might have been used by someone.

433
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,560
Therefore,
I came to discuss this with you.

434
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,839
I know

435
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,599
you can definitely find out the truth.

436
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,520
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

437
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,920
So what exactly did he get himself into?

438
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,719
Let me explain to you slowly.

439
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,800
That is what happened.

440
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,199
Master once told us

441
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,400
that the disciples

442
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,520
of Tianshuang Sect should stay away
from politics.

443
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,800
Gu Yu made this mistake for money

444
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,640
and now,
he has to shoulder the consequences.

445
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,239
Your Highness.

446
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,079
Yes?

447
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,040
I just got news
from the Ministry of Justice.

448
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,079
Gu Yu killed himself with poison

449
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:12,920
before the interrogation.

450
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:18,880
I see.

451
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:19,839
You're dismissed for now.

452
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:20,560
Noted.

453
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,839
How can this be?

454
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,839
Gu Yu will never kill himself.

455
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,280
I will

456
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,000
get to the bottom of this.

457
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,400
I like the martial arts world

458
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:39,640
because you can settle the score
on the spot

459
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,000
unlike court,

460
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,560
where fighting is done in secret.

461
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
It's far more dangerous

462
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,959
than the blades
in the martial arts world.

463
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,760
Now that Lu Xiumu was killed by Gu Yu

464
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,040
and Gu Yu died in jail,

465
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:53,439
the clue was lost as well.

466
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:54,520
We should

467
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,680
find evidence of Lu Xiumu's leaking
the exam questions.

468
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,920
The exam papers were sealed.

469
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,439
They were unsealed under the supervision

470
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,160
of three invigilators.

471
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,839
How did Lu Xiumu

472
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,319
get the exam questions

473
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,040
from the sealed letters?

474
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,839
This cheating case

475
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,079
is Yongzhou's business.

476
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,199
I shouldn't meddle in it.

477
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:17,280
However, Gu Yu died for it.

478
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,920
So, I have to find out the truth.

479
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,599
I want

480
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,079
to investigate with you

481
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,719
and hopefully, we'll locate the culprit.

482
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,160
Can I have a look at the exam questions?

483
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,903
(31st year of Chunxi's reign. Yongzhou's
Law Examination. Ways to promote peace.)

484
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,359
Why has the color of the royal seal
faded so?

485
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,000
If you hadn't mentioned it,

486
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,520
I wouldn't have noticed it.

487
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:50,959
The seal paste for the royal seal

488
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,959
is made from good quality cinnabar
and honey.

489
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,119
Although it fades with time,

490
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,040
it shouldn't be this quick.

491
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,760
What does the seal have anything to do

492
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,439
with the leaking of exam questions?

493
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,680
It means

494
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,280
that the exam questions
have been tampered with.

495
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,199
The royal seal

496
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,079
is personally verified by my father.

497
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,000
Perhaps...

498
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,760
Perhaps this is

499
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,319
just part of the original
exam questions.

500
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,400
What do you mean?

501
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:24,479
This is a technique called
Palm of Duplication.

502
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,199
It's not hard.

503
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,400
You just need to manipulate
your inner force.

504
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,560
While I was traveling around,

505
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,880
I saw an artist drawing.

506
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,280
He drew a painting

507
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,599
and duplicated it
on several sheets of paper

508
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,439
before giving them a title.

509
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,599
And then, he asked someone to sell them.

510
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,000
Not only did he save more time,

511
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,199
but he also earned more money.

512
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,800
However, during the process,

513
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,359
the ink of the original drawing
will fade.

514
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,400
You will notice it
if you pay attention to it.

515
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:50,479
I suppose

516
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,680
martial arts world shenanigans like this

517
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,640
are too vulgar for your taste.

518
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,119
I see.

519
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,400
Thank you.

520
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,479
I merely want

521
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:10,160
to identify Gu Yu's killer.

522
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,839
We already identified
the modus operandi.

523
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,079
It's your turn to deal with the rest.

524
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,560
I shouldn't stay here for too long.

525
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,520
See you.

526
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:30,359
A criminal
who killed a government official

527
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,880
died in the jail of Ministry of Justice.

528
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:36,160
Any excuse, Zhang Zhongge?

529
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,680
No excuse, Your Lordship.

530
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,719
I have already asked my people

531
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,119
to investigate and find out the killer.

532
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,280
But

533
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:44,719
yesterday,

534
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,599
just when Prince Yongping suspected
Lu Xiumu of leaking the questions,

535
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,599
he was killed in his residence.

536
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,520
While the culprit confessed

537
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,839
that he killed Lu Xiumu due to
his occupation of lands,

538
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,079
I can't help but believe

539
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:04,800
that this has something to do
with the exam leaking scandal.

540
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,000
Give me the evidence.

541
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,000
Without evidence,
it's just speculations.

542
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,920
I can't do anything.

543
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,599
I...

544
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,599
Your Lordship,
Feng Qiwu requests an audience.

545
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:17,680
Show her in.

546
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:18,439
Noted.

547
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,680
You may get up.

548
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,800
Thank you, Your Lordship.

549
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,760
Greetings, Your Lordship.

550
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,719
May you live for millennia.

551
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,119
Have you

552
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,119
made any discoveries?

553
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,000
Your Lordship,

554
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,479
I discovered something huge.

555
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,599
Speak now.

556
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,880
I noticed that the questions
in our safekeeping

557
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,040
had been tampered with.

558
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,719
They are not the original copy.

559
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,838
(31st year of Chunxi's reign. Yongzhou's
Law Examination. Ways to promote peace.)

560
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:48,882
(31st year of Chunxi's reign. Yongzhou's
Law Examination. Ways to promote peace.)

561
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:00,760
Your Lordship,

562
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,479
I have served in the Ministry of Justice
for many years,

563
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,680
and never have I
seen a technique like this.

564
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,000
The ingenuity of it!

565
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:09,959
As such,

566
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,599
the three invigilators

567
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,560
were not the only ones privy
to the exam questions.

568
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,560
Another individual who could
steal the exam questions

569
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:18,119
was Lu Xiumu.

570
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,199
Your Lordship, this also proves

571
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,119
that Prince Yongping did not
frame Duke Liang

572
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,479
in an attempt to protect Official Pei.

573
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,680
Someone must have set everything up

574
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,479
and misled Prince Yongping.

575
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,079
I suggest we ransack

576
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,880
and search Lu's Residence thoroughly.

577
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:34,599
Permission granted.

578
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:35,920
Go now.

579
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,040
Noted, Your Lordship.

580
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,719
Thank you for your help, Minister Wang.

581
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,800
I will not forget the kindness
you showed today

582
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,959
and will repay you in the future.

583
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
You're welcome, Your Highness.

584
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,880
It's my duty.

585
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,439
After this,

586
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,319
Prince Yongping will lose

587
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,400
his title.

588
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,560
Lanxi was too impatient.

589
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,719
Otherwise, I wouldn't have dealt
such a heavy blow.

590
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,160
You are already quite merciful
with him, Your Highness.

591
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,160
Your Highness,

592
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,719
Feng Qiwu went to see His Lordship today

593
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,959
and was granted permission

594
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,760
to search Lu Xiumu's Residence.

595
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:25,719
Minister Wang,

596
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,479
did Lu Xiumu leave any evidence behind?

597
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,959
Our plan was concocted

598
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,719
through secret meetings.

599
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,520
There is no evidence whatsoever.

600
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,640
However...

601
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,520
Yes?

602
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:41,319
After Lu Xiumu stole the exam questions,

603
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:45,959
he burned them in front of me.

604
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,280
A heart can be treacherous.

605
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,280
He took the risk
and stole the exam questions.

606
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,839
He might have left something
to protect himself.

607
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:55,520
Go check the scene now.

608
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,280
Report to me if you have anything.

609
00:25:57,479 --> 00:25:58,319
Will do.

610
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,520
Stop!

611
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:14,599
May I ask what we did wrong?

612
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,760
Was Gu Yu with you?

613
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,160
Yes.

614
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,839
Around 9 PM the night before yesterday,
the suspect, Gu Yu,

615
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,680
assassinated the Royal Guard Captain,
Lu Xiumu.

616
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:23,920
He was captured

617
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,160
by the patrolling guards
while he was fleeing

618
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,479
and was locked up
in the Ministry of Justice.

619
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,959
He then killed himself with poison
in the jail last night.

620
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:29,439
What?

621
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,839
All of you are his sect mates

622
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,719
and will be detained in this courtyard
for the moment.

623
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,760
You are not allowed to head out.

624
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,479
Noted.

625
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,280
Seal the place.

626
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:41,239
Xiyun, is what he said true?

627
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,839
I didn't stop Gu Yu in time yesterday

628
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,079
and so, he made a grave mistake.

629
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,079
I didn't expect him to...

630
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,800
Why did Gu Yu do that?

631
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,640
What should we do now, Xiyun?

632
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,079
Gu Yu is a disciple
of the Tianshuang Sect.

633
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,880
No matter what,

634
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:00,079
I'll find out the mastermind
who manipulated him.

635
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,479
The officials are here on orders.

636
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:03,599
They won't give us a hard time.

637
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,560
Just wait for me.

638
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,079
I'll handle it.

639
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,079
Okay.

640
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:14,400
Feng Qiwu sealed Lu's Residence

641
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,479
and searched everywhere.

642
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,439
It seems like she couldn't find anything

643
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,719
and so, she returned to her home.

644
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:24,920
Check

645
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,680
if Lu Xiumu has another
private residence.

646
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:30,920
If he has the evidence,

647
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,839
he might have stashed it away
somewhere else.

648
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,280
If he has another private residence,

649
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,640
whether the evidence is in there or not,

650
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,520
just destroy it.

651
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,479
Better safe than sorry.

652
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:41,280
Noted.

653
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,974
(Lu's Residence)

654
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:53,119
Why are you here?

655
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,599
Chuanyun told me

656
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:56,239
that before Lu Xiumu died,

657
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,560
he uttered "Mulan".

658
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,280
I searched his residence

659
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,000
but I couldn't find anything
about Mulan.

660
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,280
Lu Xiumu is a foreigner.

661
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:06,479
He's good at mounted archery

662
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,599
so he must be a nomad.

663
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:12,920
I get it now.

664
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:14,199
The Mulan

665
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,839
Lu Xiumu uttered

666
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,680
is not the flower, Mulan,

667
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,199
but a hunting ground.

668
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,000
There are many ethnic groups
beyond the border

669
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,319
that speak different languages.

670
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,439
In one of the ethnic groups,

671
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,800
"Mulan" means a hunting ground.

672
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,479
Moments before Lu Xiumu passed away,

673
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:29,599
he wanted to convey a message.

674
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,719
It was so urgent

675
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,560
that he conveyed it
in his mother tongue.

676
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,280
I remember

677
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,760
this piece of info from Fountain Abode.

678
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,520
Lu Xiumu has another house
outside of the city

679
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,839
to keep the tools he used
for his hunting trip.

680
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,479
Good.

681
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,040
Sir.

682
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,599
Your Highness.

683
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,119
We have captured the arsonist.

684
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:24,640
This is what you requested.

685
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:31,640
(Royal Examination)

686
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,760
Have Minister Feng

687
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,359
deliver this evidence
to my father at once.

688
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:39,359
Yes, sir.

689
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:40,839
Zhong Li,

690
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,040
see Miss Feng back.

691
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:45,439
Yes, sir.

692
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:54,520
Feng Qiwu has shown me the evidence

693
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,719
that you weren't trying
to frame the allegation

694
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:00,000
to protect Pei Youshuo.

695
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,520
You

696
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,959
are free from now on.

697
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,520
Thanks, Father.

698
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,719
The arsonist who wanted to set fire
to Lu Xiumu's private residence

699
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:07,560
has been captured.

700
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,160
I believe we can locate the mastermind

701
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:10,839
after the interrogation.

702
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,880
Leaking exam questions,

703
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:16,000
framing, and killing
government officials

704
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,760
constitute a serious offense.

705
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,119
Have someone send them
to the Ministry of Justice

706
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,560
and let Zhang Zhongge take over.

707
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,800
You need not

708
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:25,439
worry about the rest.

709
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,680
What?

710
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,680
Do you still have something to tell me?

711
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:38,160
Father,

712
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,119
it might be an exam scandal

713
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,280
but you should be able to tell

714
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,680
that someone is trying to get rid of me.

715
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:46,439
Now that the truth has surfaced,

716
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:49,920
I pray that you can enforce justice.

717
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,359
You're worried
that I might be partial?

718
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,959
I dare not.

719
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,959
I have seen the evidence myself.

720
00:31:01,014 --> 00:31:01,967
(31st year of Chunxi's reign. Yongzhou's
Law Examination. Ways to promote peace.)

721
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,239
Naturally, I will set Pei Youshuo

722
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,880
as well as the innocent candidates free.

723
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:08,640
Of course,

724
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,920
the candidate who framed Pei Youshuo

725
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,359
will be severely punished.

726
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,920
Lu Xiumu who leaked the questions
has died

727
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,680
and his killer also died in jail.

728
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,719
I have asked

729
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,319
Zhang Zhongge
to get to the bottom of this.

730
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,479
What else do you want me to do?

731
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,560
I hope you can

732
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,359
identify the mastermind, Father.

733
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,599
Remember this then.

734
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,479
Lu Xiumu is the mastermind.

735
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,599
Father!

736
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,560
Xi.

737
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:43,040
You're the Prince Yongping.

738
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,719
You are a Prince with the title.

739
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,760
Not only are you my son,

740
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,959
but you also work for me.

741
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,199
As an official,

742
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:52,959
you need to look beyond yourself

743
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:54,920
and be concerned
about the bigger picture.

744
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,119
Everything has shown

745
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:58,680
that Lu Xiumu

746
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:01,239
is the main culprit.

747
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:02,680
Did I make myself clear?

748
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,800
Father, you know very well

749
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,199
that if you continue investigating,

750
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,880
she will be implicated.

751
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:17,839
But Father,

752
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,439
you would leave her be?

753
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,839
What I want

754
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,880
is a stable and united

755
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:29,319
Yongzhou.

756
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,599
Only then

757
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,079
can Yongzhou survive

758
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,319
the infighting of all Six States.

759
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:37,839
What you went through is nothing

760
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,800
compared with the stakes

761
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,680
in Yongzhou.

762
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,439
Dismissed.

763
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,040
If you say so.

764
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,839
(The balance of power
between several parties)

765
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:59,079
(can make sure Yongzhou
remains stabilized.)

766
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,719
(It is the safest way.)

767
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,520
Mentor. Mentor.

768
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,280
Mentor.

769
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,040
Mentor.

770
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,760
I regret my mistake.

771
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,400
If you still regard me as your mentor,

772
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:42,280
why did you forget

773
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,199
the word I wrote you?

774
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:49,754
(Pine)

775
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,199
Sihan,

776
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,520
you're the most suited for politics
among them.

777
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,880
But you're also the one
with the most shortcomings.

778
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,880
Pine. This is the word
I wish to give you.

779
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,839
Stand tall and resilient
like the pine tree.

780
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:04,360
(Pine)

781
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,680
(Pine)
Before long,

782
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,920
you will be the pillar of the world.

783
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,919
I made a mistake.

784
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,520
I was enticed by the position
they promised me.

785
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,760
I wanted a head start on my career

786
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:21,479
and now, I have finally understood

787
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,600
the weight of your words.

788
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,840
I regret it very much so.

789
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,199
Mentor.

790
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,360
Mentor! Mentor!

791
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,120
His Lordship has arrived!

792
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,080
Greetings, Your Lordship.

793
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:13,520
May you live for millennia.

794
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,959
All of you are dismissed.

795
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,080
You may stand up now.

796
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,239
Lift your head up.

797
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:38,639
Look at me.

798
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,479
You have no courage
to look at me anymore?

799
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:46,679
Lift your head up.

800
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,360
I do have the courage.

801
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,040
I just don't want to face your wrath.

802
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,360
I have been your wife
for more than two decades.

803
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,360
I don't have it in me

804
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,360
to witness the disappointment
in your eyes.

805
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,719
In that case,

806
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,080
why did you do what you did?

807
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,879
You framed my ministers.

808
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,399
You violated my laws.

809
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,399
And you even wanted to kill my son.

810
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,239
How can I protect you now
in front of everyone?

811
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,040
I plead guilty

812
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,959
to all those crimes, Your Lordship.

813
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:25,800
Feng Ju is still your son,

814
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,439
Your Lordship.

815
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,399
Please spare him.

816
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,199
He went to the Imperial City
on your behalf.

817
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,600
He isn't aware of all these.

818
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:36,120
How can you stoop to this level?

819
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,800
You think Lanxi will be an easy target

820
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,360
following the death of Yige?

821
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:44,520
The imperial bloodline flows within him.

822
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,080
He is my legitimate son.

823
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,320
You know,

824
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:50,639
many have criticized my indecision

825
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,840
in giving him the title of an heir.

826
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:55,959
And now,
you should do these kind of things.

827
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,399
What can I do now?

828
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,080
I know,

829
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,199
Your Lordship.

830
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:04,040
I just don't want to see him.

831
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,479
Whenever I see him,

832
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,120
I'll be reminded of Yige.

833
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,600
I'll be reminded of the pain
of separation we had to endure.

834
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,919
I have to do this.

835
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,879
I want him to fail.

836
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,800
Only then will I find peace

837
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,280
with the suffering I went through.

838
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,800
Enough!

839
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:21,959
Ridiculous.

840
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,639
We were madly in love, Your Lordship.

841
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:28,840
But Yige broke us up.

842
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,080
For five whole years,

843
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:35,120
I couldn't even see you.

844
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,639
This pain of separation.

845
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,760
This forlornness.

846
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,679
I wish to forget them

847
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,199
but I can't.

848
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,520
I have stopped Lanxi

849
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,040
from investigating further.

850
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,080
I have also dealt with

851
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:25,879
the arsonist you sent
to burn the residence.

852
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,560
I know you had it rough.

853
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,520
But many years have gone by.

854
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,919
Let bygones be bygones.

855
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,000
What you need to do now

856
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,159
is to be on the same page as mine

857
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:46,399
and unify Yongzhou.

858
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:47,040
That's how

859
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:49,040
we will survive

860
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,199
this infighting.

861
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,439
Understood?

862
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,320
Mentor,

863
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,120
why are you here?

864
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:18,360
I have been waiting for you,
Your Highness.

865
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,800
What can I help, Mentor?

866
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,360
I have heard what happened
in the royal palace.

867
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,800
Now that you're officially
on Baili's bad side,

868
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:36,399
it's but a matter of time

869
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,439
before a battle of usurpation.

870
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,000
I just want to give you my advice,
Your Highness.

871
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,320
A temporary gain or loss
is much more trivial

872
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,040
than the bigger picture.

873
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,639
You also want me to let go, Mentor?

874
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:57,000
If you want to be the heir,

875
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,120
you have to make some compromises.

876
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,280
Besides,

877
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,360
you want more

878
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,239
than Yongzhou, don't you, Your Highness?

879
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,679
You have a great ambition,
Your Highness.

880
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,719
All the more reasons to know

881
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,439
that many more sufferings

882
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:16,239
await you.

883
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:19,600
The exile of Su Wu

884
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:21,320
and the humiliation Han Xin endured,

885
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,600
all of them gave way
to a greater purpose.

886
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,080
Besides,

887
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,239
I also heard

888
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
that Queen Baili once asked

889
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,120
about your marriage prospect.

890
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,959
To prevent further troubles,

891
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,719
consider

892
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,360
wedding Miss Feng Qiwu, Your Highness.

893
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,360
As you said just now, Mentor,

894
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,639
in my journey,

895
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:44,800
there's no room for romance.

896
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:47,080
A wife? Let's save it for the future.

897
00:40:49,919 --> 00:40:50,959
I am tired now.

898
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,000
Your Highness,

899
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:56,040
I will leave then.

900
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:03,120
(Everyone wants me to let go)

901
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,120
(and look at the bigger picture.)

902
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,719
(But I am doing this)

903
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,520
(to settle the score.)
