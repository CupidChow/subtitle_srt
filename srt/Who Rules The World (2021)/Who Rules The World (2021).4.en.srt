I don't want to negotiate.

21
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
I want you to surrender!

22
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:46,181
(Luocheng)

23
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,559
It seems it's not up to you to decide.

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,080
Tell the commanding officer.

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,919
You want to see him in person?

26
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:52,879
Very well.

27
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,199
I'll take your head to him right away!

28
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,919
If you won't relay my words,

29
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,360
I'll do it myself.

30
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,440
I, Yu Wuyuan,

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,440
seek an audience with the Commander
of Shangzhou army.

32
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,080
I, Yu Wuyuan,

33
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,679
seek an audience with the Commander
of Shangzhou army.

34
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,559
As in The Finest Gentry, Mr. Yu?

35
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:28,919
Unfortunately,

36
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,119
I haven't had the chance to meet him.

37
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,759
If

38
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,919
I had to befriend
one person in this world,

39
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,759
it would be him.

40
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,800
It would be him?

41
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,800
Never have I

42
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,320
heard something preposterous like this.

43
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,639
Thanks to your lofty status,

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
of course, you have never heard,

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,679
Prince Huang.

46
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,960
How do you know

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,919
I'm Huang Chao?

48
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,600
I don't mean to brag

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
but after many years
in the martial arts world,

50
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,919
not many can stand toe to toe
against me.

51
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,199
Let me count.

52
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:05,960
Not more than five of them.

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,279
You exude a regal aura.

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,960
Recognizing you is not a challenge.

55
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,600
Besides,

56
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,440
you're escorted by General Saoxue,

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,960
Xiao Xuekong.

58
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:18,839
Your little brother was behaving
suspiciously

59
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,839
and I thought he was an assassin.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,479
Pardon my insolence.

61
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,800
This brat sullied my attire with dust.

62
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,960
I wanted to teach him a good spanking

63
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,399
but he is more agile than a bunny.

64
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,639
He deserved a small fright.

65
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,199
Since it's just a misunderstanding,

66
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,000
no hard feelings, General Saoxue.

67
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,000
You have found out

68
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,320
our identities

69
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,679
but yours remains hidden from us.

70
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,960
I suppose my identification skill

71
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,559
is far inferior.

72
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:48,520
There aren't a lot of
powerful female fighters out there.

73
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,320
The best among them is Bai Fengxi.

74
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,080
And then, it's Princess Xiyun

75
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,479
and Qiu Jiushuang.

76
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,520
Jiushuang is my subordinate.

77
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,919
As for Bai Fengxi,

78
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,279
I have never met her

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
but I heard she loves plain white robes

80
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,080
and is as beautiful as she is lethal.

81
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,080
You...

82
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,440
Definitely,
I'm not the beautiful and lethal

83
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,360
Bai Fengxi.

84
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,199
If you can rinse your face

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,279
and let me have a proper look at you...

86
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,839
I guess I'd better take a bath

87
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,799
on top of rinsing my face.

88
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Are you going to tail me

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,160
just to have a proper look at me?

90
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,559
I am willing to heat the water

91
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,559
and serve you towels.

92
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,440
How about you?
Calling it quits now?

93
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,359
Not necessarily.

94
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,079
Having a prince serve me?

95
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,600
Even His Majesty in his gilded hall

96
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,679
does not have this privilege,

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
let alone a commoner like me.

98
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,200
I can't accept it.

99
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,359
Then,

100
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,519
I shall turn these mountains
into a lake one day.

101
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,799
And then,

102
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,480
I will invite you

103
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:58,799
for a soothing bath.

104
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,640
Sure.

105
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,119
Deal.

106
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:02,600
Deal.

107
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:10,359
I'm hungry.

108
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,119
Treat me to a meal.

109
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,959
Here, please.

110
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,119
Let's go.

111
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,679
Greetings, Mr. Yu.
I'm Fan Shiji of Shangzhou.

112
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,320
Greetings, Commander Fan.

113
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,959
(Shangzhou Army Commander, Fan Shiji)
How may I help?

114
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,480
I have a favor to ask.

115
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,839
Please let peace return to this world.

116
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,679
You're the so-called Finest Gentry.

117
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,519
(Luocheng)
Finest

118
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:49,200
indeed.

119
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,079
At the moment,

120
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,440
it's but a matter of time before
Shangzhou claims this city.

121
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,399
You think one sentence is enough

122
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,200
to persuade me to retreat?

123
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,279
You might be the Yu Wuyuan

124
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:01,320
but don't be ridiculous.

125
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,279
The Imperial Family lost the token

126
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:04,720
but they are still the Imperial Family.

127
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,000
Revolting now

128
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,600
is an act of treason.

129
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,079
A siege right now

130
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:11,079
will uproot countless commoners

131
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,440
and hurt the innocents.

132
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
That's an act of cruelty.

133
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,079
(Luocheng)
This war from you, Commander Fan,

134
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,200
is a war of treason and cruelty.

135
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,320
There is no right or wrong in a war.

136
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,920
Heed my advice, Commander Fan.

137
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:26,559
All Six States

138
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,040
have their own agenda.

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,760
If you

140
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,160
insist on waging
this war of cruelty and treason,

141
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,200
you give the other States

142
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
a reason to invade Shangzhou.

143
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,040
Shangzhou is an affluent state

144
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,320
but it doesn't have the strongest
military among all States.

145
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,519
If the other States decide to invade...

146
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sure you can picture

147
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,079
the consequences

148
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,679
very well, Commander Fan.

149
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,040
I concur, Mr. Yu.

150
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,440
However, I merely follow an order.

151
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,679
So you want

152
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,600
an excuse.

153
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:01,640
Luocheng is situated at the
intersection of three States.

154
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
All Shangzhou merchants

155
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,320
have to go through here.

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,079
If you can retreat now, Commander Fan,

157
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,200
I will convince the governor

158
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,600
to exempt

159
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,160
the taxes on Shangzhou.

160
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,320
Can I believe in your words?

161
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,000
Definitely.

162
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,160
Good.

163
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,720
I will return to the encampment

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,760
and deliver this news

165
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,279
to my lord as soon as possible.

166
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,079
Thank you.

167
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:25,880
Retreat!

168
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,760
One sentence to stop a war.

169
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,079
As expected from Mr. Yu.

170
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,440
Thank you.

171
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,959
I want this roasted duck.

172
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,000
Sharing is caring, okay?

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,720
I'll have it first.

174
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,320
No.

175
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:45,880
Move your dirty paws.

176
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,320
This is a pot of Drunken Rouge!

177
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:55,760
What's a Drunken Rouge?

178
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:57,679
Is this Drunken Rouge?

179
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
It is.

180
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,079
One thousand pieces of gold for a pot.

181
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,600
Not bad.

182
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:04,559
Pu.

183
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,600
Let's wash our hands.

184
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,440
You...

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,839
The rest is for you.

186
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,600
Tasty.

187
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,840
Pu.

188
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:40,559
Pack up these leftovers.

189
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:52,960
I hope

190
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,159
you don't mind the rushed meal.

191
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,320
Prince Huang,

192
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,559
you treated my brother
and me to a feast.

193
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,039
I have to pay up, of course.

194
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,640
This is for you.

195
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,400
However, a certain black foxy

196
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,119
said it might be a counterfeit.

197
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,320
Find out

198
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
yourself then.

199
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,960
Pu, are you done?

200
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,119
See you.

201
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:15,520
Have a safe journey.

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,719
What a pity to have wasted
the pot of Drunken Rouge.

203
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,880
Yingzhou's blade.

204
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,159
It's her.

205
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:37,840
She is Bai Fengxi.

206
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,679
Both of us

207
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,919
have been misled by
"as beautiful as she is lethal".

208
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:47,280
We thought she
would be an unparalleled beauty

209
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,760
but I wasn't prepared

210
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,640
to meet her like this.

211
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,119
No wonder she's the oddest woman
in the world.

212
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,440
Your Highness,

213
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,000
do we return to Jizhou?

214
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:58,760
She said the token was a counterfeit.

215
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,119
We'll

216
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,880
need to corroborate with Wuyuan.

217
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:03,520
Let's head to the Tianshuang Sect first.

218
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,799
Why?

219
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:06,359
Miss Feng gave us this generous gift.

220
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,000
We shouldn't be indebted to her.

221
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,960
I'll deal

222
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,159
with her troubles.

223
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,093
(Shangzhou Encampment)

224
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,919
Greetings, Eunuch Liu.

225
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
(Shangzhou Eunuch, Eunuch Liu)
Commander Fan,

226
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,880
(Shangzhou Eunuch, Eunuch Liu)
why did you raise the truce flag?

227
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,239
Yu Wuyuan came

228
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:30,359
to negotiate today.

229
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,280
I have already penned the conditions

230
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,799
he agreed to

231
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,640
into a memorandum

232
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,200
and had it delivered
to the capital of the state now.

233
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,559
I...

234
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,280
Are you afraid

235
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,599
of Yu Wuyuan?

236
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,359
His Lordship wanted you
to claim the city.

237
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,000
A conquest

238
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,960
is unwise.

239
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:49,320
Do you know why

240
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:52,559
His Lordship sent me here
to oversee the operation?

241
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
It's because

242
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,760
you had quite the pacifist approach

243
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,479
in the court meeting.

244
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,159
His Lordship sent me here

245
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,760
to make sure you claim the city.

246
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,960
Do you wish to defy the royal order?

247
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,960
Exceptions are tolerated
during emergencies.

248
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,479
I will

249
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,320
answer to His Lordship myself

250
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,799
back in the imperial court.

251
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,119
You need not worry.

252
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,280
Back in the imperial court?

253
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,000
It seems like

254
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,159
you will not rescind your decision.

255
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:29,799
In that case,

256
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,520
you're not needed in the imperial court.

257
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:32,239
Someone!

258
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,760
Take Fan Shiji down!

259
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,599
How dare you?

260
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:37,960
Liu Changxiu.

261
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,599
Insolent!

262
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:45,359
Am I?

263
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,400
Well,

264
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,239
His Lordship

265
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,159
(Shangzhou)
gave me this golden token.

266
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,960
I am here to restore the military order
on behalf of His Lordship.

267
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:55,239
Fan Shiji malpracticed before a war.

268
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,280
Behead him to sacrifice to the flag.

269
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,400
Noted.

270
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:58,640
Let's go.

271
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,520
Liu Changxiu!

272
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,520
You're ruining our nation!

273
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,640
(Luocheng)

274
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:10,039
Impressive, Mr. Yu.

275
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:11,039
You solved this crisis

276
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,400
within a few words.

277
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,919
Bravo.

278
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,440
I merely follow my ancestors' teachings

279
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,159
and wish to avert unrest in this world.

280
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,880
Even though Commander Fan has raised
the truce flag,

281
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:24,799
it's far from over yet.

282
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,200
Sir,

283
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,000
the Shangzhou army is laying siege to us.

284
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:29,799
What?

285
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,279
Mr. Yu...

286
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,280
Commander Fan may have been usurped.

287
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,359
In that case,

288
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:39,880
I wish to live and die with Luocheng.

289
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,320
The world can live without Luocheng

290
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,679
but the world can't live
without you, Mr. Yu.

291
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,039
I wanted a truce.

292
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:48,479
But if a war breaks out,

293
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,919
I am confident
that I can help Luocheng to win it.

294
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,204
(Dadong)

295
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,960
Let all of them

296
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,359
assume the Sancai Array.

297
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,880
All of you by the main gate,
follow my orders.

298
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,359
Assume the Xuannang Array
and buy us more time.

299
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,440
Yes, sir.

300
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:22,359
Sound the drums to boost the morale.

301
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,160
(Shang)

302
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,479
Help!

303
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,359
Help!

304
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,479
I'm here to save you.

305
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,640
To save me?

306
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:09,039
I don't understand.

307
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,479
If you attack right now,

308
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,640
the one being flanked
is the Shangzhou army.

309
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,280
The Skyrider Cavalry of Jizhou
is on their way.

310
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,080
They will be here in half a day.

311
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,039
Besides,

312
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,479
you do not stand a chance

313
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:22,599
against Yu Wuyuan at all.

314
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:25,239
Is this a threat?

315
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,280
A threat?

316
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,159
Who do you think you are?

317
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,719
You still have some use for me.

318
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,719
Otherwise, I'll leave you
high and dry today.

319
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,799
Inform the Lord of Shangzhou.

320
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,479
If he starts a war,

321
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,000
the first state to fall
will be Shangzhou.

322
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,320
Or,

323
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,119
before the zeal of war
gets to his brain,

324
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,280
let me enter the royal palace of Shangzhou

325
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,719
to calm him down.

326
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,799
If not,

327
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,520
let me treat that rotten tooth of his.

328
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,599
How did you know

329
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,880
this secret illness of His Lordship?

330
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,119
I know a lot of things.

331
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,080
So what I said just now

332
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,960
was not an empty threat.

333
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,960
Remember

334
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:04,119
to relay my words
to the Lord of Shangzhou.

335
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,359
Some people give in easily to greed.

336
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,359
I hope he isn't one.

337
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,320
You

338
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,479
too.

339
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:14,898
(Shang)

340
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
Retreat!

341
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:31,117
(Luocheng)

342
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,239
Greetings, Mr. Fengxi.

343
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,640
How do you know it's me?

344
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,960
Not many people

345
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,960
can saunter into an army

346
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,239
as you did.

347
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
It is an honor

348
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,599
to meet you, Mr. Yu.

349
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,880
I will wait for you
in Sunset Restaurant tonight.

350
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,599
Sir, the Shangzhou army has retreated.

351
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,960
Did they?

352
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:01,840
A Mr. Fengxi appeared

353
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:03,479
and walked among the Shangzhou army.

354
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,359
And then, they withdrew.

355
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,359
Two of The Four Gentry have arrived.

356
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,880
God is on our side.

357
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,039
Make a public announcement.

358
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,320
Let's celebrate the whole night!

359
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,520
Thank you

360
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,320
for your intervention, Mr. Feng.

361
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,359
Even if I didn't help,

362
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,280
you could deal with it too, Mr. Yu.

363
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,119
After all, the Skyrider Cavalry
was truly on the way.

364
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,440
Huang Chao will never let you
take this risk.

365
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,559
That's why you were so composed.

366
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:34,359
Shangzhou would have lost the war.

367
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:35,960
Nothing

368
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,520
escapes the discerning eyes
of Fountain Abode.

369
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:43,520
Everyone also knows
that Prince Huang

370
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,559
regards you as his one-sentence tutor.

371
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,359
Shangzhou wanted to violate the accord

372
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,719
and laid waste to people's lives.

373
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,640
I

374
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,559
just don't want an unnecessary war

375
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,520
to take place.

376
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,119
Regardless of the outcome,

377
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,799
if lives have to be sacrificed,

378
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,359
it is a grave mistake.

379
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,080
How serendipitous!

380
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,719
I share the same thought.

381
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,199
Mr. Yu, shall we

382
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:10,119
enjoy the fine wine
in Sunset Restaurant?

383
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,040
Rich

384
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,800
and refreshing.

385
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,199
Simply divine.

386
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,199
Judging from the decor
of this restaurant,

387
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,959
I can tell the owner

388
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,000
finds elegance in simplicity,

389
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:28,280
sophistication in banality.

390
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,319
I haven't seen a masterwork like this
in a long while.

391
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,239
As the setting sun lights this room

392
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,239
and the cranes' cry fills the sky,

393
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,520
a Jiangnan wanderer

394
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,359
gazes upon his blade.

395
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,359
He hits the railings repeatedly.

396
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,000
No one knows

397
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,760
the emotion he feels in the room.

398
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,439
I wonder what the owner was feeling

399
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,319
when he saw this restaurant

400
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,359
slowly come into being.

401
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,560
Perhaps he infused
his unshared sentiments

402
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,119
into this building.

403
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,119
But Mr. Yu, you do have

404
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,359
a confidant, don't you?

405
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,800
I

406
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,359
am not a sentimental person.

407
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,359
I definitely do not share
a poet's sensitivity.

408
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,359
What a shame.

409
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:16,240
(Peace and Harmony)

410
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,479
Sir, a missive.

411
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,119
What good news

412
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,880
did Prince Huang give you?

413
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,920
You were so engrossed.

414
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,280
Mr. Feng, how do you know

415
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,079
it's from Prince Huang?

416
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:47,360
(Peace and Harmony)

417
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:50,479
Silk paper is exclusive
to the royal family of Jizhou.

418
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:53,359
A commoner will not use it
to compose a missive.

419
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,959
There are two good and one bad news
in the missive.

420
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,479
The bad news

421
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,719
is about the death of Yan Yingzhou.

422
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,359
One of the good news

423
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:05,599
should be

424
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:07,599
about the Empyrean Token.

425
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,199
Yingzhou sacrificed himself
to protect the token.

426
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,800
How selfless.

427
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,839
As for the other good news.

428
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,479
It's Bai Fengxi.

429
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,119
Prince Huang said he met
Heroine Fengxi on the mountain

430
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,079
outside of Tianshuang Sect.

431
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,280
She gave him

432
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:23,800
the Empyrean Token.

433
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:25,439
He also

434
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,359
commended

435
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,719
her beauty.

436
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,839
Only she can get such a compliment

437
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,560
from

438
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,760
Prince Huang, I reckon.

439
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:40,560
Why is running into her good news?

440
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,560
In my humble opinion,

441
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,560
meeting

442
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,719
the other half of Hei-Bai Fengxi,

443
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,599
Heroine Fengxi,

444
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,520
is also worthy of a celebration.

445
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,280
The way I see it,

446
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,719
meeting her has to be
the worst thing to happen to me.

447
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,839
It's up to you

448
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,319
how you interpret it.

449
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,079
I still have to attend to something.

450
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,000
I will leave now.

451
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,199
May we dine together

452
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,800
another time,

453
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,040
Mr. Feng.

454
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
(Peace and Harmony)

455
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,199
(Stopping a war in Luocheng,)

456
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,839
(concerned about the world,)

457
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:25,359
(this Mr. Yu does not fail
his reputation at all.)

458
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:28,040
(Huang Chao nabbed him to his side.)

459
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,599
(He's ambitious, isn't he?)

460
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:48,000
Bai Fengxi, you have finally returned.

461
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:49,280
Hand over the Empyrean Token.

462
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:51,000
Another group of token hunters.

463
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,319
I have delivered the token to Huang Chao

464
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,040
per Yan Yingzhou's request.

465
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,719
Nonsense.

466
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,640
We watch all Jizhou egresses closely.

467
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:57,599
You were never spotted.

468
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:58,920
Who said I went to Jizhou?

469
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,160
Can't Huang Chao walk?

470
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,400
He can travel around.

471
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,760
Who can testify

472
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
that you handed it to Huang Chao?

473
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,040
Me.

474
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,400
It's the Prince Huang Chao.

475
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,000
Gentlemen.

476
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,760
I have the Empyrean Token.

477
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,319
If you want to have it,

478
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:15,520
come at me.

479
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,280
He's calm and collected.

480
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:19,359
His Skyrider Cavalry must be nearby.

481
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:19,839
Right.

482
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,239
Since you have the token, Your Highness,

483
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,359
we'll take our leave then.

484
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:23,839
Farewell.

485
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:24,839
Farewell.

486
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Thank you.

487
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:34,119
Within a day,

488
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
everyone will know.

489
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,319
I want everyone to know

490
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,439
that Jizhou has the Empyrean Token.

491
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,479
To keep troubles to the minimum,

492
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,280
I should head back now.

493
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,680
See you, Heroine Feng.

494
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,800
See you.

495
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,560
Let's go.

496
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,640
Feng.

497
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,319
Will Mr. Huang Chao be the next Emperor?

498
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,479
Emperor of a new dynasty?

499
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,079
Maybe

500
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:05,800
or maybe not.

501
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,160
But he speaks like one.

502
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:11,839
Martial Sister!

503
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,040
Guess, who is he?

504
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,479
Who?

505
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,359
Come.

506
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:17,920
Martial Sister, you're back.

507
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,280
How are you?

508
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,319
Good.

509
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:21,640
This is...

510
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:22,920
He's Han Pu.

511
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:25,199
Something bad happened to his family
so I brought him here.

512
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,199
Taking someone in every day.

513
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:29,119
Are you the leader of the sect?

514
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,640
Why are you complaining this time?

515
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,719
You weren't when I brought

516
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,280
Jiurong here.

517
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,319
I don't know what you're talking about.

518
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,920
Forget it.

519
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,479
If Father didn't ask me to pick you up,

520
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,479
I wouldn't be here.

521
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,119
Right, my master.

522
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,119
Come.

523
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:45,640
Let's go.

524
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,000
If you don't come with me,

525
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,560
I don't know who to give this
newly-bought rouge.

526
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,520
Wait, Martial Sister.

527
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,169
(Tianshuang Sect)

528
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,319
Master.

529
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,079
How are you?

530
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,520
My dear master.

531
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,479
Finally,

532
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:17,920
you're back.

533
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,239
Yes, I am.

534
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,680
Tianshuang Sect is my home.

535
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,400
Also,

536
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,800
aren't you waiting for me?

537
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,000
Your home? This is my home.

538
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,439
Langhua,

539
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,439
don't forget

540
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,880
that when I came here to be a disciple,
you weren't even here.

541
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,079
Seniority matters.

542
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,000
Understood?

543
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,199
- Father, look at her.
- Enough.

544
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,239
Stop bickering.

545
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,959
Langhua, ask the chefs
to prepare more dishes.

546
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,439
Today, we celebrate
your martial sister's return

547
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,000
and we shall have a feast!

548
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,800
Yes!

549
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,280
Noted.

550
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,439
Go now.

551
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,439
You saved Yan Yingzhou
and protected the Empyrean Token.

552
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:47,959
Your news preceded your presence

553
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,400
this time.

554
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:50,920
Tell me everything.

555
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,280
Have a seat.

556
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,760
I'll tell you everything.

557
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,199
Come.

558
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,839
Apparently, the token is a counterfeit.

559
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,359
A counterfeit?

560
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,439
That's what Black Foxy said.

561
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh,

562
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,800
I fought people
from the Soultaker Sect too.

563
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,000
Soultaker Sect?

564
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,719
It is a mysterious sect.

565
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,920
Even the Fountain Abode

566
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,640
does not

567
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,000
have a complete grasp on them.

568
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:17,800
My encounter with them showed me

569
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,400
that there were many powerful foes there.

570
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
They are particularly adept
in Longsword Formation, Six Ghost Formation,

571
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:23,560
and Octo-Ghost Soul Formation.

572
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,479
They are all lethal techniques.

573
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,079
The disciples of Soultaker Sect

574
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:28,239
are ruthless

575
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,760
to their foes

576
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,880
and to themselves

577
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,239
alike.

578
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,920
The sudden rise of Soultaker Sect

579
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,160
must be backed by something else.

580
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
When Black Foxy and I

581
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,680
were dismantling their branch
in Yucheng,

582
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,800
we found a handkerchief.

583
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:46,359
It was embroidered with
Locust and Cricket.

584
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:49,160
Black Foxy said they were two
mythical beasts.

585
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,719
You sure it was embroidered
with Locust and Cricket?

586
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,119
Yes.

587
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,640
Did that jog your memory?

588
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,479
I can't believe

589
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,520
they made a comeback.

590
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,839
Who?

591
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,520
The battle in the year of Chongde.

592
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:13,079
The Battle of Chongde?

593
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,000
Yes.

594
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,239
In the fifth year of Chongde,

595
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,760
a mysterious army

596
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,439
invaded the Imperial City out of a sudden.

597
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,800
No one knew where they came from.

598
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,319
They were just

599
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:26,439
cold-blooded and well-coordinated
combatants.

600
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:29,239
The Imperial Family was in great peril.

601
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,199
Fortunately, the Six States

602
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,760
were still in a close relationship
with the Imperial Family.

603
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,119
Therefore, all heroes and all armies
went to assist the Imperial Ci.

604
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,280
An uprising was then thwarted.

605
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,439
On the military flags
of this mysterious army

606
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,079
were Locust and Cricket.

607
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,839
They laid low for a century

608
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,800
and now, they re-emerge
as the Soultaker Sect.

609
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
Should we not eliminate

610
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,719
such pests, the world

611
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,079
will be in chaos again.

612
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,439
Show me.

613
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,640
Come.

614
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,359
Are you used to everything now?

615
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,319
Remember this, Han Pu.

616
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,160
No need to grow up quickly.

617
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,439
If you want to be

618
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,040
who you want to be,

619
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,719
train hard.

620
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,839
If you have a goal,

621
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:19,959
your life will be meaningful.

622
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:22,839
I want to be as strong as you.

623
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,680
You will be stronger than me.

624
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,439
So Prince Huang

625
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:32,119
wants to be an Emperor

626
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,079
who rules on his throne?

627
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,719
But

628
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,000
won't he be lonely?

629
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,239
An Emperor is always lonely

630
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,640
because he has no friends.

631
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,439
But he has

632
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:45,520
absolute power, honor,

633
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,959
and bottomless riches.

634
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:49,479
That's a fair trade-off.

635
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,319
But

636
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,280
he can't have them when he's dead.

637
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:56,880
Mother used to say

638
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,400
that when we're dead,
everything will be gone,

639
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,000
and disappear like a wisp of smoke.

640
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:03,680
Who said the Emperor can't bring
the wealth with him?

641
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,239
He will be buried with many
exotic treasures.

642
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,000
His consorts will die for him as well.

643
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,040
He won't be lonely.

644
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,839
But

645
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,800
they are not doing it
out of their own volition.

646
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,800
If they don't truly love him,

647
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,800
the Emperor won't be able to find them
in the afterlife.

648
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,760
He'll still be lonely.

649
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,839
You mean true love?

650
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,319
It is quite rare

651
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,839
in this world.

652
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,680
You're still a child.
Why are you thinking about these?

653
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,400
Just train hard

654
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,640
and become stronger.

655
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,439
All right?

656
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,760
I want to be strong enough

657
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,640
to protect you.

658
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,199
Sure. I'll wait for your protection.

659
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:49,673
(Yongzhou Border)

660
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,880
Your Highness,
during the military exercise today,

661
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,439
you bested your brother.

662
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,079
Congratulations.

663
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,479
Wang Yuan, where are we now?

664
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:05,359
We're less than ten li away
from Mount Jing.

665
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,359
Let's spend a night in the relay station

666
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,160
over there

667
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,760
(Yongzhou's Third Prince, Feng Ju)
and resume our journey tomorrow.

668
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,119
Is Feng Chang there too?

669
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,440
(Feng Ju's Retainer, Wang Yuan)
First Prince's carriage

670
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,160
(Feng Ju's Retainer, Wang Yuan)
is faster than ours.

671
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,640
They must have checked in, I reckon.

672
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,239
I don't want to spend a night with him.

673
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,719
If we're ten li away from Mount Jing,

674
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:22,880
we're not that far away
from the Hot Spring Palace.

675
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,959
It is 100 li away from here

676
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,479
but it's located in the west.

677
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,319
Let's visit the Hot Spring Palace then.

678
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,439
Your Highness,
the Second Prince lives there.

679
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:34,520
Father asked him to convalesce there.

680
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,560
He didn't give the entire palace to him.

681
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,000
Why do I have to stay
in a relay station?

682
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,239
Let's go.

683
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,160
Chuanyu.

684
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,279
(Hot Spring Palace, Yongzhou)

685
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,599
Miss Huan.

686
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,520
No dutiful guard will be

687
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,439
(Lanxi Residence's Steward, Miss Huan)
practicing swords

688
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,319
while his master is still recovering
from an illness.

689
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,599
But the one inside
is not my real master.

690
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,760
So?

691
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,560
If we don't treat him

692
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,119
like we will to His Highness,

693
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,760
people here will find out

694
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,520
sooner or later.

695
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,439
You're right, Miss Huan.

696
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,119
Sir.

697
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,359
Two guards reported

698
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,119
that the Prince Ju is out
for a military exercise today

699
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,119
and will be visiting His Highness

700
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,760
as well as spending a night here.

701
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,680
Their carriage is approaching.

702
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,160
Hurry up, open the main gate
of the temp residence

703
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:17,479
and prepare to welcome the Prince Ju.

704
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,280
Noted.

705
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,319
Miss Huan.

706
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:21,880
Regardless of Prince Ju's reason,

707
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,119
we cannot let him stay here.

708
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:23,920
If he finds out

709
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,040
that the one inside is just a decoy,

710
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,959
His Highness will be accused 
of deceiving His Lordship.

711
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,079
I know.

712
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,239
I will buy some time
from the Prince Ju.

713
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,079
Ask the decoy to feign sickness.

714
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,560
It should buy us more time.

715
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,000
Noted.

716
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,719
Also, sound a warning arrow

717
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:37,599
and inform Chancellor Ren.

718
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,560
He accompanies the Princes
into the military exercise lately.

719
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,719
He must be nearby.

720
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:41,239
Noted.

721
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

722
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
It's been a while, Miss Huan.

723
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,560
How is Lanxi?

724
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,079
Thank you for your concern.

725
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,920
Prince Lanxi is still recuperating.

726
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,000
It's best if you visit him another day.

727
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,119
(Hot Spring Palace)
I'm already here.

728
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,319
- I want to check on my brother.
- Your Highness.

729
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,439
Otherwise, people will say

730
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,839
- that I do not respect my brother.
- Your Highness.

731
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,040
Careful, Your Highness.

732
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,359
(Hot Spring Palace)
Return and get some rest, Your Highness.

733
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:28,160
Prince Lanxi's condition is unstable.

734
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:30,280
He had a high fever this afternoon.

735
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,560
It is ill-advised to bother him now.

736
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:33,880
Unstable condition?

737
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,359
All the more reason to pay him a visit.

738
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,400
You can't.

739
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,680
He is now meditating in the silent room

740
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,599
and someone is transferring qi flow
to him for his recovery.

741
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,839
He cannot be disturbed.

742
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,319
No bother.

743
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,760
Fortunately, I have had some
martial arts training

744
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
with a few tutors lately.

745
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:50,959
I can lend him my help

746
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,119
and perhaps,

747
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:53,319
he will recover even quicker.

748
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,119
Your Highness,

749
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,880
forgive my insistence.

750
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,599
Prince Lanxi said that no one

751
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,119
is allowed to disturb him.

752
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,119
I dare not defy his order.

753
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:09,400
Don't worry.

754
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,040
If someone wishes to punish you for it,

755
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,359
I will help you out.

756
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,920
Who will Lanxi punish?

757
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

758
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,800
Why are you here?

759
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,119
I heard

760
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,804
(Yongzhou First Prince, Feng Chang)
that someone would rather travel

761
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:24,719
(Yongzhou First Prince, Feng Chang)
50 li to the temp residence

762
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:27,000
than staying in the relay station
of Mount Jing with me.

763
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,640
I have to find out what happened,
of course.

764
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,760
You lost in the military exercise

765
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,599
and now you're here to throw a tantrum?

766
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,920
I don't have time to entertain you now.

767
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,479
How is Lanxi?

768
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,599
I want to see him.

769
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,319
Show me the way.

770
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,319
Prince Lanxi is meditating 
in the silent room.

771
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,280
He is too indisposed to meet outsiders.

772
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,160
You...

773
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,119
Am I an outsider?

774
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,280
Mercy, Your Highness.

775
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:56,599
My second brother is sick.

776
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,880
As his elder brother,
I wish to visit him.

777
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,400
Do I have to go through
a lowly servant like you?

778
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,319
Your Highness, you can't go in.

779
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,479
Prince Lanxi said

780
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,599
not to let anyone in.

781
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,000
I can't defy his order.

782
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,599
Lift your face up.

783
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,520
What if

784
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,959
I insist on entering?

785
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,520
I am a loyal servant.

786
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,920
I would give my life

787
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,400
than defy Prince Lanxi's order.

788
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:31,760
Good.

789
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,239
You are indeed loyal.

790
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,079
I shall fulfill your wish then.

791
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,079
Chang.

792
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,160
Chang.

793
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:52,760
Stop.

794
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,280
I'm punishing a servant.

795
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,479
Why are you stopping me?

796
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,599
Stop.

797
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,319
My dear princes,

798
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,239
what are you two doing here

799
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,319
leaving behind the comfort
of the relay station?

800
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,839
Even if you wish to visit the Second Prince,

801
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,885
(Yongzhou Chancellor, Ren Rusong)

802
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,400
there is a protocol to follow.

803
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,400
Administering corporal punishment
to a female staff

804
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,119
is simply out of line.

805
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,319
Someone!

806
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:37,079
Yes.

807
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,160
Bring Miss Huan in.

808
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,800
Your masters are committing
a great mistake

809
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:43,119
but you, the guards,

810
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,599
did not advise them.

811
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,239
Three lashes to all of you
upon your return.

812
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:48,959
Chancellor Ren.

813
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,079
They are my guards.

814
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,400
It's out of your prerogative,
I'm afraid.

815
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,439
His Lordship gave me the duty

816
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:01,400
to teach his sons martial arts
when they were still young.

817
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:03,280
I also hold the title of Grand Tutor.

818
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,839
Now that two Princes misbehaved,

819
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:08,159
I have the right to administer a lesson.

820
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,000
Prince Chang, if you insist on
continuing your wrongdoing,

821
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,479
I'll have no choice

822
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
but to inform His Lordship.

823
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,560
Chancellor Ren is right.

824
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,159
You're too reckless, Chang.

825
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,679
Aren't you here to visit Lanxi?

826
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,959
Let's go in.

827
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,959
Father.

828
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:46,080
Prince Ju.

829
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,679
Prince Chang.

830
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:50,080
How is the Prince Lanxi?

831
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
Let us in.

832
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,320
Father, Prince Lanxi has said

833
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,520
that no one...

834
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,479
I'm his master.

835
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,959
Can't I visit him as well?

836
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,560
Father.

837
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:02,639
I...

838
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,520
(Hot Spring Palace)

839
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,159
Father.

840
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,962
(Yangxin Hall)

841
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,392
(Yangxin Hall)

842
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:27,800
Father.

843
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,719
Father.

844
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,200
(Yangxin Hall)

845
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,159
Father.

846
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:35,159
Will you truly make your son
defy his master's order?

847
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,000
The physician

848
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
said that His Highness was weak

849
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,800
and he shouldn't come into contact
with cold air when he's meditating.

850
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,879
If something were to happen...

851
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:41,520
Enough. Stop nagging.

852
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:43,120
We are all worried

853
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,360
about the Prince Lanxi.

854
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:45,800
Not necessarily everyone.

855
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,479
Some people came all the way here

856
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,600
for petty trouble.

857
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,399
It takes one to know one.

858
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,760
Your Highness.

859
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,959
Your Highness.

860
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,239
Your Highness.

861
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:14,439
Dengyun Hall is over there.

862
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,600
Have someone clean Feihong Hall for me.

863
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,639
Noted.

864
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,040
Never mind it.

865
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,399
Seeing how sick Lanxi is,

866
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:22,439
I don't want to disturb him either.

867
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
I'll just head back
to the relay station.

868
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,879
Use this to buy some

869
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,399
ginseng or velvet antler for Miss Huan.

870
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:29,199
Make sure she recovers.

871
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:33,439
Enjoy your stay, Chang.

872
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,080
I will excuse myself now.

873
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,439
Where is Lanxi?

874
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:43,760
He...

875
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,000
You won't tell me?

876
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:47,760
Fine.

877
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,239
I don't have the patience
for the answer.

878
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,080
We fooled Ju this time

879
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,239
but I might not be able to help

880
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,840
next time.

881
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,000
Your Highness, I...

882
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,320
Father.

883
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,159
Prince Chang.

884
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,800
Thank you for your help.

885
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,040
If something happens to Lanxi,

886
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,800
prepare your head.

887
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:08,120
I...

888
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,959
Father, does the Prince Chang
know everything?

889
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,919
When you shotted the warning arrow,

890
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,040
I was with Prince Chang.

891
00:37:18,879 --> 00:37:20,280
He noticed something was off.

892
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,959
If he hadn't stopped Prince Ju first,

893
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,000
I wouldn't have had the time

894
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,600
to set everything up with you.

895
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,120
Why was he so harsh towards

896
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,080
Miss Huan then?

897
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,040
How else

898
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:32,040
can he scare Prince Ju?

899
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,239
But it's Miss Huan.

900
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:37,120
As a servant,

901
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,199
you should

902
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,879
always be prepared to sacrifice
for your master.

903
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,520
I have sent someone
to summon a physician.

904
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,159
Miss Huan will be all right.

905
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:45,439
Back then,

906
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,239
Princess Yige recognized my talent.

907
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,159
Before she passed away, she asked me
to take care of the Prince Lanxi.

908
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,879
Therefore, I will protect him

909
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,439
no matter what happens.

910
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,439
Understood.

911
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,399
Hurry up

912
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,760
and inform Prince Lanxi
about what happened today.

913
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,320
Ask him to return quickly.

914
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:03,280
Noted.

915
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,600
(Observations)

916
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:34,199
"Unable to identify the decoy?"

917
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:42,719
They got me.

918
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,000
Wang Yuan!

919
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,520
Yes, Your Highness?

920
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,280
Bring me a horse.

921
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,360
Where are you going, Your Highness?

922
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,000
To the Hot Spring Palace.

923
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,399
Bring 500 guards with you too.

924
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:51,040
Your Highness,

925
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:53,360
are you worried
about the Second Prince's condition?

926
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,959
What else?

927
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:57,320
Why don't you ask His Lordship
to send him a physician?

928
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:00,120
You're right.

929
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:03,239
It's not convincing if I reveal
the farce myself.

930
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:06,520
It will be interesting if Father

931
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,760
sees it for himself.

932
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,524
(Yongzhou)

933
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:20,320
Your Lordship.

934
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,000
The Shangzhou army
that was sieging Luocheng

935
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,159
(Lord of Yongzhou)
retreated.

936
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:25,239
(Lord of Yongzhou)
Did they?

937
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,879
(Yongzhou's Eunuch, Yuan Lu)
All thanks to Yu Wuyuan and Hei Fengxi

938
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:30,479
of The Four Gentry.

939
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:34,520
I overestimated

940
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,399
Yang Jinghong.

941
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:39,760
He let two kids persuade him
into a withdrawal.

942
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:42,120
The Shangzhou merchants

943
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:45,000
just can't see beyond their business.

944
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:46,560
Your Lordship,

945
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,719
Prince Ju requests
an audience with you.

946
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,760
Let him in.

947
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,399
Greetings, Father.

948
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,719
May you live for a millennium.

949
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,159
You may get up.

950
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:58,800
Thanks, Father.

951
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:02,840
Shouldn't you be in a military exercise
outside of the city?

952
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,040
Why are you back here?

953
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,080
Chang is too easy an opponent.

954
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:07,000
It's boring.

955
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,679
Have a seat.

956
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,479
Thanks, Father.

957
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,800
If you always underestimate
your opponent,

958
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,280
it will backfire on you sooner or later.

959
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:27,840
Speak.

960
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,600
Why are you here?

961
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:35,800
Father.

962
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:40,360
You mean Lanxi...

963
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,040
I didn't say

964
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,320
Lanxi left the temp residence
on his own.

965
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,879
That would be a crime of deception.

966
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,679
I think he just didn't want to see me

967
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,040
so he ventured out.

968
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,560
You are brothers.

969
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:54,959
He couldn't avoid you deliberately

970
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:57,120
when you paid him a visit.

971
00:40:58,879 --> 00:40:59,639
How about this?

972
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,320
Today is a holiday for me.

973
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,959
If you're worried about him,

974
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,600
come with me

975
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:07,040
to the Hot Spring Palace.

976
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,800
Yes, Father.

977
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:27,622
(Yong)

978
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,199
How far are we
from the Hot Spring Palace?

979
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:48,919
Not far, Father.

980
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,919
