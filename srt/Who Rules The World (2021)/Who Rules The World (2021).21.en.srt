=Episode 21=

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,999
Congratulations, Sir.

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,160
The Sacred Jade Moon can only suppress
the blood curse temporarily.

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,400
If I want to remove it completely,

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,880
I will need the Empyrean Token.

24
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,199
I have been
making preparations to rebuild

25
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,400
the Locust army in secret.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,120
Now that
you've acquired the divine skill,

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,439
will we

28
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,800
be leaving?

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,479
Why?

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,320
I want to see

31
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,320
how Feng Lanxi solves this.

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,959
I guess we'll be staying here
for a while longer.

33
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,959
It would be good
if we could use this opportunity

34
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,320
to get rid of him.

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,801
Not only are you
a great warrior, Miss Feng,

36
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,320
but you're also a great detective.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,041
Everything I do is worth it

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,520
if it earns your compliment.

39
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
However,

40
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:33,920
we still can't find the thieves.

41
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:36,200
There's something I find curious.

42
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:37,721
While they were operating,

43
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:39,200
they would need the help of machines.

44
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:40,721
But they couldn't

45
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,200
bring the machines back into the city.

46
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:45,280
Security in Yongzhou is tight.

47
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,001
If they were transported
back into the city,

48
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:48,401
how could no one notice it?

49
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:55,440
It will be difficult during normal days.

50
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,401
But it's possible during festivities.

51
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,561
During New Year festivities,

52
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:00,921
troupes from different cities
will come to perform.

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,401
The troupes will bring their costumes

54
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:05,160
and the equipment needed
to set up the stage.

55
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,401
They could have easily
hidden the machines among the items.

56
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,160
There are more than
a dozen of troupes in the city.

57
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:13,121
Where do we even start?

58
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:14,800
That's easy.

59
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,121
Thieves who steal
from the royal treasury

60
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,440
must be troupe members who know.

61
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:20,240
First of all,

62
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
a troupe is a small group.

63
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:22,481
Secondly,

64
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,201
the troupe could just be a front.

65
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:26,041
It can't be a renowned troupe.

66
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:27,440
On top of that,

67
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,041
for them to better operate,

68
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:30,600
they will not stay in an inn.

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,440
They will probably live
in a remote courtyard.

70
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:34,160
With the scope narrowed,

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,201
it should be easier for us
to track them down.

72
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Normally,

73
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,761
the troupes will leave

74
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,041
after the Lantern Festival.

75
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:41,880
To prevent suspicion,

76
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,960
they must still be inside the city.

77
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,841
The money from the treasury can't
be spent in the capital of Yongzhou.

78
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,360
It's likely the money
is still with the thieves.

79
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:49,360
If we can find the money,

80
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,841
we can prove them guilty.

81
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:51,481
That's right!

82
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:57,720
Is there anything you want to say?

83
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,520
No.

84
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,561
You two have said
everything I could have said.

85
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,440
My men will investigate

86
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,880
and find the troupe.

87
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:11,841
We shall leave it to you, Your Highness.

88
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:13,880
So, today...

89
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,201
We leave that to you.

90
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,880
Qiwu,

91
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,121
I've heard stories

92
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,681
of you leading 30,000 soldiers

93
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:21,921
against an army
many times bigger at Mount Tong.

94
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:23,041
I'm deeply impressed.

95
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:24,440
If you have the time today,

96
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,720
could you tell me more?

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,041
If you're willing to listen,

98
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,240
I'll be glad to tell.

99
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,001
I've heard great tales

100
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,121
about your feats in
the martial arts world.

101
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,921
We could talk about it in my study.

102
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,080
Let's go.

103
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,761
Tell me everything about it.

104
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:39,681
Sure.

105
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,561
I feel like the third wheel.

106
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,561
Your Highness.

107
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,121
I want the Fountain Abode

108
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:52,440
to start investigating
the troupes in the capital.

109
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:53,481
Understood.

110
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:58,841
Where are you going, Your Highness?

111
00:04:59,001 --> 00:04:59,760
Should I go with you?

112
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,561
I want some time alone
to figure out the case!

113
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,121
This jade hairpin is beautiful.

114
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,121
It looks great on you.

115
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:14,960
Qiwu,

116
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,920
take this as a gift.

117
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:18,040
A fair gift for the fair lady.
I'm giving it to you.

118
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:20,800
I shall gladly accept it.

119
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:23,200
I can't accept it
without giving you a gift too.

120
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:24,561
Pick a hairpin, Miss Feng.

121
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:26,080
Very well.

122
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,640
How about this hairpin?

123
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,240
A hairpin made from Tung wood is rare.

124
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:33,760
You picked well.

125
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:35,681
That means we both have good taste.

126
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,761
(Accessories)

127
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,561
Is something the matter?

128
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:46,040
I find it funny

129
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,601
because a black foxy
has been following us.

130
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:51,920
Sir, how much for these?

131
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,601
Ten wen.

132
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,441
Here. Thank you.

133
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:55,920
Let's go.

134
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:05,001
Hurry.

135
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:05,601
Let's go.

136
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:14,681
Qiwu, what are they doing?

137
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,601
This is the Magpie Bridge Dance.

138
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,881
Many stories

139
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,480
of the love novels in Yongzhou

140
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,200
are based on this dance.

141
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,360
How interesting.

142
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,080
Let's forget it.

143
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:26,920
Qiwu.

144
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,561
You said you envied me.

145
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,561
If you do,

146
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,721
be brave and give it a try.

147
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:33,200
Life is ever so short.

148
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,960
Come with me.

149
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:35,121
Sir!

150
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:37,281
Ladies.

151
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:37,881
Put it on.

152
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:41,200
Done.

153
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,561
Done.

154
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:42,161
Great!

155
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:44,441
Great.

156
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:46,281
Let's go.

157
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:51,001
Qiwu!

158
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:51,800
Qiwu!

159
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,520
Great!

160
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:04,681
Yes!

161
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,640
Great!

162
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:11,240
Sir.

163
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:14,240
What are you doing here?

164
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:15,520
I was worried.

165
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,601
Since you're already here,

166
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,561
why are you sneaking around
to follow them?

167
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,321
I said I wouldn't come here,

168
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,920
but I came here anyway.

169
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,681
Why would I embarrass myself?

170
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,321
The male protagonists in novels

171
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,441
always lay down their pride.

172
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:28,601
They express their thoughts

173
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:30,240
to win the lady's heart.

174
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,561
Stop reading that nonsense.

175
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:36,721
I think what you think.

176
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:38,121
Your worry is my worry.

177
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,121
Gentleman, care to
join me for the dance?

178
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
To dance with me,

179
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:05,281
you must prove your worth.

180
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:21,960
You look like someone I know.

181
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:23,960
Could that person

182
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,681
be your lover?

183
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,360
No.

184
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,841
He annoys me at every corner.

♪Yet the beauty of your eyes

♪The chaos of this land

187
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:43,121
Your words are mean,

188
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:44,960
but I sense no hostility in your tone.

189
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,121
You do not dislike that person.

190
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:50,835

194
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,601
He's still too prideful to show up.

195
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:04,881
Fengxi?

196
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,121
What did you say?

197
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:07,640
It's nothing, Qiwu.

198
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,800
Let's dance.

♪The glow in your eyes lights up my day♪

200
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,121
How thoughtful of you.

201
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,720
These are all my favorites.

202
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,521
Eat heartily.

203
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,961
Your Highness.

204
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,920
Xiao, prepare some snacks
for His Highness.

205
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,521
Never mind.

206
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,121
I'll have a pot of tea instead.

207
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,240
Yes.

208
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:41,400
Did you have fun last night?

209
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,040
What do you think?

210
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,280
How should I know?

211
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,600
My time with Miss Feng

212
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,561
was a unique experience.

213
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:53,600
I had a lot of fun.

214
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,441
By the way, I received news
from the Fountain Abode.

215
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,441
The only troupe that matches

216
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,160
is the Dafu Troupe
from the city's south side.

217
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,761
We found them, so we should investigate.

218
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,600
If they are the thieves,
they will be ready for us.

219
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,641
It wouldn't be easy.

220
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:10,641
The solution is simple.

221
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,881
We will pay them a visit
and investigate.

222
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:14,360
I have a plan.

223
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:16,840
Black Foxy, I need your help.

224
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:19,160
Me?

225
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:27,121
(Snow White Melody)

226
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,360
Is this the Dafu Troupe?

227
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,001
Yes.

228
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:32,561
How may I help you?

229
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,520
We come here to learn some skills.

230
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,560
You did it on purpose.

231
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,280
Of course.

232
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,079
You made me dress up as a dancer.

233
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,079
This is easier than that.

234
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,680
Why are you so resentful?

235
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,160
What if I couldn't sing?

236
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,079
Mr. Lanxi,

237
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,959
there is nothing you can't pull off.

238
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,079
Hurry up.

239
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,120
Raise your hand a little more.

240
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,079
Wait.

241
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Let's do it here.

242
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,240
Sir, if you will.

243
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,759
Could I borrow your fan?

244
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:38,439
The weather is ever
so sunny and pleasant.

245
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:50,120
The spring breeze carries
the fragrance of blooming blossoms.

246
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:52,000
And...

247
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Well done.

248
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,600
Great.

249
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,920
You are indeed a great singer.

250
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:20,839
May I know your name, young man?

251
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,519
My name is Mu Feng.
This is my maid, Xi.

252
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,680
Very well.

253
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,240
I agree to take you into my troupe.

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,839
However, you may only stay
while we are in the capital of Yongzhou.

255
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,560
After the Lantern Festival,

256
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,839
you two must leave

257
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:38,199
after getting your payment.

258
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,160
How does that sound?

259
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,199
Thank you.

260
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,319
Miss, can you sing too?

261
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,160
I can't.

262
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,399
My job is to take care of Young Master.

263
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,120
Very well. You shall do the chores.

264
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,040
Cui Hong.

265
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,480
Take Miss with you
and clean up the backyard.

266
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,360
Yes.

267
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:10,800
Miss.

268
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
See you later, Sir.

269
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,399
Si.

270
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,000
Get Mr.Mu A basin of water

271
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,600
so he may clean up.

272
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,879
Thank you, Mr. Li.

273
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,160
Mr. Mu.

274
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,079
Mr. Mu, this way.

275
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:28,279
He can really sing.

276
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:28,959
I know, right?

277
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,279
Brother.

278
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,639
Why did you agree to let them stay?

279
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,040
We are playing a troupe.

280
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,600
It's best to be more convincing.

281
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,040
If he really is an actor,

282
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
he could provide us with some cover.

283
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680
If our operation is compromised,

284
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,000
we can use them as our scapegoats.

285
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,639
What if they are
undercover agents of the court?

286
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,800
That's even better.

287
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,519
This place shall be their grave.

288
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,920
Thief! Thief!

289
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,440
Help! Get the thief!

290
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:44,200
Hurry up!

291
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
Come here now!

292
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,920
What is it?

293
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,800
There is a thief!

294
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
- A thief?
- A thief?

295
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,479
Where is the maid of Mr.Mu?

296
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:51,719
Isn't she living with you?

297
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,680
We came out as soon as
we heard Mr. Li shouting.

298
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,719
The maid

299
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,119
had already left the room.

300
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:56,719
That's right.

301
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:58,920
Where is Mr. Mu?

302
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,080
Follow me.

303
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,400
Mr. Li, what's wrong?

304
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,200
Mr. Mu.

305
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,839
There was a commotion outside.

306
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
Why didn't you go out and have a look?

307
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,960
A commotion?

308
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,280
Perhaps I was
too immersed in the script.

309
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,119
My room is far from the others.

310
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,080
I didn't hear it.

311
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,719
Mr. Mu,

312
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,200
where is your maid?

313
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,280
I don't know.

314
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,400
Liar.

315
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,200
When someone's maid is missing,

316
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,719
their first reaction is to ask
about the maid's safety,

317
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,400
not deny knowing anything.

318
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,800
Come clean, where is she?

319
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,320
Brother, she is right here.

320
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,160
Come clean.

321
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:05,359
Who are you?

322
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,239
Are you not going
to tell them the truth?

323
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:11,560
Mr. Li.

324
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,440
Actually...

325
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,119
Actually,

326
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,719
he's not my master.

327
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,280
He's my husband.

328
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,639
Your husband?

329
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,200
Why do you lie about
being master and servant?

330
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,479
We eloped.

331
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:29,280
I am Li Yulan from
the Li family of Suicheng.

332
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,320
My husband was in the Qingyan Troupe.

333
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:36,160
We fell in love.

334
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,200
My father didn't approve of our love.

335
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,200
So, we could only elope.

336
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,879
But,

337
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,839
we are worried my father might find us.

338
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,160
We had no choice but to lie about
being master and servant.

339
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,719
Mr. Li.

340
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,960
My husband and I are grateful

341
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
that you take us in.

342
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,960
It's just that

343
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,400
I missed my husband so terribly.

344
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,400
That's why I came to him.

345
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,560
I'm sorry for the trouble.

346
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,479
Are you Shang Yunhai?

347
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,920
Dear, he knows your true identity.

348
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:10,479
You know him?

349
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,160
The Qingyan Troupe is famous.

350
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,560
The actor Shang Yunhai
is even more famous.

351
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,800
Of course, I know.

352
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,960
Over a month ago,

353
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,119
Mr. Shang eloped

354
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,800
with a young lady from Suicheng.

355
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,200
I didn't expect to meet them here.

356
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:23,719
It's such an honor.

357
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,479
We had no choice

358
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,200
but to lie about our identities.

359
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:30,280
Please forgive us.

360
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,800
I see.

361
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,560
It's all just a misunderstanding.

362
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,960
Mu...

363
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,400
Mr. Shang,

364
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,239
there was a thief in the yard.

365
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,359
That was why I brought everyone here.

366
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:47,479
As it turns out,

367
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,200
we're interrupting.

368
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,239
My apologies.

369
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,759
We'll get out of your hair.

370
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,119
Goodbye.

371
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,519
How do you know

372
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,759
about Shang Yunhai and Miss Li?

373
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,960
I met them on my way to Mount Wu.

374
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,440
I helped them.

375
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,519
You really are a nosy person.

376
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,440
All you care about are the greater good

377
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,160
and the world's fate.

378
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
The fate of my world

379
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:29,920
is connected to the trouble

380
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,680
people run into.

381
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,280
I checked all the rooms.

382
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,320
I didn't find the stolen money.

383
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,080
We alerted them.

384
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,920
Let's continue tomorrow.

385
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,040
Stay here for the night.

386
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,119
We must avoid suspicion.

387
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,800
You can have the bed.

388
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,440
I'll sleep on the floor.

389
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,960
Husband.

390
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,479
You must be starving.

391
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:18,800
I can do it.

392
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,920
Are you really in love with Mr. Shang?

393
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,239
Of course.

394
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:43,800
If you love him,

395
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,359
you shouldn't have eloped with him.

396
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,960
Mr. Shang clearly belongs on stage.

397
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,280
His potential is wasted

398
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,759
when he's with you.

399
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
A great actor

400
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,160
can't go without acting.

401
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,999
His acting career comes first.

402
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,160
You should know as much, Miss Li.

403
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,239
Is your love more important
than his future?

404
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:10,839
I disagree with what you say.

405
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,239
Before I met her,

406
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,999
acting was my top priority.

407
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:15,999
After I met her,

408
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,160
I realized

409
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,960
how much I was missing out on.

410
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,359
My view of the world

411
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,920
could be wider.

412
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:25,280
Mr. Shang,

413
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:27,200
do not be blinded

414
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,560
by mere love.

415
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,200
Life is

416
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,719
a series of decisions.

417
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,280
I had to make sacrifices either way.

418
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,160
I would have regret either way.

419
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,479
However,

420
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,440
I don't want her to be my regret.

421
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,239
Think it through, Mr. Shang.

422
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,920
Do not let your potentials go to waste.

423
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,680
You'd be covered in dust

424
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:56,239
like a rundown house.

425
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
About what you said,

426
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,719
was it true?

427
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:13,960
It was to fool him.

428
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,040
Don't take it to heart.

429
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:18,639
Black Foxy,

430
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,119
I think I know where
the stolen money is kept.

431
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:38,560
Just as I suspected.

432
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:40,759
What do we do now?

433
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,280
Inform Zhong Li to make the arrest.

434
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,440
Your Highness and
Miss Feng are impressive.

435
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,280
You caught the thieves
in such a short time.

436
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,040
But, how did you find out?

437
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,759
I'll explain.

438
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,239
It was a dark and windy night.

439
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,800
- We infiltrated...
- Your Highness.

440
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,400
Your Highness.

441
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,359
I'll explain later.

442
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,479
The thieves had matched
their statements beforehand.

443
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,560
We can't learn anything.

444
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,920
According to the Ministry of Justice,

445
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,440
it seems Prince Ju

446
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,519
has enough evidence

447
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,239
to convict Vice Minister Zhou.

448
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,400
It's likely Prince Ju will report it

449
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:13,560
to His Lordship
during tomorrow's court meeting.

450
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,359
We found the stolen money

451
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,839
but not the ledger.

452
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,440
They managed to break into the treasury,

453
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,119
which means they had help on the inside.

454
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,839
We must get the information out of them

455
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,839
before tomorrow

456
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,639
and find the mole.

457
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,119
Then, we look for the ledger.

458
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:30,719
They made up their statements.

459
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:33,999
Further interrogation
will be a waste of time.

460
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,440
I have an idea.

461
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,759
Who are you?

462
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,800
We may have stolen
from the royal treasury,

463
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,960
but only the Ministry of Justice
can punish us.

464
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,519
This is an abuse of power!

465
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:47,839
You're right.

466
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,040
We don't work
for the Ministry of Justice.

467
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,040
We are going to abuse our power.

468
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,519
What can you do about it?

469
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,160
You...

470
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,320
You are in no place to speak.

471
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:56,719
Bring her in.

472
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:57,280
Yes.

473
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:02,800
Tell me,

474
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:05,200
who is the mole
in the Ministry of Revenue?

475
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,119
I don't know.

476
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,999
That'd better be true.

477
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,359
I don't plan to interrogate.

478
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:12,519
Get her out of here.

479
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:17,119
What do you want with her?

480
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,080
What are you going to do?

481
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,680
You can't lynch her!

482
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,359
Calm down.

483
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:25,839
It'll be your turn soon.

484
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,920
She doesn't know anything!

485
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,639
You can't do this!
Lynching is not right!

486
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,879
Continue the interrogation.

487
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,239
If she refuses to tell us,

488
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,519
execute her right here.

489
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,320
Well?

490
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,320
I don't know.

491
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
I know nothing.

492
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:43,839
Get him out of here.

493
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:45,119
I know nothing at all!

494
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,800
Brother!

495
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,440
He doesn't know anything!

496
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,879
He knows nothing.

497
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,400
Er! He doesn't know anything!

498
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,160
Next.

499
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,080
I'll tell you everything.

500
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,639
I'll tell you.

501
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,560
The mole

502
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,839
was Chamberlain Li
of the finance department.

503
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,639
Have mercy on me.

504
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,160
Have mercy on me.

505
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:15,999
Have mercy on me.

506
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:16,999
Have mercy on me.

507
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,359
He gave in already?

508
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,160
What's wrong?

509
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,160
Mr. Li, you looked shocked.

510
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,519
Don't you know

511
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:26,160
voice can be mimicked?

512
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,719
Lock them up.

513
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:41,639
Zhong Li, have Chuanyu arrest the mole.

514
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,359
Yes.

515
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,280
Take them to their cells.

516
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,160
Yes.

517
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,599
Easily done.

518
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,999
The case has been solved.

519
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,800
Minister Feng,
you have nothing more to worry about.

520
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,479
Much obliged, Your Highness.

521
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,800
It's time for me to go back.

522
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,519
Don't worry.

523
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,560
I'll visit you again. Wait for me.

524
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,080
Sure.

525
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,320
Show some concern for His Highness.

526
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,920
He's doing just fine.

527
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,040
See you.

528
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,639
Miss Fengxi is such a peculiar person.

529
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,320
Her actions are unorthodox.

530
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
She is ruthless,

531
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,119
even more so than men.

532
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,999
Despite her lack of manners,

533
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,719
I can't help but feel
impressed and envious.

534
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,759
Perhaps she is truly

535
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,719
one of a kind.

536
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,440
Your Highness.

537
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,280
We caught the mole

538
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,560
and learned the truth from him.

539
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,999
We arrived before he could

540
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,280
destroy the ledger.

541
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,960
We can prove
Vice Minister Zhou's innocence.

542
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,759
Send the evidence to Minster Feng.

543
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,239
She must tell my father
during tomorrow's court meeting.

544
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:27,719
Yes.

545
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,599
Hold on.

546
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,759
You mentioned

547
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,080
you had read a lot of romance novels.

548
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,960
How do they do it?

549
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,879
How do they do what?

550
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,440
Well...

551
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,359
Expressing their thoughts.

552
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:56,280
Are you going to express your thoughts

553
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,400
to Miss Fengxi?

554
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,879
Just tell me.

555
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,680
I'm confident to say

556
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,999
I know the novels published
in the Dadong Empire

557
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,119
like the back of my hand.

558
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:09,359
Whether scholar and fair lady,
or hero and beauty,

559
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,119
I know all of the stories.

560
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,560
When it comes to
expressing your thoughts,

561
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:15,920
there are standards to meet.

562
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,479
When a man expresses his love

563
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,800
for a woman,

564
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:21,200
there are three requirements to meet.

565
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,519
The mood, the words, and the gift.

566
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,160
The mood, the words,

567
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:29,239
and the gift.

568
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,999
Is it similar to war?

569
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,560
The time, place, and people
must work as one.

570
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:39,359
It's not wrong
to understand it that way.

571
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:41,519
Expressing love

572
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:44,239
is not as simple as fighting a war.

573
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:47,839
There are two kinds of moods.

574
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,920
The first kind,

575
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,719
special occasions.

576
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:53,320
The Double Seventh Festival
and the Lantern Festival.

577
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,040
And the special atmosphere,

578
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,639
such as the first snow
or a trip to the lake in summer.

579
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,960
Anyway, use the special occasions

580
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,400
to let the special someone
feel relaxed and pleasant.

581
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,440
Using the opportunity
to express your love

582
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:09,760
will increase
the success rate by a third.

583
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,039
This is the same as
setting up an ambush.

584
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:15,279
We set up an ambush
at a spot that seems harmless.

585
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,480
We catch the enemies off-guard.

586
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,920
We strike when they let their guard down,

587
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,240
taking them down in one strike.

588
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,440
I am impressed

589
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,920
by your ability to comprehend.

590
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,240
Your Highness

591
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,200
understands how mood
and atmosphere work,

592
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,400
so let's move on to the second element.

593
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:35,760
The romantic words.

594
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,400
The romantic words
must be told the right way.

595
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,279
If you go in headstrong,

596
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,960
she will turn you down,

597
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,480
and even view you as a fool.

598
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,039
If you make it too fancy,

599
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:53,559
she will see you as a womanizer.

600
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,319
So,

601
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,680
what you say must be true and honest.

602
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,000
It must be powerful

603
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,720
so it's both pleasant
and touching to hear.

604
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,720
Judging by your face,

605
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,359
you don't get it?

606
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,839
How hard can it be?

607
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,319
The romantic words are the main force.

608
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:24,039
It must be used in the right place.

609
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,520
A battle on the mountain pass

610
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,359
should be fought with blades.

611
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,000
To surround the enemies,

612
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,440
we deploy the archers.

613
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,359
You got it right once again.

614
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,879
With the right atmosphere

615
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,359
and the right words,

616
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,520
your rate of successfully winning
her heart is already 80 percent.

617
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,760
For the last 20 percent,

618
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:48,200
you need an external force.

619
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,319
It's known as a love token.

620
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,839
The love token

621
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,559
is usually a hairpin.

622
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:57,799
"The best gift I have for you
is a hairpin of jade and pearl."

623
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,799
That's how it works.

624
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,520
Of course.

625
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,920
We recruit the enemy general
after the battle.

626
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,559
We promise them rewards
and earn their loyalty.

627
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,400
Expressing one's love isn't that hard.

628
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,240
Your Highness, perhaps it's best
to give up on this thought.

629
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,920
All you think about

630
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,039
are war and bloodshed.

631
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,720
It's not the same as dealing with love.

632
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,520
It boils down to one concept,

633
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:28,680
"dream-like."

634
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,039
I know.

635
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,720
It's not the dream
about glory and victories,

636
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,760
but rather the dream one has after sunset.

637
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,160
You must make sure
you get everything right.

638
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,400
Get up.

639
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,359
Your worry is unnecessary.

640
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,039
I am a prince of Yongzhou,

641
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,520
I know what must be done.

642
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:54,720
But you,

643
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,319
you spend your time

644
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,879
reading novels

645
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,920
instead of proper books of knowledge.

646
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,680
Copy the whole book
of Strategies of the Warring States.

647
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,079
But...

648
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,319
This is...

649
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,920
You are being ungrateful!

650
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,799
You used me and discarded me!

651
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,879
So what?

652
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,559
I am the prince, not you.

653
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,039
Long live the Lord!

654
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,039
At ease.

655
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,839
Yes, Your Lordship.

656
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,839
Present your reports,

657
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,879
or the court shall be dismissed.

658
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,559
I have a report for Your Lordship.

659
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,039
I was told you had been attacked

660
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,240
a few days ago.

661
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,279
Are you well today?

662
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,839
My wounds have healed.
Thank Your Lordship for your concern.

663
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,559
My report is about

664
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,799
the attack from the other day.

665
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,559
I was attacked

666
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:57,240
because of my investigation

667
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,559
of the stolen money from our treasury.

668
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,440
Minister Feng.

669
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:03,400
The theft is connected
to the corruption scandal.

670
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,760
My father tasked me
with the investigation.

671
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:08,279
Why are you interfering, Minster Feng?

672
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,760
I wouldn't dare compete with Prince Ju,

673
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:13,000
but this matter
concerns Vice Minister Zhou.

674
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,720
As we all know,

675
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,039
Vice Minister Zhou
is my cousin's husband.

676
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,799
I couldn't turn down

677
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:20,200
my cousin's request.

678
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,559
I could only investigate secretly

679
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,039
and find the truth before
reporting to Your Lordship.

680
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
Is it a secret investigation

681
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:29,319
or an attempt
to absolve Vice Minister Zhou?

682
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,039
I wouldn't dare.

683
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,440
I'm willing to be punished
for investigating

684
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,240
without permission.

685
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,920
But please, allow me
to finish my report.

686
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,720
Father.

687
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,559
Perhaps Minister Feng has other motives.

688
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,720
As an official,

689
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:45,000
national affairs are the priority.

690
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,039
If it's not for her personal agenda,

691
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,799
then her conscience is clear.

692
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,440
Speak away, Minister Feng.

693
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,760
Understood.

694
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,400
After my secret investigation,

695
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,200
the official

696
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,319
who allowed the royal treasury
to be robbed wasn't Vice Minister Zhou.

697
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,960
It was Chamberlain Li Mu
of the finance department.

698
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,839
Can you prove this claim?

699
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,279
I have the evidence,

700
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,559
and I've captured the culprit.

701
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:12,400
The lost money and ledger
have been retrieved.

702
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,279
To prevent Li Mu from escaping,

703
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,839
I've imprisoned him in my home.

704
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,799
Li Mu plead guilty

705
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,200
that he and the three corrupt officials
arrested by Prince Ju

706
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
are accomplices.

707
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,760
They framed Vice Minister Zhou
to absolve themselves.

708
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,559
You retrieved the stolen money?

709
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,559
The money is outside the hall.

710
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,359
Minister Feng,

711
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,720
it's clear you want
to absolve Zhou Zhong of his crime

712
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,480
by presenting the spoils

713
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,559
and a scapegoat.

714
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,879
Prince Ju, I would never do that

715
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:41,879
in a million years.

716
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:43,839
Your Lordship.

717
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,520
I have the statement

718
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,039
and evidence of Li Mu conspiring

719
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:48,799
with the thieves.

720
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,440
Please have a look.

721
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,359
Minister Feng managed to retrieve

722
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
the stolen money
in such a short amount of time.

723
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,879
This is a great feat.

724
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,440
However, she investigated

725
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,799
without my permission.

726
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,039
Your merit is canceled out
by your mistake.

727
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:25,160
Heed my order.

728
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,760
Minister Feng and Prince Feng Ju
shall both investigate

729
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,039
the corruption of
the Ministry of Revenue.

730
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,760
Yes, Your Lordship.

731
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:34,319
Yes, Your Lordship.

732
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,240
Sir.

733
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:39,359
News from our scout.

734
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,839
After the court meeting,

735
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,480
Feng Ju came rushing to our location.

736
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,960
He will arrive

737
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:45,960
in about ten minutes.

738
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,319
It seems Feng Lanxi solved the case.

739
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,559
Prince Ju

740
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,559
must be greatly frustrated.

741
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,240
He must think I am nothing more

742
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,440
than a pretentious fraud.

743
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,000
Is Feng Lanxi really so talented?

744
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,680
Did he see through your strategy?

745
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,200
He alone is two of the Four Gentry.

746
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,920
He built the famous Fountain Abode

747
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,920
all by himself.

748
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,559
Of course he's capable.

749
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,960
However, he didn't see through my plan.

750
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,039
He fell right into it.

751
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
You let them catch the thieves.

752
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,119
But you promised Feng Ju

753
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,599
you would help him
bring down Feng Lanxi.

754
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,680
Feng Lanxi is cunning.

755
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,680
He wouldn't let his guard down

756
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,680
unless he won a round.

757
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,359
The theft

758
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,279
was a decoy.

759
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,440
My true goal

760
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:37,039
is to eliminate him

761
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,639
and destroy the Fountain Abode.

762
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,480
I'll make Feng Lanxi

763
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,599
lose the right to fight
for the rule over this land.

764
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,879
Bring him here.

765
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,280
Yes.

766
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:53,725
Please.

767
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,081
Greetings, Mr. Yu.

768
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:03,641
You look like you're in an awful mood.

769
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,721
Is something the matter, Your Highness?

770
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:07,561
Not exactly.

771
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,881
It's just that Feng Lanxi

772
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,641
saw through the trap you set up.

773
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,721
How could that be?

774
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,521
It would seem

775
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,600
I underestimated Prince Lanxi.

776
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:28,361
Do you have other plans, Mr. Yu?

777
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,641
Could it be that you are out of ideas,
Mr. Yu?

778
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:39,240
My plan failed

779
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:40,840
because I underestimated the opponent.

780
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,600
To make up for it,

781
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,120
I have decided.

782
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,040
I will help you
achieve what you desire, Your Highness.

783
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,081
What I desire?

784
00:36:58,161 --> 00:36:59,320
You mean you are willing...

785
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:05,200
Will you help me become the heir of Lord?

786
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:06,400
As matters stand,

787
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:08,721
I have no choice
but to disobey my family's rules

788
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,760
and assist Your Highness.

789
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:13,281
Good.

790
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:15,001
Wonderful!

791
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,200
This is a blessing in disguise!

792
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,480
The old saying is true!

793
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,600
I, Feng Ju, thank you, Mr. Yu.

794
00:37:24,281 --> 00:37:25,441
Since ancient times,

795
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,960
the eldest and the legitimate offspring

796
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:29,521
have always been prioritized
in the line of succession for the throne.

797
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:32,361
Prince Lanxi fulfills both

798
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,521
of those criteria.

799
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:37,001
There is only one way for you

800
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:38,801
to become the heir of Lord.

801
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,400
You must make His Lordship
become wary of Prince Lanxi.

802
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,441
His Lordship understands
the importance of balance above all.

803
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:51,600
He would never allow his heir

804
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,801
to outshine him.

805
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,161
Your Highness.

806
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,680
I will give Your Highness a sachet

807
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:02,441
that contains the methods
to use against Prince Lanxi.

808
00:38:03,321 --> 00:38:05,001
However, it can only be opened

809
00:38:05,441 --> 00:38:06,321
after he leaves the capital of Yongzhou.

810
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,441
Why?

811
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:11,481
Your Highness will know
when the time comes.

812
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:12,840
One more thing.

813
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:17,201
I will need Your Highness
to put up a performance with me.
