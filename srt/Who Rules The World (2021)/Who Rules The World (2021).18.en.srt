Ask the Astronomy Officer
to divine their birth date.

21
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,680
If nothing goes wrong,
we'll exchange the dowry and dower.

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,800
On the first day of the upcoming year,

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,319
I will grant you the betrothal decree.

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,199
Consider it a new beginning
for a new year.

25
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,440
Queen Baili's fasting

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,559
will have come to an end.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,279
Much obliged, Father.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,800
Send out my decree.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,599
Feng Chang will be given the title
of Prince Yongxin.

30
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,279
He will be granted
a fief of 3000 households.

31
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:09,759
Yes, Your Lordship.

32
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,440
Congratulations, Prince Yongxin.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,000
Is this how it feels like
to be a Prince?

34
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,399
Everyone fights among themselves

35
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,479
to get to this position.

36
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,839
Your Lordship,
you suddenly promoted Prince Chang.

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,839
Are you trying to use him
to counterbalance Prince Lanxi?

38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,600
Either way,

39
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,360
Lanxi has had his shares
of attention lately.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,720
I still can afford the price of
promoting someone to a Prince.

41
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,320
This should at least wake up those

42
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,440
opportunistic ministers.

43
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,119
I still haven't decided who will
be the heir yet.

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,960
Wise decision, Your Lordship.

45
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,320
Ask the Ministry of Works

46
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,279
to forge more armors and weapons

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,839
during this winter break.

48
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,199
Yes, Your Lordship.

49
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,919
Father gave Feng Chang the title
of Prince Yongxin?

50
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,479
Calm down, Your Highness.

51
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:26,880
Someone!

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,639
Yes, Your Highness?

53
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,039
Fetch a message to my mother.

54
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,720
Tell her it's ready to be deployed.

55
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:37,679
Yes, Your Highness.

56
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,520
Li Jiaxian.

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,039
Yes, Your Highness?

58
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,479
Your Highness, this is...

59
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,240
You would defy my order?

60
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:53,360
No,

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,960
Your Highness, this is a serious matter.

62
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,600
It might...

63
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,399
So?

64
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,600
I can kill many birds with one stone.

65
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,119
Inform my uncle

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,559
about it.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,919
Yes, Your Highness.

68
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:08,839
Your Highness,

69
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,000
is it wise to leave your mother 
out of this?

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,199
Mother is now confined to her palace.

71
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,520
Even if we tell her,

72
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,240
she won't be able to help us.

73
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,359
On the contrary,

74
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,760
she might just cause more trouble.

75
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,320
Go now.

76
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,959
Yes, Your Highness.

77
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,240
(Younger Brother of Queen Baili, Baili Jing)

78
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,200
It is the Queen's order.

79
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,920
Did you hear everything clearly,
Your Highness?

80
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:25,239
These are truly her words?

81
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,679
Just admire the plum blossom tomorrow
with Miss Qi Cheng.

82
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,320
No need

83
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,040
to worry about the rest, Your Highness.

84
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,839
Remind her

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,920
of what she promised me.

86
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,839
I'm only helping her this one time.

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,480
After tomorrow,

88
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,760
we don't owe each other anything.

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,799
Did you just say

90
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,359
that Feng Chang invited me
to admire plum blossom?

91
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,125
(Everlasting Virtues)

92
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,799
Yes.

93
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,720
Oh, Your Highness.

94
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,040
In your opinion,

95
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,480
doesn't this sudden invitation

96
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,359
raise suspicion?

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,559
It doesn't sound like
what Feng Chang normally does.

98
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,426
(Prince Yongping's Residence)
Baili Jing went to visit Feng Chang

99
00:06:28,427 --> 00:06:29,359
(Prince Yongping's Residence)
in plain clothing?

100
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,440
Carry on with the espionage.

101
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,160
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:35,688
(Prince Yongping's Residence)

103
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,559
You scum!

104
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,119
Prince Yongping, you're scum!

105
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,959
You destroyed my family.

106
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,239
I'll kill you. Let go of me!

107
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,440
Your Highness, black hound blood.

108
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
I'll kill you.

109
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,880
I'll kill you, scum!

110
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,239
Let go of me!

111
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,880
You scum.

112
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,239
Let go!

113
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,000
Scum.

114
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:03,839
Don't worry.

115
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,119
I will come after you.

116
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,079
I will kill you. Let me go now!

117
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,720
(I hope the black hound blood)

118
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,559
(will deter you from heading out today.)

119
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,559
Who set the madman loose?

120
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,480
How dare he sullied Your Highness
with black hound blood?

121
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,359
Disgusting.

122
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,200
Your Highness,

123
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,880
the investigation has been completed.

124
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,320
He was a merchant

125
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,720
who colluded with Wang Minghai.

126
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,559
When Wang Minghai was arrested,

127
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,399
so did he due to bribery.

128
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,519
That's why he holds grudges against you.

129
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,119
Hand him over
to the Capital City Governor.

130
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,519
Double the amount of patrols
outside of the residence.

131
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,760
Yes, Your Highness.

132
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,000
I have

133
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,040
to pay Minister Liu a visit later.

134
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,000
Noted.

135
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:47,959
Wait, no.

136
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,320
You have been defiled
by black hound blood.

137
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,519
Usually, you need to stay home
for a few days.

138
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,679
Then fast and rinse
the filth away with salt.

139
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,760
Otherwise,
bad luck will descend upon you.

140
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,799
I confirm the existence
of such superstition.

141
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,519
New Year is around the corner.

142
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,279
Having a good start is very important.

143
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,320
Or else...

144
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,440
Your Highness, you shouldn't...

145
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,239
Enough with the dos and don'ts.

146
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,040
They are just baseless superstitions.

147
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,640
If my enemy pours me

148
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,559
black hound blood on the battlefield,

149
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,880
do I have to get on my knee
and pray right away?

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Chuanyun, did your brain
stop working just now?

151
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,000
I...

152
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,200
Why would you stop His Highness?

153
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,479
He's not looking for Minister Liu.

154
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,119
He's just using it as an excuse

155
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,359
to look for Miss Feng.

156
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,159
Oh, it didn't come across my mind.

157
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,239
You...

158
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,119
His Highness is head over heels
for Miss Feng.

159
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,599
(Miss Feng?)

160
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Black hound blood?

161
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,640
Right?

162
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,520
I can still

163
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,200
smell the stench now.

164
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,440
Why are you laughing?

165
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,799
You are so calm and collected normally

166
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,919
but when it comes to this,
you have the reaction of a normal person.

167
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,119
Are you taking pleasures
in my misfortune?

168
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,599
I have a solution.

169
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,960
Come with me.

170
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,613
(Southern Market)

171
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,000
What solution is this?

172
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,919
Can't you smell it?

173
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,280
It smells so good.

174
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,239
I can guarantee you

175
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,799
that after you have this meal,

176
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,679
whatever animal blood stench on you

177
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,640
will disappear.

178
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,479
Only the fragrance
of western spice and meat

179
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
will be left.

180
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,640
Don't leave me. Listen.

181
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,679
This spice came from the West.

182
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,640
It's usually for a ritual

183
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,799
and it can dispel the bad luck
brought by the black hound blood.

184
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:56,679
Believe me.

185
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,280
I have traveled for many years

186
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,719
so I have seen many tricks.

187
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,919
Foreign wisdom is still wisdom.

188
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,880
Understood?

189
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:08,239
Your dish is here.

190
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,719
Enjoy the meal.

191
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,559
What is this?

192
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,760
The middle section of the chicken feet.

193
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,520
It's crunchy and delicious.

194
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,280
Are you sure it's edible?

195
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,719
Edible and delectable.

196
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,159
Try it.

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,760
Bad luck begone.

198
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,479
Black hound blood?

199
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:01,159
What do you think?

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,039
Do you feel...?

201
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,239
That's it.

202
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,039
That's what it tastes like
in your mouth.

203
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:09,599
It's normal.

204
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,359
Come.

205
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,520
Rinse your palate.

206
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,640
Now, savor it.

207
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,039
The taste is nothing special.

208
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,400
A gentry like you lives

209
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,359
on the high horse all the time.

210
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,280
You're sick of exotic delicacies

211
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,159
but little do you know
that the true exotic delicacies

212
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,280
hide in small alleys like this.

213
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,080
It's a shame that none of you

214
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,840
knows how to appreciate food.

215
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
How can you be this petty?

216
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:43,960
Didn't you say

217
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,640
that you would get rid of the bad luck
brought by the black hound blood?

218
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,599
Yes.

219
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,799
But I'm with you now.

220
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,159
I need to make sure
I didn't get any the bad luck too.

221
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,479
I'll have all of them then.

222
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,599
Your meat buns.

223
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,039
Meat buns!

224
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,479
- The best meat buns in town.
- Mister.

225
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,760
Six tea eggs.

226
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,400
The tea eggs still need to be cooked
for a little while.

227
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,760
It's okay. I can wait.

228
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,400
Langhua,

229
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,840
you're not done shopping yet?

230
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,239
Embroidered fabric! Come have a look!

231
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,440
Come!

232
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,000
Does it look good on me?

233
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,080
That's a redundant question.

234
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,119
In his eyes,
you're beautiful in anything.

235
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,640
You...

236
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,520
You're exaggerating.

237
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,479
I'm telling the truth.

238
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,159
Still hungry?

239
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,320
You're full already?

240
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,919
You ate so little.

241
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:48,679
Wait for me.

242
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,559
Hide.

243
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,119
Why?

244
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:50,799
Stop right there.

245
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,320
(Mix Fruits and Date Cake)
Don't ask why. Just hide.

246
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,679
Take my candied hawthorn.

247
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,559
Don't ask. Go.

248
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:55,479
Go.

249
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,679
- Stop!
- You're mean.

250
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,679
Martial Sister.

251
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,000
Martial Sister.

252
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,159
Martial Sister.

253
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,320
-Martial Sister.
-Martial Sister.

254
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,200
Martial Sister.

255
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,159
You bought so many things.

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,559
What a coincidence.

257
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,400
Martial Sister, didn't you say

258
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,919
you couldn't understand certain parts
of the Jade Moon Chant

259
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,320
so you had to go out
to look for inspiration?

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,559
Why are...

261
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,280
Yes.

262
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,440
Old Taiyin's technique
is quite esoteric.

263
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,799
I can't understand it fully

264
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,200
so I was thinking

265
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,280
that walking around and observing

266
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,719
might give me some kind of inspiration.

267
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,520
You can get inspiration from this too?

268
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,599
Of course.

269
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,080
Why not?

270
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,880
Why else do you think I spent
such a long time looking at it then?

271
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,039
Come have a look.

272
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,440
(Mix Fruits and Date Cake)
Look at this egg.

273
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,400
Behold.

274
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,799
This egg

275
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
is as murky as the world
when it first came into being.

276
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,200
When simmered

277
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,799
with other spices and condiments,

278
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,159
this egg became

279
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,599
a dish that combines

280
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,799
the essence of meat and vegetables.

281
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,119
If you can decipher the secret within,

282
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,599
you will then overcome this ceiling

283
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:07,799
in martial arts.

284
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,840
Why are you laughing, Langhua?

285
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,760
No one's laughing.

286
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,159
I just couldn't agree more
with what you said.

287
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:18,280
You are in another league, Martial Sister.

288
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,000
Of course, I'm your martial sister.

289
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:20,719
Come.

290
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:21,679
Look at

291
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:22,719
this egg.

292
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,840
Well...

293
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,479
We should leave now.

294
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,640
We won't disrupt your perusal further.

295
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,520
Reflect upon the words I said.

296
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,400
Go.

297
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:30,239
Let's go.

298
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,080
Go.

299
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,919
Return now.

300
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,760
What did I just make up?

301
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,679
Buns!

302
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,320
Hot, steamy bun!

303
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,080
Why did you...

304
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,320
Why did you keep me hidden like that?

305
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,280
Can't I meet them properly?

306
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,119
No.

307
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,719
I just wanted to make sure
Langhua didn't find out anything.

308
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:53,559
- Why did you lie to them?
- I...

309
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,159
It's because...

310
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,880
It's because I don't want them
to get the wrong idea.

311
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,479
About what?

312
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,200
You haven't answered my question.

313
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,039
The wrong idea about what?

314
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,880
That I skipped my training

315
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,599
to study tea eggs with you here.

316
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,400
You even ate my candied hawthorn.

317
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,078
(Prince Yongping's Residence)

318
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:36,693
(Everlasting Virtues)

319
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,320
Your Highness,

320
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,000
the gift to Prince Chang
for the plum blossom festival

321
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,719
is ready.

322
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,000
Good.

323
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,200
Are you

324
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,039
truly attending the event?

325
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,000
No matter what,

326
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,479
he's my elder brother.

327
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,119
I shouldn't make things tougher
for him.

328
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:11,440
(Everlasting Virtues)

329
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,359
Nice shot, Your Highness.

330
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,559
Please.

331
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:32,359
Look how beautiful this one is.

332
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,280
Who is prettier? The flower or me?

333
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:38,320
You, of course.

334
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,640
So why the long face then?

335
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:43,960
If you don't want to see me,

336
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,840
don't force yourself.

337
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,839
Good morning, Prince Lanxi.

338
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,839
Pardon my intrusion, Official Jiang.

339

(Plum Garden Owner, Jiang Che)
It's my honor, Your Highness.

340
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,239
Your Highness,

341
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,160
Prince Ju is at the
Liangfeng Pavilion by the south.

342
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,680
If it's too cold for you,

343
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,640
you can head to Xuliu Parlor
to listen to some music.

344
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,239
The performer today

345
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,119
is the renowned Yu Guan.

346
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,439
I would hate to miss her performance.

347
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,439
Oh, is Feng Chang here?

348
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,439
Yes, he is.

349
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,599
However,

350
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,640
he's having a promenade

351
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,640
with the daughter of Duke Qi.

352
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,800
It's best

353
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,079
if you do not disturb them.

354
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,040
Here, please.

355
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,479
Good morning, Your Highness.

356
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,959
Morning, Official Baili.

357
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,439
It's been a while.

358
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,839
Mr. Liu.

359
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,000
Here, please.

360
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,280
Enjoy the spectacle, Prince Ju.

361
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,880
(Xuliu Parlor)

362
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,160
Your Highness,

363
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,160
it's getting chilly here.

364
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,800
Allow me to fetch you a charcoal pot.

365
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,280
No need.

366
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,000
Where is the person
who went to invite Prince Chang?

367
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,199
Why hasn't he returned?

368
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,239
I will see to it that it's done now.

369
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,880
Forgive me.

370
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:53,160
All right. Dismissed.

371
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:53,920
Yes, Your Highness.

372
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,319
Mister,

373
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,800
come get changed with me downstairs.

374
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,959
It's cold.

375
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,040
I...

376
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,479
Follow me.

377
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:11,640
Here, please.

378
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,800
Your Highness,
Prince Chang is getting changed.

379
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,040
He will be here soon.

380
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,479
Your servant

381
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,040
will be back once he gets changed too.

382
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:38,520
This tea was freshly brewed.
Enjoy, Your Highness.

383
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,239
Well.

384
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:13,319
Your Highness?

385
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,800
Your Highness?

386
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,160
Greetings, Prince Chang.

387
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:44,599
Miss Qi Cheng? Did you...?

388
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,959
Everything is ready.

389
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,239
Should we summon the people now?

390
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,439
(She's cold-hearted.)

391
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:52,920
Don't panic.

392
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:54,800
But...

393
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,560
Yes?

394
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,520
Sorry, Your Highness.

395
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,599
Feng Chang,

396
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,160
why would you bring harm to me?

397
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,920
(Lanxi cannot stay here.)

398
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,719
I am the eldest son.
You are the legitimate son.

399
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,800
We are meant

400
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:32,319
to be enemies.

401
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:34,479
Might as well

402
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,479
settle the score as early as possible.

403
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,239
I'm sure you are forced to do this.

404
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,280
Tell me. Who forced you, Feng Chang?

405
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:52,760
Speak now

406
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,439
and we'll figure out a solution.

407
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,199
You have lied to me for many years.

408
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,479
Do you truly view me
as your elder brother?

409
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,160
You only have yourself to blame

410
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,760
for what's coming next.

411
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,520
I never want it to be like this.

412
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,439
But in the royal family,

413
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,439
knowing more means more risks.

414
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,520
Blame yourself.

415
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:14,479
Blame the accursed destiny
of this royal family.

416
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,359
Feng Chang,

417
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,719
why do you wish to harm me so?

418
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,880
I once told you

419
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,199
that we should go our separate ways.

420
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,839
Why do you have to come here?

421
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,959
Why can't you sever the tie between us?

422
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,199
When I was young,

423
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
my mother told me
that you had a rough life

424
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,719
and that your mother didn't acknowledge
you as her son.

425
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:51,199
That's why my mother asked me
to be extra kind to you.

426
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,439
I cannot just stand still

427
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,319
while you continue to suffer.

428
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
I know

429
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,479
until now,

430
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,439
you take care of me more than
I take care of you.

431
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,760
I want you

432
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,040
to live a carefree life.

433
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,560
If you have made up your mind,

434
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,479
then I have nothing else to add.

435
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,479
Feng Chang, you have been looking
for a Golden Rattan Whip.

436
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,319
I found one.

437
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,239
Unfortunately,

438
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,680
we might have to let our mother down
this time.

439
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,760
Feng Chang...

440
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,239
Stop pretending already.

441
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:27,239
You

442
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,239
are not the Feng Lanxi I know.

443
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,319
And I

444
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,079
am not the Feng Chang you know.

445
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:42,719
Go.

446
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,640
Now!

447
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,599
Why do you have to do this to her?

448
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,439
Why?

449
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,760
Why?

450
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:37,760
(Xuliu Parlor)

451
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,640
Feng Chang!

452
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,119
(Xuliu Parlor)
Feng Chang!

453
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,079
Isn't this Prince Chang?

454
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,280
Feng Chang!

455
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,239
Summon the physician.

456
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,199
Now!

457
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,239
Your Highness,

458
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,319
I'm from the Medical Bureau...

459
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,719
Enough. Just help my brother.

460
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,199
Prince Chang is safe.

461
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:03,560
Now, carry my brother back to
the residence to receive treatments.

462
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:03,959
Hurry up.

463
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:04,520
Yes, Your Highness.

464
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,520
Careful.

465
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:07,760
(Xuliu Parlor)

466
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,839
Here. Quick.

467
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,199
What happened upstairs?

468
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,520
Who was upstairs?

469
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,680
Prince Yongping is upstairs.

470
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,199
Did something...

471
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,680
I'm held accountable

472
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,680
when such a serious issue happened.

473
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,280
Any brave soul here

474
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,880
is willing to go upstairs with me

475
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,520
to be my witness?

476
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,160
I...

477
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,760
Don't worry.

478
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,160
I'll come with you.

479
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,359
Thank you, Your Highness.

480
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,479
Let's go.

481
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,640
Right, let's check it out.

482
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,680
Go.

483
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,439
This is...

484
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,560
I...

485
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,160
Cheng.

486
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,199
My daughter!

487
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,079
My love!

488
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,280
Cheng! Cheng!

489
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:51,040
My daughter!

490
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,959
Cheng!

491
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,079
My condolences, Duke Qi.

492
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,079
This tragedy took place in my garden.

493
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,319
I will investigate it thoroughly

494
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,400
to give you an answer.

495
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,359
Can someone

496
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,199
please carry the Duke's wife
and her daughter out?

497
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,839
Duke Qi,

498
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,239
I'm sorry.

499
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,680
Where is Prince Yongping?

500
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,640
(Duke Qi)
He was the only one

501
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,479
(Duke Qi)
upstairs.

502
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,000
Only he could kill my daughter
and Prince Chang.

503
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,920
Where is he?

504
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:25,280
Where is he?

505
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,680
Where is he now?

506
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,119
He is...

507
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,640
I...

508
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,719
Your Highness, may I know
where you were just now?

509
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,920
Shouldn't you be watching
the performance upstairs?

510
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,719
It was a rather boring performance

511
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,839
so I came down to fish.

512
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,439
Do you have an alibi?

513
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,280
Do I need an alibi

514
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:46,599
for a fishing trip?

515
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:48,839
But Miss Qi was killed.

516
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,800
Prince Chang fell from the second floor.

517
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:52,319
You need to prove your innocence.

518
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:52,959
What?

519
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,359
Feng Chang did?

520
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:57,800
Lanxi.

521
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:58,719
I'll visit Feng Chang.

522
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,439
Lanxi,

523
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,439
please clear your name first.

524
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:06,959
All right.

525
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,520
I was fishing by the pond.

526
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,280
Someone saw me.

527
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,839
We did see each other

528
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,760
in the garden.

529
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:15,560
I can testify

530
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:17,560
that Prince Yongping was next to me.

531
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
But that is insufficient.

532
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,959
Official Baili Jing, why are you here?

533
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,520
You're the murderer!

534
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:28,439
I'll kill you.

535
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,479
Stop!

536
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,599
I'll kill you.

537
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,359
Calm down, Duke Qi.

538
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,640
Even if His Lordship wants me
to pay with my life,

539
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,520
I still want to avenge my daughter.

540
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:37,839
Calm down, Duke Qi.

541
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:38,760
No matter what,

542
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,920
His Lordship will give you an answer.

543
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:46,280
Cheng!

544
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:05,400
Lower your head

545
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:06,040
and follow me.

546
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,319
Greetings, Prince Yongping.

547
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:16,760
Here, please.

548
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:17,760
Your Highness.

549
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,400
It's your fault.

550
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,160
You wanted to use Feng Chang
to frame me.

551
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,479
Don't worry.

552
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,920
No one

553
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:45,920
will be able to walk out scot-free.

554
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,000
Your Lordship,

555
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,479
I demand justice!

556
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:10,719
My daughter

557
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:13,199
was but 19 of age.

558
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:14,280
Your Lordship!

559
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,560
Don't you worry, my loyal minister.

560
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,800
I will

561
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,239
definitely get to the bottom of this

562
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,839
and give you a satisfactory answer.

563
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,319
How is

564
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,640
Prince Yongxin?

565
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:26,719
Your Lordship,

566
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,319
the physician said
that Prince Yongxin survived

567
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,000
but he remained unconscious.

568
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,680
However, due to his broken right leg,

569
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:35,119
he might be handicapped in the future.

570
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,359
And what about Baili Jing?

571
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:41,000
Other than the scratches on his face,

572
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,280
he has sustained any external injury.

573
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,640
But he is in this

574
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,959
catatonic state now,

575
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:49,000
as if he suffered tremendous trauma.

576
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,760
As to whether it's real or it's an act,

577
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:53,839
we'll know
after the constable interrogates him.

578
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:55,239
Yes, Your Lordship.

579
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,359
Any comment?

580
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,439
Father,

581
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,479
obviously,

582
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,880
this is but a framing device
deliberately set up against me.

583
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,640
It is fortunate
that I left Xuliu Parlor early.

584
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,119
Otherwise, the name of such a crime

585
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:09,719
will fall onto me.

586
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:12,319
It is uncanny what has transpired today.

587
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,839
Prince Yongping must have come prepared.

588
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:17,319
When you talk to His Lordship later,

589
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,040
defend your brother.

590
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,959
That way,

591
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,880
he won't suspect you of anything.

592
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:24,800
Father,

593
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,880
I am just as perplexed.

594
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:29,079
I don't know what exactly happened.

595
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,839
However,
this arrogant criminal hurt Qi Cheng,

596
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,079
hurt Feng Chang,

597
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,239
and wanted to frame Lanxi.

598
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,079
He has committed a serious crime.

599
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:41,160
You're right, Prince Ju.

600
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,959
Your Lordship,

601
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,800
Prince Yongping
was remaining in the parlor

602
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:50,199
only to change his mind suddenly
to fish by the pond.

603
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,920
Coincidentally,
Baili Jing was there too.

604
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,479
I'm sure

605
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:57,000
Prince Yongping holds more information.

606
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,239
It is quite possible

607
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,280
that all this

608
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,680
is just his attempt to frame Baili Jing.

609
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,839
Why would I do that?

610
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:06,359
You have a close tie
with Prince Chang.

611
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,160
Why would

612
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,199
he frame you out of a sudden?

613
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,000
Besides,

614
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:11,439
who will benefit the most

615
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,839
from pinning this crime
against Baili Jing

616
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,280
other than Prince Chang,
Your Highness?

617
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,560
Now that we have the evidence,

618
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,160
do you still think it's my doing,
Duke Qi?

619
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,839
Do you think

620
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:23,119
you can accuse the royal family
of wrongdoing like that?

621
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:23,920
You...

622
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:29,400
Duke Qi must be too grief-stricken

623
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,239
to mince his words.

624
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,400
You have a generous soul, Your Highness.

625
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,880
Please forgive him.

626
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,680
As for Duke Qi's accusation,

627
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,479
I'm afraid we can only decide

628
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,800
after Prince Chang

629
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,680
regains consciousness.

630
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:48,079
Let's wait until Zhang Zhongge

631
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,119
is done interrogating everyone.

632
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,319
Summon the Chief and the Deputy Chief
of Medical Bureau

633
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,800
to Prince Yongxin's residence.

634
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,800
Wake him up as soon as possible.

635
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,319
All of you are dismissed for now.

636
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,439
As you wish, Your Lordship.

637
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:14,839
Yuan Lu.

638
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:17,400
Yes, Your Lordship?

639
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,880
Who

640
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,359
do you think is the culprit?

641
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,000
I

642
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,599
do not have an answer either,
Your Lordship.

643
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,920
Baili Jing is an eyesore

644
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:32,000
but I don't believe

645
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,760
he can commit this grave crime

646
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,479
out of lust.

647
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,280
Do you think

648
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,079
perhaps Feng Chang wished to frame Lanxi

649
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:44,880
only to be outmaneuvered by the latter?

650
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,640
Pardon my incompetence.

651
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,839
I do not know.

652
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,400
However, I'm inclined

653
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,760
to believe that Prince Chang
is a victim too.

654
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,439
If he wished to frame another person,

655
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,000
he did not need to risk his own life.

656
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,199
No handicapped prince

657
00:33:58,199 --> 00:33:59,280
has inherited the throne in Yongzhou.

658
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:00,199
Even if there is a precedence,

659
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,479
falling

660
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,760
from a high place like this
is simply too perilous a plan.

661
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,640
So that left Feng Ju and the Queen then?

662
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,879
He thought he could get rid

663
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,280
of his two elder brothers with one plan.

664
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,719
That way, the title of the heir

665
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,159
would naturally fall onto him.

666
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,199
I, Baili, wish to talk to you,
Your Lordship.

667
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,520
Isn't she confined to her palace?

668
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,280
Why is she here?

669
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:24,199
Ask her to return.

670
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,399
Yes, Your Lordship.

671
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,639
Your Highness,

672
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,000
please return.

673
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,600
You still have to serve
your confinement.

674
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,560
Please return, Your Highness.

675
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,199
Move aside.

676
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,560
I will see His Lordship today.

677
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,879
Your Highness.

678
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,040
Your Highness.

679
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,239
Dismissed.

680
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,239
Yes, Your Lordship.

681
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,040
What are you doing?

682
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,399
I know my brother
has committed a serious crime.

683
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,879
I'm not here to give you excuses.

684
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:07,919
Please allow me to renounce my title

685
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,959
and set an example for your concubines.

686
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,439
I already have a lot on my plate.

687
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,360
I don't need more.

688
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,280
This is not an act, Your Lordship.

689
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,360
I personally selected Miss Qi Cheng
to be my daughter-in-law.

690
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,199
Now that she has been killed,

691
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,360
I can't help but feel guilty.

692
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,479
Whether my brother

693
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:32,040
will be found guilty

694
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,399
or if you will punish me,

695
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:38,520
I am willing to promise three things
on behalf of the Baili family.

696
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:42,159
One, compensate Duke Qi and his family
5,000 pieces of gold.

697
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,040
Two,

698
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:45,040
the son of Baili Jing

699
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,600
will marry the niece of Duke Qi.

700
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:48,560
Three,

701
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,040
the title inherited
by my maternal family

702
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:54,879
will be bequeathed to the son
of Duke Qi's niece.

703
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,719
May these compensatory gestures

704
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,520
put your mind to rest

705
00:35:58,879 --> 00:36:01,520
and ease the pain of Duke Qi.

706
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:07,879
We'll discuss that

707
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:09,719
later.

708
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:11,360
Since I'm ready

709
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,639
to renounce my queenhood,

710
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,360
I might as well come clean.

711
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:18,959
I know you have been growing
suspicious of me

712
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,000
but I can swear with my own life

713
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,080
that what transpired today

714
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:25,800
has nothing to do with me or Ju.

715
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,239
I know nothing

716
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:28,479
about the nefarious plot

717
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,919
on Xuliu Parlor today.

718
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,239
However,
you are a shrewd man, Your Lordship.

719
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,080
You must know

720
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,040
that the one who stands
to benefit the most

721
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,239
must be the mastermind.

722
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:42,120
I can do many things

723
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:43,959
but I can't possibly devise an evil plan

724
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:46,560
when I was confined to my palace.

725
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,239
Ju can be as bold as he claims to be

726
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,800
but he'll never devise a plan

727
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,679
that jeopardizes

728
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,439
the life of his own uncle.

729
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:54,840
Chang...

730
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,239
Chang

731
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,959
is also my son,
regardless of everything.

732
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,239
All right.

733
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,159
Don't cry.

734
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,520
I will

735
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,120
get to the bottom of this.

736
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:30,439
Go back to your palace now.

737
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,439
Your Lordship,

738
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,159
I have sealed and searched

739
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,719
Official Jiang's garden.

740
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,399
I found a dead body.

741
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,719
It's the servant in blue
who went missing

742
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,919
in Xuliu Parlor.

743
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,520
An evidence erasure?

744
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,560
Yes.

745
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:50,000
Also, I found this

746
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,919
in his grip.

747
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,080
A dark fox fur coat?

748
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,159
Yes.

749
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:59,239
It was soaked in wine.

750
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,120
I had a dog sniff it.

751
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,879
It bears the same scent as the wine

752
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,000
on Miss Qi Cheng's body.

753
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:06,479
Issue a decree

754
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,399
that other than Feng Chang,

755
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,919
all noblemen who took part
in the plum blossom festival

756
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,159
have to reflect upon themselves
in their abode.

757
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,959
Without my permission,

758
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,120
none can venture out.

759
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,679
Once Feng Chang wakes up,

760
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,000
we'll know who's guilty

761
00:38:22,439 --> 00:38:23,479
and who's innocent.

762
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,679
Yes,

763
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,600
Your Lordship.

764
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,719
Who did this?

765
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,120
Calm down, Mother.

766
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:35,560
It's Baili Jing's idea.

767
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,520
He said

768
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:37,560
that we could seize this opportunity

769
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,679
to get rid of Feng Chang and Feng Lanxi.

770
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,159
That's why I agreed to it.

771
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,520
He was smart enough to devise this plan?

772
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,600
I speak the truth, Mother.

773
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,479
I would never do this otherwise.

774
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:46,879
Mother,

775
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,120
what should I do?

776
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:50,679
You left

777
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,120
such a mess to me.

778
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,639
And now, I have to deal with it.

779
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,040
Go back to your residence

780
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
and stop giving me more trouble.

781
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,239
Yes.

782
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,239
Yes.

783
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,600
Are you telling the truth?

784
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,280
Why are you examining
the dark fox fur coat, Official Zhang?

785
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,919
Is it related to the perpetrator?

786
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,840
Sorry for the inconvenience,
Your Highness.

787
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:39,199
Chancellor Ren,

788
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:41,040
His Lordship has ordered

789
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,879
that all staff
of Prince Yongping's Residence

790
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,159
have to stay here for a few days.

791
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:49,959
Even government officials like you

792
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,639
are not allowed to leave or enter.

793
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,199
Noted.

794
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,639
I will not disturb you further,
Your Highness.

795
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,040
I will take my leave now.

796
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,479
Miss,

797
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,399
I have sent the new fox fur coat
to Prince Yongping.

798
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,679
Did anyone see you?

799
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:15,040
I have been very careful.

800
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,080
No one has noticed me.

801
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,399
Good.

802
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:22,120
Keep Prince Yongping's old fox fur coat.

803
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:24,439
Why don't we destroy it?

804
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,360
Prince Chang is still unconscious.

805
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:28,040
Everything is uncertain.

806
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,120
To clear His Highness's name,

807
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,000
we have to prove
that Baili Jing is guilty

808
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,239
before Prince Chang wakes up.

809
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:35,959
The fox fur coat

810
00:40:36,439 --> 00:40:37,320
is the evidence.

811
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,040
His Highness cannot leave his abode.

812
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,639
People will talk, naturally.

813
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,719
So I have to deal with this.

814
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,360
If only

815
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,280
His Highness could
reciprocate your feeling.

816
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:50,800
My wish

817
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,360
is to make sure he can achieve

818
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,600
what he can achieve.
