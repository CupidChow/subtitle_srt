=Episode 30=

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,879
Your Lordship.

21
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,760
Why do you distrust Marquis Yongping so?

22
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,959
Father knows best.

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,720
If he hides for another decade,

24
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:54,839
then I'll have no choice.

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,040
Your Lordship.

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,440
If the princess agrees to
Prince Lanxi's proposal,

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,000
will he ally with Youzhou

28
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:05,199
to overthrow Yongzhou?

29
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,240
He is a smart man.

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,199
He knows

31
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,479
if I allow him to go to Youzhou,

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,080
I must have a contingency plan.

33
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,759
Now, he has to choose wisely.

34
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,080
So,

35
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,080
Prince Lanxi

36
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,279
isn't courting the Princess.

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,279
He's trying to gain your trust again,
Your Lordship.

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,720
We'll see.

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,160
The heir of Lord of Youzhou is placed
in confinement by the Lord of Youzhou.

40
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,440
At such a critical period,

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,440
Lord of Youzhou
leaves him in humiliation.

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,320
I'm afraid that after the confinement,

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,039
his status as the heir is at risk.

44
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,279
All four descendants of Lord of Youzhou

45
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:53,759
are incapable and incompetent.

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,479
The heir is just

47
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,160
comparatively better
than his incapable brothers.

48
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,559
I heard

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,039
that it was the censorates

50
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,279
who dropped a dime on him
during the royal court meeting.

51
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:05,960
What do you think about this?

52
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,679
The censorates are
Lord of Youzhou's men.

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,320
This is interesting.

54
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:14,600
In my opinion,

55
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,639
there's another reason

56
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,720
behind the heir of Lord of Youzhou's
confinement.

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,479
It's due to Hua Chunran, isn't it?

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,039
Hua Chunran is appointed
as the Divine Fairy of Dadong.

59
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,559
He's the last person

60
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,759
to welcome her return.

61
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,199
Recently,

62
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,491
she's going to select her husband.

63
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,119
If she gets her ideal husband,

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,160
the heir of Lord of Youzhou
will be in a passive situation.

65
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,399
Hua Chunran has just returned

66
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,880
to Youzhou for less than a month,

67
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,119
yet she managed to overthrow
the heir of Lord of Youzhou.

68
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,479
She's rather capable indeed.

69
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,839
If she becomes your companion,

70
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,479
the world will be at peace.

71
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,160
I'd be relieved too.

72
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,759
After I unify and rule the world,

73
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:54,679
you'll

74
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,520
still be my dearest friend.

75
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:03,080
(Youzhou)

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Your Highness.

77
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,760
Princess Hua.

78
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,839
I've been sitting still
for more than two hours.

79
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,559
I'm really tired.

80
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,040
What are you trying to do?

81
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,119
Just a minute.

82
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,119
This is too heavy. I can't wear it.

83
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Okay, don't wear it then.

84
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,000
You can wear this
Sailing Clouds and Frosty Peaks.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,239
It looks more unique.

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,679
What are you doing, Princess Hua?

87
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,239
I'm preparing for tomorrow.

88
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,480
Tomorrow?

89
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,119
You're the one who is going
to select a husband tomorrow.

90
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,320
I'm not.

91
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,359
What preparations do I have to make?

92
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,239
You promised to help me.

93
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,200
Tomorrow,

94
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,720
I just need to knock down everyone

95
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,760
except for Black Foxy.

96
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,239
In this way,

97
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,600
the others won't have the audacity
to ask you for marriage.

98
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,640
Great.

99
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,119
If there's nothing else,
I'll go to sleep then.

100
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,119
- I'm really tired.
- Miss Feng.

101
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,119
Miss Feng.

102
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,880
You've been putting on make-up.

103
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,119
You shouldn't give up halfway through.

104
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:39,880
Chunran, I...

105
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,559
I heard your voice from afar.

106
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,040
When can you be more refined?

107
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,799
Mr. Feng.

108
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,079
Look. Doesn't Miss Feng

109
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,440
look extremely fine today?

110
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,480
What do you think, Sir?

111
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,079
Princess Hua.

112
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,880
You're overrating it.

113
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,760
I think she looks okay.

114
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,720
You won't look like a crown prince
even if you're wearing a yellow robe.

115
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:07,880
Do you hear that?

116
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:09,119
The effort is in vain.

117
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:10,119
I'm leaving.

118
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,239
By the way,

119
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,839
tomorrow is the day
of the royal marriage proposal.

120
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,079
I'll get going then.

121
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,079
Okay.

122
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,559
However, Miss Feng
needs to stay in the palace.

123
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,600
I have a favor to ask.

124
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:22,519
Okay.

125
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,119
I'll leave first.

126
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,200
Princess Hua.

127
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,880
I'm really tired.

128
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,920
I shall go back and sleep.

129
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
I'll come back later.

130
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,600
Miss Feng.

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,440
The pearl cake is almost ready.

132
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,040
Come on.

133
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,359
Sir.

134
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,239
The men I sent to spy on
Youzhou Royal Palace reported

135
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,839
that Feng Lanxi had left the palace.

136
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,480
Do it.

137
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,799
Okay.

138
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:01,145
(Map of the Capital of Youzhou)

139
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,760
It does feel weird

140
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,440
without my inner force.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You can't perform martial arts now.

142
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:04,887
You are no match for us.

143
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,279
Looks like

144
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,200
you know about a lot of things.

145
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:10,366
But you don't know about this.

146
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:13,519
I've learned
the art of fighting for war.

147
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,959
(It feels nice)

148
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,239
(to be protected.)

149
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,039
Are you all right?

150
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,280
I can still hold on.

151
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,599
(Who is he?)

152
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,520
(Why did he use Sacred Jade Moon?)

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,039
Someone is here. Let's leave.

154
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,000
Take the corpses back for investigation.

155
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,400
Tomorrow is the day
of the royal marriage proposal.

156
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,280
Nothing can go wrong.

157
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:19,280
Noted.

158
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,239
Are you feeling better?

159
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,919
Yes.

160
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,559
If it weren't for you,

161
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,520
I might have died.

162
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,960
Thank you.

163
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,880
It seems that they're
from the Soultaker Sect.

164
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,719
Why are the people
from Soultaker Sect still alive?

165
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,119
I have no idea too.

166
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,280
The last person who fought against you

167
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,599
has an inner force
that seems like Sacred Jade Moon.

168
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,080
However, he didn't know how to use it.

169
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,840
It doesn't seem like
he acquired it through practice.

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,520
It seems like
he has stolen it from someone.

171
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,559
Stole?

172
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,200
Does this have to do

173
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,760
with the mysterious man from Yongzhou?

174
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,440
He stored both our inner forces

175
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,119
in his body

176
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:44,200
through Qiwu's accident.

177
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,599
That's possible.

178
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,440
He showed up alongside the people
from Soultaker Sect.

179
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,640
There's something wrong with this.

180
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,559
There must be a conspiracy

181
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,080
hiding behind the incident.

182
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,039
I'm suspecting
that this has something to do

183
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,760
with the Locust and the Cricket.

184
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,280
Soultaker Sect.

185
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,119
Sacred Jade Moon.

186
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,520
The Locust and the Cricket.

187
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,799
I think

188
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,679
the Locust and the Cricket are
the ones behind Soultaker Sect.

189
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,760
They went on a killing spree
in the martial arts world

190
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,359
and played havoc
with the situation discreetly.

191
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,440
I'm afraid that their purpose

192
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,000
is to overthrow Dadong's reign.

193
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,960
People will be in great misery.

194
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,640
Heroine Feng.

195
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,200
Let's

196
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,359
change the situation, shall we?

197
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,239
It suits me fine.

198
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,960
By the way.

199
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
These are the questions for
Hua Chunran's royal marriage proposal.

200
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,760
The first test is the martial arts test.

201
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,320
She might be unaware of your situation.

202
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,520
I think

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,719
that your first test

204
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
will be rather tough.

205
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,080
It's fine.

206
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,440
What tricks do you have

207
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:49,799
up your sleeve, Black Foxy?

208
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:52,320
I have you.

209
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,880
I am afraid of nothing.

210
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,159
Two meals.

211
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,919
You must cook me two meals.

212
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,880
Deal.

213
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,239
Ever since the date
of the royal marriage proposal

214
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:16,919
for Princess Chunran is confirmed,

215
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,599
capable men have gathered in Youzhou.

216
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,119
(As Vigorous As Pine)
Today's examination

217
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,880
will be conducted by Princess Chunran.

218
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,440
Your Highness.

219
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,400
Why hasn't Mr. Feng arrived yet?

220
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,840
Let's wait a little longer.

221
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:30,880
I believe that he will surely come.

222
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,679
Zeng Youliang.

223
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,599
Shan Yecheng, Young Master of
Tiantong Chamber of Commerce.

224
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,961
(As Vigorous As Pine)

225
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,520
This way, please.

226
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,280
Ming Yueshan,
Young Master of Ming Family of Shangzhou.

227
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:45,320
These heroes are all capable.

228
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,479
That's right.

229
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,479
The Ming family from Shangzhou
is not only wealthy,

230
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,239
but they are also good at martial arts.

231
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,756
(As Vigorous As Pine)

232
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,119
The heir of Lord of Jizhou, Huang Chao.

233
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,479
The Finest Gentry, Yu Wuyuan.

234
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,961
(As Vigorous As Pine)

235
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,159
The only person who can make Yu Wuyuan

236
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,400
serve as a foil

237
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:07,280
is Huang Chao.

238
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,359
This way, please.

239
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,640
It's him.

240
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,159
He's Huang Chao?

241
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,280
Is Prince Huang brilliant?

242
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,000
He's brilliant indeed,

243
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,760
but he's not my ideal husband.

244
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,472
Marquis Yongping of Yongzhou,

245
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,760
(As Vigorous As Pine)
Feng Lanxi.

246
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,359
Feng Lanxi,
Marquis Yongping of Yongzhou.

247
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:42,119
Feng Lanxi, Marquis Yongping
of Yongzhou is present.

248
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,280
(As Vigorous As Pine)

249
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,919
This way, please.

250
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,840
Feng Lanxi.

251
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,320
Hei Fengxi.

252
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,479
I need to see Father.

253
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,242
(Cailian Platform)

254
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,559
Greetings, dear heroes.

255
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,599
It's nice to meet you.

256
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,799
Greetings, Your Highness.

257
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,320
Never mind the courtesies.

258
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:30,200
I'm honored

259
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:31,960
(Cailian Platform)
to meet you today.

260
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,559
I shall play you a song

261
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,880
to express my sincerity.

262
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,679
All comments are welcome.

263
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,320
Even if I didn't get to be selected
to be the Prince Consort,

264
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
it's worth the trip

265
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,119
as I'm able to enjoy
Your Highness' guqin performance.

266
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,200
That's right.

267
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,320
What song are you going to play,
Your Highness?

268
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,440
This pavilion is surrounded 
by water lily.

269
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:54,320
Today,

270
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:57,799
I shall play you the Water Lily Tune.

271
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:07,535
(Cailian Platform)

272
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,620
(Cailian Platform)

273
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,039
Greetings, Your Lordship.

274
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,880
Long live the Lord.

275
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,280
Please get up, Chun.

276
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,200
Shouldn't you be at Jinhua Palace?

277
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,080
What brings you here?

278
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,320
I've asked Bai Fengxi
to disguise herself as me

279
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,599
and stay at Jinhua Palace.

280
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,719
Nonsense.

281
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,919
How could you ask others
to select a husband on your behalf?

282
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,119
Chunran.

283
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,679
Are you taking a fancy to Hei Fengxi?

284
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:44,734
Hence, you're asking
for Bai Fengxi's help, aren't you?

285
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,400
Previously, yes.

286
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,640
But

287
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,479
I've changed my mind.

288
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:50,960
What?

289
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,440
I found out

290
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,440
that Hei Fengxi of Fountain Abode

291
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,799
is Feng Lanxi,
Marquis Yongping of Yongzhou.

292
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,479
What did you say?

293
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,599
When they were entering the hall,

294
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,919
I was watching at the side.

295
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,799
I didn't hear

296
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,719
the title of Hei Fengxi
of Fountain Abode

297
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,400
until Feng Lanxi showed up.

298
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,719
I found out

299
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:08,959
that they are the same person.

300
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,680
Are you sure?

301
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,119
They are in the palace these few days.

302
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,359
I'm very sure about this.

303
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,680
Feng Lanxi

304
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,719
is Hei Fengxi.

305
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,479
There are only two possibilities.

306
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,800
First. They are acutally the same person.

307
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,359
Feng Lanxi ventures
into the martial arts world

308
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,400
in the name of
Hei Fengxi of Fountain Abode.

309
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:35,479
He hides his own identity.

310
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,640
Second.

311
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,359
Feng Lanxi

312
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:42,479
is close with Bai Fengxi.

313
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:45,800
He uses Bai Fengxi

314
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,719
to cover for Hei Fengxi

315
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:49,040
to approach you.

316
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,880
Just like how you asked
Bai Fengxi to pretend to be you.

317
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,959
No matter the reason,

318
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,599
this man is even more cunning

319
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,040
and capable

320
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:05,199
than Prince Huang Chao.

321
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,920
Feng Lanxi is sharp and cunning.

322
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:10,199
I'm afraid he's not here
for the marriage proposal.

323
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:11,959
His purpose...

324
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,800
His purpose

325
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:17,079
is Youzhou.

326
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,319
I seek your approval, Father.

327
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,920
Set Cangmang Endgame
as the palace examination question.

328
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,880
The Cangmang Endgame?

329
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,560
Are you certain?

330
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,760
Only the Cangmang Endgame

331
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
can make him bewildered.

332
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,719
The tune

333
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,040
is unmatchable and unique.

334
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,280
What a melodious tune!

335
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,280
The tune is fresh and unconventional.

336
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,119
It depicts an unusual vibe.

337
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,079
Your Highness is good at guqin indeed.

338
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:15,439
I'm flattered.

339
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,315
(Cailian Platform)

340
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,239
I apologize

341
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,880
for my poor skills.

342
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,719
Your Highness is
the most beautiful lady in Dadong.

343
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,839
We've been wanting

344
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:24,040
to catch a glimpse of your beauty.

345
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,359
Would Your Highness be kind enough
to show yourself to us?

346
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,199
Yes.

347
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:29,520
Please let us catch a glimpse
of your beauty, Your Highness.

348
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,040
There's only one Prince Consort.

349
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,439
Even if we fail to be selected,

350
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,680
it's still worth it

351
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,760
as we get to see Your Highness.

352
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,920
After I've selected my husband,

353
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,920
I'll show myself.

354
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,119
Hurry up and start the test then,
Your Highness.

355
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,718
(Cailian Platform)

356
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,119
Since little, I aspire

357
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,920
to marry the most outstanding hero
in the world.

358
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,359
Otherwise,

359
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,079
I rather spend
the rest of my life alone.

360
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,160
My future husband must be an all-rounder

361
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,800
who has great looks and capabilities.

362
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,920
Hence,

363
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,479
there are two tests
for the royal marriage proposal.

364
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,079
This is the venue
for the martial arts test,

365
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,520
which is the first test.

366
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,680
You have to get to the Cailian Platform.

367
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,520
You can step on
the flowers to cross the lake,

368
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:14,040
but you mustn't use any tools.

369
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,560
Whoever falls into the lake
is disqualified.

370
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,439
(Feng Lanxi has no inner force.)

371
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,439
(How could he pass the test?)

372
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,000
Back then,

373
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,520
Old Taiyin and Old Tianji

374
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,640
played chess at Mount Cangmang, Youzhou.

375
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,599
After they left,

376
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,920
I found the endgame at the peak.

377
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,479
Rumor has it

378
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,239
that the world's disputes
can be deduced from the endgame.

379
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,400
Even Old Taiyin and Old Tianji

380
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,920
couldn't solve the puzzle.

381
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,119
What if Feng Lanxi is able to solve it?

382
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,079
If he can solve the endgame,

383
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,560
he'll rule the world.

384
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm willing

385
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,319
to marry him.

386
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,439
Chun.

387
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,040
I'll do as you wish.

388
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,560
From the pavilion
to the Cailian Platform,

389
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,239
it's about a distance of seven zhang.

390
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,359
For normal warriors,

391
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
they can leap as far
as four zhang with Qinggong.

392
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,319
For notable warriors,

393
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,880
they can leap as far as six zhang.

394
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,839
It's rare to find someone
who can leap as far as seven zhang.

395
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,400
If no one can do it,

396
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,000
we have no choice but to suspect

397
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,239
that Your Highness
is just fooling us around.

398
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,199
You're sharp indeed, Mr. Ming.

399
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,680
However, I can assure you

400
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,880
that someone could achieve it.

401
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,319
I've made a friend in the palace.

402
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,560
Although she is a woman,

403
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,439
she can easily leap
to the Cailian Platform

404
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,199
without any help.

405
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,079
Who is it?

406
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,160
Bai Fengxi.

407
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,079
Since Heroine Fengxi can do it,

408
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,640
I'll give it a try then.

409
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,040
I didn't expect Princess Chunran

410
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:08,640
to be good at martial arts.

411
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,520
Thank you for the help,

412
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,119
Your Highness.

413
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:16,119
Although you've arrived
at the Cailian Platform,

414
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,719
you had help from others.

415
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,959
You didn't pass the test.

416
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,280
I'm ashamed.

417
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,599
I shall leave.

418
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:31,400
I, Feng Lanxi from Yongzhou,
would like to try.

419
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:58,719
I see.

420
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,439
She's the only woman in this world

421
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:02,719
who is good at martial arts

422
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
and has the guts to pretend

423
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,359
to be the Princess.

424
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,719
Congratulations, Prince Lanxi.

425
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,400
I shall give this a try too.

426
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,400
You're remarkable indeed, Prince Huang.

427
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,760
I would like to see you in person.

428
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,680
You shall

429
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,000
see me in person
during the liberal arts test tomorrow.

430
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,839
Aren't you afraid of getting busted?

431
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,880
Not many are capable of reaching here.

432
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:44,839
Even if they pass through the curtains,

433
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:47,000
I won't let them see my face.

434
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:47,959
Well, well.

435
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,920
I have a question.

436
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:52,520
If I get to rule the world,

437
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,199
would you marry me and be my empress?

438
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:54,880
No.

439
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,079
You're the only woman

440
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,719
who can reject my offer like this.

441
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:09,680
Report.

442
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,640
Your Lordship.

443
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,760
The martial art test at
Cailian Platform has ended.

444
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,119
This is the list of passing candidates.

445
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,160
You can leave now.

446
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:23,920
Yes, Your Lordship.

447
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,959
As we expected,

448
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,040
Feng Lanxi and Huang Chao

449
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,119
are both on the list.

450
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,400
What do you think of this?

451
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,880
Excluding Huang Chao and Feng Lanxi,

452
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,280
the rest are mediocre.

453
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,479
If that's so,

454
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,520
you don't have many choices

455
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,199
for the royal marriage proposal then.

456
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,079
Father.

457
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:53,040
We can't be sure yet.
What about the Cangmang Endgame?

458
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,359
Chunran.

459
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,359
Do you really think that Feng Lanxi

460
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,439
is able to solve the endgame?

461
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,520
I don't know.

462
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,520
But if it's him,

463
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,119
that might be possible.

464
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,160
You know it too, Father.

465
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,000
If he manages to solve it,

466
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,160
I'll stand a chance to wear Feng Crown.

467
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:14,839
Chunran.

468
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,319
I understand.

469
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,439
But in my opinion,

470
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,160
his doings

471
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,880
are unpredictable.

472
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
A man like him

473
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,680
is daunting.

474
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,640
All Six States are
fighting for the throne.

475
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:39,520
The other states have become powerful

476
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:43,680
as they expanded their territories
toward Imperial City.

477
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:48,160
Only Youzhou is sandwiched
between Qingzhou and Jizhou.

478
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,680
All these years,

479
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,640
our land hasn't expanded.

480
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,599
In due course of time,

481
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:58,280
Youzhou will eventually
be annexed by Jizhou and Qingzhou.

482
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,079
Even if Feng Lanxi

483
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,920
manages to solve the Cangmang Endgame,

484
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,239
Youzhou

485
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,920
is destined to be annexed.

486
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,560
What are you trying to say, Father?

487
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,640
I know you better than anyone else.

488
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,760
I know you're sincere about Feng Lanxi.

489
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,920
However, in terms
of appearance and capabilities,

490
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,640
Huang Chao from Jizhou
is as good as Feng Lanxi.

491
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:25,959
If we form a marriage
alliance with Jizhou,

492
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,719
we'll be in alliance with Jizhou.

493
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,000
Prince Huang Chao promised
to aid us in attacking Qingzhou

494
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,439
when he asked you for marriage.

495
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,560
If I get the help
of the Skyrider Cavalry,

496
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,160
Feng Xingtao of Qingzhou
is no match for me.

497
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,280
Qingzhou will be mine.

498
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,119
Hence...

499
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,280
Hence, you want me

500
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,920
to choose Prince Huang Chao
as my husband,

501
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:53,760
don't you, Father?

502
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,839
Chun.

503
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,079
That's right.

504
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,760
Although Prince Huang Chao
has the ambition to rule the world,

505
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,239
his kingcraft

506
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,319
will leave a ray of hope to Youzhou.

507
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,479
Noted, Your Lordship.

508
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:30,839
Fengxi.

509
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:36,079
I'd like to ask the question

510
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:37,920
I asked you at Cailian Platform again.

511
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,959
That's unnecessary.

512
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:43,959
I'm serious about this.

513
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,599
If you're serious about this,

514
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,920
I'll ask you a serious question as well.

515
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,640
If I were to be your wife,

516
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,839
you could never
marry any other women.

517
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,760
Can you do that?

518
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,479
I know the answer.

519
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,560
There's a person in the palace

520
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,439
that you want to marry regardless.

521
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:03,640
Am I right?

522
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,800
You know about the reason.

523
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:09,959
But you are
the most important person in my heart.

524
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:11,760
Huang Chao.

525
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,079
I'm different from you.

526
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,199
You can marry many women
no matter whether you like them or not.

527
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:18,599
But I'm different.

528
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,439
I just want to find someone I love

529
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,560
who only loves me.

530
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,920
If I get to be the Emperor,

531
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,079
you will be my empress.

532
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,599
I, Huang Chao, swear to God

533
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,239
that if you marry me,

534
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:37,079
you'll be my only wife.

535
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,880
Unfortunately,

536
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,239
I'm not interested in being an empress.

537
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,800
As you said,

538
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,239
I have to

539
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,400
marry Princess Chunran regardless.

540
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:51,920
But that is necessary

541
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,719
to accomplish my ambition.

542
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,040
Ever since we've known each other,

543
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,719
I think of you

544
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,560
as a hero of integrity.

545
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,520
But you have to understand

546
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,479
that a hero doesn't
take advantage of a woman.

547
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,920
Half sincerity
and half premeditatedness.

548
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,359
Who knows?

549
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,079
You might suffer a setback
due to a woman.

550
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,479
You mustn't be proud.

551
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,959
Are you here to join in the fun, Mr. Yu?

552
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,239
There's nothing fun at all.

553
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,839
Everything is predestined.

554
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,760
Don't you want to know
between Feng Lanxi and Huang Chao,

555
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,079
who will get to marry Hua Chunran?

556
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:44,280
Miss Feng accompanies Prince Lanxi here.

557
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
How would he dare to marry someone else?

558
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,439
How can you be sure

559
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,000
that Huang Chao will be the winner?

560
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,479
Well,

561
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,280
to Youzhou,

562
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,439
Huang Chao isn't
an ideal Prince Consort.

563
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,359
Besides,

564
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,760
if this is the case,

565
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,079
Hua Chunran wouldn't seek my help.

566
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,439
If Prince Lanxi doesn't
intend to get selected,

567
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,160
Huang Chao will surely win.

568
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,079
Hua Chunran's will

569
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,079
is no longer important.

570
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,800
Moreover, Jizhou is powerful

571
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:13,119
and is located next to Youzhou.

572
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,880
A marriage alliance
between the two states

573
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,599
means that they want to join forces.

574
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,199
Why are you here then, Mr. Yu?

575
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,640
I'm here to observe
the structure of the world.

576
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,319
After the royal marriage proposal,

577
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,439
the conflict between
the Six States will begin.

578
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:29,479
The Lord of Youzhou uses his daughter

579
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,839
as the first move of it.

580
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,040
I'd like to know

581
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,959
about the second move.

582
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,680
If there's war,

583
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,560
I hope that I can protect
as many common people as I can

584
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,199
and prevent loss of life.

585
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,520
Your care for the world

586
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,880
is respectful indeed, Miss Feng.

587
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,839
What do you think
of the current situation

588
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,160
of the Six States, Miss Feng?

589
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,719
Me?

590
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,319
I'm just a woman
in the martial arts world.

591
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
How would I know?

592
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:04,479
But I'm directing the question

593
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:06,560
to the Princess of Qingzhou,

594
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:08,560
Princess Xiyun.

595
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,199
How did you know?

596
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,160
Marquis Yongping went to Liangcheng

597
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,040
and made peace with Prince Xieyue.

598
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,319
There must be
a wild card in the picture.

599
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,680
The wild card

600
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:24,760
can only be you, Miss Feng.

601
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,199
No wonder you're The Finest Gentry.

602
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:31,040
You know everything

603
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,400
in this world.

604
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:34,520
I'm flattered, Miss Feng.

605
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:36,680
It isn't hard to deduce

606
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,359
once you come to think of it.

607
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:49,307
(Yongzhou)

608
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,680
It's mealtime.

609
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,680
It's mealtime.

610
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,160
Master.

611
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,319
Father.

612
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,959
You can have it.

613
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,599
Eat up.

614
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,040
Master.

615
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,168
(Lanxi is concerned about your safety.)

616
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:38,339
(I'm afraid Lord of Yongzhou will
take action. I'll come to your rescue.)

617
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,864
(Lanxi is concerned about your safety.)

618
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:44,964
(I'm afraid Lord of Yongzhou will
take action. I'll come to your rescue.)

619
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,760
Gather the disciples.

620
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,719
Okay.

621
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,279
(Youzhou)

622
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,800
You've now passed the martial arts test.

623
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,920
It's up to yourself now.

624
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,839
The palace examination tomorrow

625
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:04,359
might test us

626
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:06,079
on the Cangmang Endgame.

627
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,160
The Cangmang Endgame?

628
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,599
Are you talking about the chess game

629
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:10,880
between Old Taiyin and Old Tianji?

630
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:11,920
That's right.

631
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:15,000
This is the only question

632
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,400
that would get me baffled in the world.

633
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,160
You're still so full of yourself.

634
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:22,280
I heard that the game

635
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,359
between Old Taiyin and Old Tianji

636
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,280
contains deduction
about the fate of the world.

637
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,439
It's extremely complicated.

638
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,400
You...

639
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,760
Is this part of your plan?

640
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,160
I have lost my martial arts skills.

641
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,520
The Fountain Abode
is not as powerful as before.

642
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:42,160
If I want to rule the world,

643
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,920
I need to think of another way.

644
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,040
The two masters
might have left some ways

645
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,000
in the chess game

646
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:50,560
to save the world from chaos

647
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,560
and let the people live in harmony.

648
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:54,719
If I can understand it,

649
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,359
I can save the world

650
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,359
from havoc.

651
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,920
You're

652
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:01,560
overthinking this.

653
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,040
Your opponent
has just thought of a move,

654
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280
yet you've thought of
a thousand ways to deal with it.

655
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,839
Listen,

656
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,600
it's better to be simple sometimes.

657
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,719
But a person like you

658
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,479
might be able to understand the endgame.

659
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
The issue of Youzhou
will be settled tomorrow.

660
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,399
You can loosen up a little.

661
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,719
What's next?

662
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,840
Are you going back
to the capital of Yongzhou?

663
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,639
I'll return to Tianshuang Sect
with you first.

664
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,520
All right.

665
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:32,032
When we're back at Tianshuang Sect,

666
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,760
I'll give you a tour around it.

667
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,040
That's a deal then.

668
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,320
I'd like to see

669
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,479
the place

670
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,239
you grew up in.

671
00:34:50,794 --> 00:34:54,747
(As Vigorous As Pine)

672
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:04,253
(Ceaselessly Neutral)

673
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,679
Greetings, Your Lordship.

674
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:10,879
Long live the Lord.

675
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:12,320
Please rise.

676
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,399
Have a seat.

677
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
Thank you, Your Lordship.

678
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:22,479
I can see

679
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:23,919
that you're the best of the best.

680
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,360
No matter

681
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,800
who gets to be the Prince Consort,

682
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,479
it'll be Youzhou's greatest blessing.

683
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,639
Your Lordship.

684
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,959
How would you like

685
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,679
to test us for the liberal arts test?

686
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:38,840
My first question.

687
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:40,600
In your opinion,

688
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:42,280
what is the most important thing

689
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:43,959
in this world?

690
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,537
(Yuchi Lie, the Heir of Lord of Beizhou)

691
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,639
Your Lordship.

692
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:51,919
In my opinion,

693
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,479
the most important thing is power.

694
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,560
One can only survive

695
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,879
with power.

696
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,320
That's expected
from the heir of Lord of Beizhou.

697
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,120
I heard that Beizhou
is good at the military.

698
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:01,639
You definitely

699
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,360
have the demeanor of Beizhou.

700
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,679
Please be seated.

701
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:07,199
Thank you, Your Lordship.

702
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:09,239
Your Lordship.

703
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,800
(Young Master of Wanjian Manor, Zeng Youliang)
I think that

704
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,959
the most significant thing

705
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,800
in the world is ambition.

706
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,159
The strong should
be firm about their ambitions

707
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:17,639
to be invincible.

708
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:20,719
You're from Wanjian Manor,

709
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,040
yet you have such a wise opinion
about politics, Mr. Zeng.

710
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,080
You're admirable indeed.

711
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:26,959
Please have a seat.

712
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:28,679
Thank you, Your Lordship.

713
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,439
Well.

714
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:33,199
How about you, Mr. Shan?

715
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,439
Your Lordship.

716
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,399
I believe

717
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,879
that power and ambition

718
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,719
are equally important in this world.

719
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:49,760
Is that all?

720
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,320
I hold similar reasons

721
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,479
as them.

722
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,399
Tiantong Chamber of Commerce
is the top chamber of commerce.

723
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:02,159
I can see that you're a person

724
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,879
who is agreeable and capable.

725
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:07,000
I know that I'm not capable enough

726
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,000
to be selected, Your Lordship.

727
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,439
Hence, I shall give up.

728
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,760
Please take account

729
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,560
of my gracious act, misters.

730
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,199
If you can do a business with me,

731
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,399
I'll be more than grateful.

732
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,959
I shall leave first.

733
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,560
Mr. Shan is purposeful indeed.

734
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,919
Prince Huang.

735
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,280
What do you think?

736
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:35,639
As I see it,

737
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,040
the Six States

738
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,639
emphasize the vision.

739
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:40,679
Those who prioritize a city

740
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,719
survive on the city.

741
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:44,560
Those who prioritize a state

742
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,560
are able to sense evolution.

743
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,000
And those who prioritize the world

744
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:51,879
can bless and rule the world.
