That's so many.

3
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,470
It's really pretty.

4
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,080
Try this.

5
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,060
This is a liquid tint.

6
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,220
But there's an oil coating so it's really moisturizing.

7
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,970
I don't have this color.

8
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,880
This is great.

9
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,280
What about me? What do you think would suit me?

10
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,149
-She's having fun.
-Your skin is warm tone so...

11
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,880
This is how you apply it, right?

[Episode 8]

13
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,510
Oh, Saena.

14
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,490
Congratulations on winning the grand award.

15
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,960
Oh. Thank you.

16
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,040
I knew it.

17
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,160
After all, you work so hard.

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,420
What do you mean by you knew it.

19
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,910
You've always

20
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,950
been working hard, right?

21
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,090
Hey.

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,380
I didn't work hard.

23
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,650
I was so damn busy. I just practiced a little and got the award.

24
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,300
I saw it just now.

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,170
You're working really hard...

27
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,520
What do you mean donating?

28
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,410
We are all friends.

29
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,360
Friends?

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,170
You call those pathetic people friends?

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,920
You beggar.

32
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,270
I helped you. You should be grateful.

33
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,020
You helped me?

34
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,610
How did you help me?

35
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,670
Hey.

36
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,880
Did I ask you to help me?

37
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,090
Besides,

38
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,130
is that your money?

39
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,039
You're just showing off with your parents' money.

40
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,580
Spit it out.

41
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,180
What?

42
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,780
From now on,

43
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,710
I won't show off anymore.

44
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,460
So spit out the scholarship

45
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,020
I gave you.

46
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,780
Hey.

47
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,550
You're so damn annoying.

48
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,900
Yes, that's the kind of person you are.

49
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,750
You just want those pitiful people in your eyes

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,610
to be trampled by you without knowing it. You wench.

51
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,670
What?

52
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,530
You can't spit it out?

53
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,750
You've taken all you should've taken and you still want to protect your pride it seems.

54
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,360
Yeah.

55
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,450
I can't spit out that money.

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,700
I don't want to be working part-time jobs all day long with no time for practice.

57
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,640
Why are you doing this when you know all of these damn well?

58
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,460
Hey.

59
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,010
If you're so good at reincarnation,

60
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,490
just shut your mouth and live with gratitude.

61
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,040
Do you think I chose my reincarnation?

62
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,840
I don't want to be born like this.

63
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,640
If you want to complain about money, go to your parents.

64
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,579
Why are you getting mad at me?

65
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,530
You're just like Cha Soobin.

66
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,740
I wanted to help you.

67
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,260
But why do you think only about yourselves? Darn it!

68
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,060

69
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,220

Darn it.

71
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Are you crazy?

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,540
You're the crazy one.

73
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,590
Moon Yeji.

74
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,890
You uploaded people like me onto the internet after taking money from them.

75
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,800
You're acting like a hero with people like me.

76
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,800
Daeun

77
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,250
What did you give me?

78
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,420
It was a letter.

79
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,490
Now I...

80
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,850
have nothing left.

81
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,790
What do you want to do trying so hard

82
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,210
to make all of these yours?

83
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,520
No matter what's going on around you,

84
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,280
you think you just have to stick a flag in it?

85
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,460
So?

86
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,890
Who's next to you now?

87
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,710
Cha Soobin?

88
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,340
No. It's Seonjae.

89
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,159
Forget it. Don't have it.

90
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,480
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,100
Cha Soobin...

92
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,580
is really funny.

93
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,950
Hello.

94
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,860
Moon Yeji's not here.

95
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,990
I'm here for you.

96
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,200
This is the place.

97
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,670
The place you stay in all day long.

98
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,180
Seems like there's nothing special.

99
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,310
I heard you transferred here because you got into trouble.

100
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,050
That's not the truth.

101
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,370
But you never mentioned the reason.

102
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,430
What does it have to do with you?

103
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,050
You're still not talking about it.

104
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,260
You passed.

105
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,830
I... like mint chocolate milk.

106
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,740
Especially when I'm enjoying the night breeze

107
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,410
and drinking in the playground.

108
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,250
I like Zelda, but I'm not good at it.

109
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,040
And I'm actually quite a bully.

110
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,640
I like singing, but I pretend I don't like it.

111
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,140
-Because I have bad memories about it–
-Hey.

112
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,540
How long do I have to hear that for?

113
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,730
Get out.

114
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,890
What I like

115
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,320
is what Moon Yeji likes too.

116
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,710
So try to like them.

117
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,820
I can ask you... for this favor right?

118
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,730
Idiot.

119
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,940
I rearranged the song

120
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,810
I gave you last time.

121
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,020
With a new arrangement.

122
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,120
Why? The one you showed me was good.

123
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,240
I just hope you can start over.

124
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,890
With me.

125
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,750
Yeji.

126
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,030
I was thinking... These should be enough for you to post it on the Internet, right?

127
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,380
Please leave.

128
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,170

138
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,780
Look at Moon Yeji's Instagram.

Whoa. Are they crazy?

140
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,300

-No, I think this one is better.
-This is it.

This is amazing.

You're really good.

But you're

167
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,870
included in this too.

168
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,650
Seems like you don't know your position either.

169
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,160
Cause you're an idiot.

170
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,300

[Two months later]

172
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,580
Hello.

173
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,090
I'm Moon Yeji, a sophomore in Korea Arts High School's Department of Applied Music.

174
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,760
Hello.

175
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,950
The winter break is coming.

176
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,770
So I'm going to try doing a live stream every day.

177
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,530
Actually, I've been quite depressed lately.

178
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,160
I'm like this even now.

179
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,720
But even if I want to get rid of this situation, I don't think I can do anything.

180
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,530
But recently, I've become interested in singing again.

181
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,060
So, If you can recommend me some indie music,

182
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,560
I'll cover a few songs on the spot.

183
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,890
Are we going to finally hear Moon Yeji sing?

184
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,320
