Hey.

Just because you're rich, you must think everyone's a poor thing, huh?

198
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,740
I don't know.

199
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,620
You said you would take care of him.

200
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,310
Don't you know nothing?

201
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,040
Besides,

202
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,650
every time he was having a hard time, I was the one who was always by his side.

203

I'm saying it wasn't you, but me.

204

But now,

205
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,520
he's not by your side, is he?

206
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,820
I shouldn't have asked you where he is.

Aren't I handsome?

213

Hello, Dad.

Can I ask you a favor?

221
