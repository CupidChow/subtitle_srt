00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,560
I'm going to confess...

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,300
To Da-eun.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,190
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,270
I like Da-eun.

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,850
No.

7
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,200
Don't!

[Episode 2]

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,960
Darn it.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,760
That was horrific.

[Yeji, are you asleep?]
[Are you really asleep?????]
[Moon Yeji!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]

Yeji.

[Yeji...]
[What exactly is love?]

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,790
What exactly is love?

[Yeji...]
[What exactly is love?]
[Nothing goes my way. Really.]
[Sobbing]

16
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,630
Nothing goes my way.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm the one who wants to cry.

18
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,870
I don't understand.

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,270
Why are you staring at it?

20
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,300
It's dazzling.

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,660
Why are you still the same?

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,550
Because today's weather is really nice.

23
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,310
It's pissing me off.

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,180
Da-eun.

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,330
Oh.

26
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,940
Yeji, hi.

27
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,690
What are you going to do after school today?

28
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,820
Me?

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,510
Well...

30
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,669
Shall we meet after school?

31
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,270
At the cafe in front of the school.

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,670
No.

33
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,540
I'm the only one who's the same.

34
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,060
Saena, did you buy new headphones?

35
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,790
The color is pretty.

36
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,370
Hey.

37
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,220
Did you call me?

38
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,990
Yeah.

39
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,070
These headphones' noise-cancelling function is awesome.

40
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,150
I couldn't hear anything outside.

41
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,630
-Really?
-Yeah.

42
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,660
-Always?
-Yeah.

43
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,410
It's really light.

44
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,870
It's great for practice.

45
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,290
I'll make an exception and let you use it.

46
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,760
How is it?

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,540
Ah. Ah. You couldn't hear me, right?

Seon Joohyuk, where are you?

50
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,680
Hurry up over here after you register your attendance.

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,920
Set off now.

52
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,340
Stop it, you guys.

53
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,130
Joohyuk,

54
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,620
take your time.

55
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,920
Yeji.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,480
What do you think

57
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,610
love is?

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,300
I don't know.

59
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,550
What is it?

60
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,800
Love...

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,260
is like fire.

62
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,300
Whenever I see Saena,

63
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,350
it sets a fire in my heart.

64
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,360
Me too.

65
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,000
You too?

66
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,990
But...

67
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,370
why?

68
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,970
I see. So that's your preference.

69
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,590
Guys.

70
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,010
Breaking news!

71
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,070
-What is it?
-What is it?

72
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,030
I heard Dongkyu signed with an agency.

73
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,560
Dongkyu?

74
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,050
He must have really signed with an agency.

75
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,920
-You even applied mousse on your hair.
-Where did you sign with?

76
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,590
What's going on?

77
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,450
Hey, Dongkyu.

78
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,640
Are you really going to debut?

79
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,840
Debut!

80
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,130
Don't tell me it's one of the big three agencies?

81
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,670
One of the big three agencies?

82
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,880
That would be insane.

83
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,420
It's a new agency.

84
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,120
They were looking for artists who look like me.

85
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,770
They found me through Moon Yeji's account.

86
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,570
They gave me a spot in a team that's about to debut.

87
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,210
I'm also going to debut soon.

88
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,830
Moon Yeji's influence is really something.

89
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,310
This is amazing.

90
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,890
-Can't you post my photo too?
-Me too. Me too.

91
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,770
Please put me on your social media account.

92
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,100
-Just once.
-Post mine first.

93
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,670
Post mine first.

94
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,640
Just once.

95
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,300
I asked first. Just once.

96
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,180
Please post just one photo of me.

97
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,720
Me too.

98
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,550
Everyone.

99
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,350
Go back to your seats.

100
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,470
Come on.

101
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,240
-I only want to have practical classes.
-I don't want to have class.

102
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,659
I don't want to have class.

103
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,740
Why did I

104
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,310
assume it was me?

105
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,990
I'm...

106
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,920
going to confess.

107
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,520
To Da-eun.

108
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,870
What?

109
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,880
Who?

110
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,380
So,

111
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,210
I need your help.

112
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,030
Post it on your social media account.

113
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,300
Post what?

114
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,630
A photo of Da-eun and me.

115
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,210
Say that we're officially a couple starting today.

116
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,570
Darn it.

117
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,700
I have to go.

118
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,460
And...

119
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,240
I don't accept such requests.

120
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,010
Yes, "adapt," right?

121
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,820
Yes.

122
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,960
This part

123
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,230
is "approach"

124
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,370
and "process and accept the change."

125
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,270
Through this...

126
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,780
Oh?

127
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,630
Da-eun.

128
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,920
Oh.

129
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,510
It's smudged here.

130
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,930
Yeji.

131
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,090
Thank you.

132
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,510
Wow, I've so many followers.

133
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,400
Moon Yeji's influence is amazing.

134
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,350
Gosh... he's at it again.

135
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,370
Can you go to school?

136
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,790
People will think you'd dropped out as soon as you transferred.

137
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,630
Seonjae.

138
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,030
I'm completely upgraded.

139
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,360
TenH's rookie development team contacted me!

140
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,600
What?

141
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,320
What-What's wrong?

142
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,120
What?

143
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,280
What's wrong?

144
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,130
Gosh, him and his temper.

145
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,790
Oh, Yeji.

146
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,100
What are you doing here?

147
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,240
Oh.

148
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,660
I have an appointment.

149
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,890
With whom?

150
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,160
Oh.

151
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,700
I was too clueless.

152
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,500
You two, have a cozy time together.

153
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,240
-It's not me.
-Huh?

154
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,610
Let's go.

155
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,940
Oh?

156
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,190
Hello.

157
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,990
What's going on?

158
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,010
I thought you said you had to leave.

159
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,060
Oh.

160
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,570
I asked her out.

161
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,280
You?

162
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,780
Why?

163
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,020
Well...

164
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,990
What's there to ask?

165
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,130
Let's go.

166
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,290
We're leaving.

167
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,800
We're preparing for the arts festival together.

168
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,630
The arts festival?

169
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,320
You've agreed to participate as a team?

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,800
Yes.

171
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,420
Gosh. I actually thought...

172
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,310
something's going on between you two.

173
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,920
Da-eun.

174
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,220
Why are you flustered?

175
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,350
I...

176
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,440
I'm working really hard

177
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,620
so that I can have all kinds of experiences with the person I like.

178
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,820
I'll get going.

179
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,200
Hey, Yeji.

180
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,250
Yeji.

181
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,050
Are you okay?

182
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,090
Can you wait for a while?

183
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,140
I'll be done soon.

184
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,580
Cha Soobin.

185
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,080
Act consistently.

186
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,820
Soobin.

187
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,720
Are you leaving?

188
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,780
No, let's go back in.

189
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,280
Yeji, be on your way.

190
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,180
It's over.

See you tomorrow.

194
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,960
Did you know?

195
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,160
I heard that Korea Institute of the Arts' campus is really beautiful.

They're close now?

197
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,290

You go first.

199
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,210
Hey, Yeji.

200
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,230
I'm not done yet.

201

Hello, sir!

You don't mind, right?

210
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,040
You all smoke anyway, right?

211
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,730
Yes.

212
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,290
It smells good.

213
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,380
As long as you choose me, I'm confident I can

214
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,910
give my all.

215
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,170
Wow, this year's players are interesting.

Why isn't Lee Dongkyu here?

225
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,560
Dongkyu went to TenH to sign his contract.

226
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,140
Wow, but it really takes just one opportunity to transform one's life.

227
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,560
Who would've thought Lee Dongkyu would be the first to become famous?

228
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,510

He thought he was casted by a rookie development team,

271
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,650

It was brief, but I...

290

I was really happy.

291
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,960
I've always only been ignored, but for the first time...

292
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,740
I thought I was valuable for the first time.
