We love you, Moon Yeji!

12
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,330
So pretty.

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,660
She has to be first place.

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,390
She's definitely first place.

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,070
I approve.

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,770
As expected of Moon Yeji.

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,680
So beautiful.

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,110
So beautiful.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,150
What's that sound?

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,930
So piercing.

21
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,750
By the way, that piano...

22
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,700
What? She's willing to get sponsored?

23
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,660
No. Gosh. Seriously.

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,610
Why?

25
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,289
I just told her to sit right next to me,

26
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:19,960
and that idiot ran away.

27
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,460
Gosh.

28
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,870
That uh... Moon Yeji?

29
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,890
-Yeah. -You can just

30
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,990
find a suitable candidate on her account.

31
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,780
She's basically a pimp.

32
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,780
Sort of.

33
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,400
She's quite funny.

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,940
She posted them after receiving money, yet she's still saying they're her friends.

35
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:37,240
How much do you think she receives?

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,030
10 million?

37
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,270
Or 20 million?

38
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,220
20 million?

39
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,770
Darn it.

40
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:46,259
-Really? -Really?

41
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,090
-Really? -Where did that sound come from?

42
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,530
You're really the worst.

43
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,360
Is that true?

44
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,720
Is that true?

45
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,700
Don't worry about that.

46
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,310
It's not the truth anyway.

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,830
I'm fine.

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,680
This is driving me crazy.

49
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,760
That's so immoral.

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,680
She's crazy for money.

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,970
-Does that make sense? -No.

52
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,200
Moon Yeji didn't do anything wrong.

53
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,110
You all know it's not like that.

54
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,660
I did take the money.

55
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,550
Did she say she took money?

56
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,430
What is she talking about?

57
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,820
So she really took money?

58
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,860
Is she crazy?

59
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,480
I didn't know she's this kind of person.

60
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,160
I didn't expect this to happen.

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,980
I just did what I could.

62
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,200
What are you talking about?

63
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,960
Moon Yeji.

64
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,940
Come with me.

65
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,410
So it's true.

66
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,510

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,510
No way.

72
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,560
No.

73
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,220
I really wanted to stay a little longer to practice.

74

As expected of our golden youngest.

94
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,720
We were streaming with Seon Joohyuk so the viewership was amazing.

95
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,610

You've improved a lot.

108

I don't want to burden everyone,

109
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,460
so I should at least work hard.

110

Look at this.

143

You're feeling dizzy, aren't you?

144
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,100
Bastard.

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,060

148
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,600

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,420
Someone made a deal with me.

156
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,100

She's crazy for money.

168
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,470
I tried to make another song.

169
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,770
These are the lyrics coming from deep inside me.

170
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,660
I mean, there are many stories in my heart.

171
