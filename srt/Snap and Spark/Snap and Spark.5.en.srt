You shouldn't have come to me saying this.

Isn't it the one you like?

185
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,870
Daeun.

186
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,370
Let's take a photo together.

187
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,900
Which middle school did you graduate from?

188
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,290
I went to Seoul Art Middle School.

189
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,010
Oh. You're an elite.

190
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,960
What's your major?

191
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,560
I major in piano.

192
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,790
I heard they aren't selecting many people majoring in piano.

193
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,550
You know him, right?

194
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,500
Cha Soobin.

195
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,220
He majors in piano too.

196
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,110
Hey, Cha Soobin.

197
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,040
Come here.

198
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,520
Daeun said she's a piano major.

199
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,880
Hello.

200
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,030
I know you too.

201
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,510
You're good at studying and playing piano.

202
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,990
We can prepare for college entrance exams together.

203
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,710
Come on.

204
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,950
You're comrades. Let's shake hands.

205
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,710
Do you want a picture?

206
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,760
Hey, Seon Joohyuk.

207
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,030
It looks better here.

208
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,920
Hurry up.

209
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,120
Right here.

210
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,480
Smile.

211
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,190
Smile.

212
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,250
Is that a crown?

213
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,940
To Yeji.

214
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,700
Yeji.

215
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,250
Thank you for talking to me.

216
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,210
I've been worried. That I wouldn't be able to make friends here.

217
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,100
-I saw an envelope from Daeun last time.
-Yeji. I'm Hansol from the Department of Applied Music.

218
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,120
-Hello, I'm Jisoo from Department of Applied Dance.
-I saw Miyeon's letter yesterday.

219
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,430
-Hello, I'm Minkyung from the next class.
-Last time, Hansol put something in your locker.

220
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,380
-Everyone was in your locker at night.
I saw something from Minkyeong in the locker.

221
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,110
-Five, six, seven, eight.
-Six, seven, eight.

222
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,770
Good.

223
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,000
What?

224
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,620
I think we did a good job.

225
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,800
It looks good.

226
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,070
Hey. You have to practice more.

227
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,610
No, you've improved a lot.

228
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,390
Hi, Yeji.

229
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,230
[Hi, Yeji. I am Saena from Department of Applied Dance]

230
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,250
I am Saena from Department of Applied Dance.

231
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,590
I saw Daeun put an envelope in your locker.

232
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,440
Can I ask you to put up a post for me?

233
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,190
I feel like I've become a target in class.

234
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,040
[Moon Yeji]

235
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,700
There seems to be something

236
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:52,880
[Help yourself!]

237
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,260
Help yourself.

238
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,540
-What is it? -I don't know.

239
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,280
I don't know.

240
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,590
Why is it pasted on Yeji's cabinet?

241
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,350
I don't know.

242
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,880
Gosh. Let's go.

243
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,450
[Why can Kim Daeun do it but not me?
How much did she give you?]

244
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,030
Why can Kim Daeun do it but not me?

245
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,160
How much did she give you?

246
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,720
[Moon Yeji]

247
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,160
You don't even know how I feel like living in hell everyday.

248
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,310
It's just posting up a photo for me. Is it that difficult?

249
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,650
Saena.

250
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,620
It's you, isn't it, Kang Saena?

251
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,430
The deal I struck with you.

252
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,960
A proof photo.

253
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,320
Don't forget our promise today.

254
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,490
This is for last time.

255
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,210
Thank you.
