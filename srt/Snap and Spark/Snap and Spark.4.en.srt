We're going to rearrange the song you recommended.

112
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,570
No.

113

We're going to slow down the tempo.

114
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,390
Start off as a ballad and then transition into jazz.

115
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,920
It's not easy to do that.

116
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,700
But do I even need to worry about our aces?

117

On the other hand, that team of Yeji and Seonjae is driving me nuts.

Did they get together while preparing for the arts festival?

124
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,290
That's why they say a guy and a girl can't be purely friends.

125
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,810
Do you agree with that?

126
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,120

144
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,800
Seonjae.

145
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,910
Let's do it.

146
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,410
No.

147
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,080
Let's just do it once.

148
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,410
I've mentally prepared myself before I came.

149
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,620
I don't think we're...

150
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,120
that close yet.

151
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,800
Why won't you do it?

152
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,440
I saw the homeroom teacher watching the video.

153
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,850
That was just the demo.

154
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,690
But if I'm the one composing and singing the song,

155
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,820
what will you do?

156
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,330
Hmm...

157
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,090
Write the lyrics?

158
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,720
Have you written lyrics before?

159
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,610
Isn't writing lyrics

160
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,660
ultimately about expressing your own feelings in words?

161
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,850
What I'm saying is I have many stories in my heart to tell.

162
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,030
Here.

163
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,090
Love.

164
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,880
It's a love story.

165
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,600
I'm perfect...

166
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,750
Hmm... but I can't get you.

167
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,610
You don't care about me.

168
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,650
You told me you like someone else.

169
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,160
The person you like...

170
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,460
is my friend.

171
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,670
Well, maybe you and I were just friends.

172
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,710
Yes.

173
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,660
It was my own wishful thinking.

174
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,410
You're just a considerate person.

175
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,510
I thought you liked me too.

176
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,080
You made me misunderstand the situation.

177
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,080
That's why I even confessed to you!

178
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,520
I've never confessed to anyone before.

179
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,160
I bet he can't hear me again.

180
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,870
A misunderstanding.

181
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,670
Sincerity.

182
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,410
Unbelievable.

183
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,840
It's Seon Joohyuk.

184
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,360
Who's Seon Joohyuk?

185
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,450
Don't you know him?

186
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,550
He made it into a debut group when he was in an ordinary high school,

187
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,630
and transferred to our school.

188
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,920
Oh, the applied dance major.

189
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,090
Is he a dance member?

190
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,170
No.

191
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,560
Then, a vocalist?

192
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,830
No way.

193
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,730
A rapper?

194
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,510
So he's the visual?

195
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,760
That's right.

196
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,390
He's the visual.

197
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,700
I

198
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,600
don't know that I'm handsome.

199
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,950
He's clearly much uglier than me.

200
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,050
No matter how I look at him,

201
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,700
he's ugly.

202
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,210
Really ugly.

203
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,570
Handsome guys are the best.

204
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,820
[She said handsome guys are the best]

205
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,950
She said handsome guys are the best.

206
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,010
[So I made sure to look my best before I came to school today]

207
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,920
So I made sure to look my best before I came to school today.

208
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,350
[You look pretty]

209
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,190
You look pretty.

210
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,110
I know that too.

211
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,200
[I know that too]

212
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,440
I have a pretty face and pretty hands.

213
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,750
Nothing about me is not pretty.

214
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,030
[I know that too
I have a pretty face and pretty hands
Nothing about me is not pretty]

215
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,460
[So why isn't it me?]

216
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,620
So why isn't it me?

217
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,630
[Am I not handsome?]

218
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,210
Am I not handsome?

220
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,710

[What Saena means by being handsome]

222
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,500
What Saena means by being handsome

223
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,220
is to have impressive skills.

224
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,350
That's what she means.

225
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,840
I don't need to just rely on my looks.

226
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,230
I want to be handsome with my skills too.

227
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,890
How did that guy with two left feet join the debut group?

228
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,870
Thanks to his looks.

229
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,290
Hey, turn off the lights when you leave.

230
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,110
I'm sorry but the lights will never be turned off.

231
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,370
[Note: "fire" and "light" are the same word in Korean.]

232
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,370
Just like how the fire in my heart will never be put out.

233
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,430
Choi Taejoon.

234
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,830
Seon Joohyuk.

235
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,580
You're so handsome.

236
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,480
Because of your face?

237
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,730
No. Because of your skills.

238
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,880
Seon Joohyuk, your dancing is so handsome.

239
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,010
It's nothing.

241
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,560
I really like you.

242
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,380
I said I had no choice.

243
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,790
I already apologized too.

244
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,890
Get out.

245
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,600
-So this is how Joo Seonjae ruins his reputation.
-Because of Joo Seonjae, Heo Sola's life is ruined.

246
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,550
I knew he'd turn out like this one day.

247
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,770
-He's utter trash.
-I knew it from the start.

248
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,610
-I feel so bad for Heo Sola.
-He's such a jerk.

249
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,460
That's good.

You need me.
