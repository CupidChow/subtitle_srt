00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,000
This series is purely a work of fiction

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,280
Do you need my help for this class?

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,520
I can help you pass.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,440
but in return, you have to help me with my work for one day.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,240
Okay.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,240
When you asked me to help,

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160
I didn't expect to have to carry so much stuff.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,840
Yu.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,880
Ice, this is Yu.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,440
He's ...

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,640
a photographer who has taken photos for me before.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,800
Are you okay these days?

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,760
P' Yu probably won't be coming back tonight.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,320
What do you mean?

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,920
Yo,

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,040
what happened? Tell me.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,840
Yo!!

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,000
P' Yu probably won't be coming back tonight.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,640
What do you mean?

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,920
(Please apologize to Ai for me,
I couldn't keep my promise.)

22
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,600
P' Yu!!!

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,160
Hey, why are you so shocked?

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,000
I saw you crying, why are you crying?

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,960
Look, the series is so sad.

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,920
Gene and Nubsib broke up.

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Oh my God, Yo.

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,560
Why are you so stressed about this?

29
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,880
Have you been starving or what?

30
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,480
Why are you yelling at me?

31
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,240
What? I can't criticize you now?

32
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,840
Hey, do you think P' Yu disappeared

33
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,640
because he had a fight with Panpan?

34
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,960
How do you know that?

35
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,160
Did P' Yu tell you?

36
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,120
Yeah, he told me when I was helping him with some work.

37
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,240
He said they fought about something related to the show.

38
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,200
Something about an old relationship or a new one, I don’t really know.

39
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,520
Or do you know something?

40
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,160
Oh,

41
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,920
after your birthday party,

42
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,400
I had to pee so I went outside to use the bathroom.

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,360
And suddenly I heard P' Yu arguing with Panpan.

44
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,960
Hey, I'm not being nosy.

45
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,720
But I heard them arguing loudly.

46
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,040
So I got curious and worried.

47
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,080
I wanted to know what they were fighting about.

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,360
(Why aren't you answering?)

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,960
(Why are you silent?)

50
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,120
(It's not related, Pan.)

51
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,840
(Hey, wait a minute, Pan.)

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,120
(We still need to talk about this.)

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,960
Oh, Yo.

54
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,280
I'm heading home now.

55
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,520
Ok.

56
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,240
Pan!

57
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,600
Aren't you worried about P' Yu?

58
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,320
I think we should go look for him.

59
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,960
No need, P' Yu will be back by tomorrow.

60
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,920
He always acts like this when he's overthinking.

61
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,400
You've seen this before, right?

62
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,560
But this time, it's different.

63
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,360
How so?

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,040
Ugh.

65
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,920
Well, maybe it's not so different.

66
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,680
Have you ever seen P' Yu break up with someone?

67
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,680
As far as I know,

68
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,720
Panpan is P' Yu's first girlfriend, right?

69
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,240
How are we supposed to know

70
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
where P' Yu is?

71
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,240
Oh, I think I got it.

72
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,080
Hey, hi.

73
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,680
Hi.

74
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,320
Hello.

75
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,040
(Ai: I just entered the wardrobe room.)

76
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,440
(Ai: I can't find Panpan.)

77
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,160
(Ing: I haven't found her either.)

78
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,720
(Yo: Yeah, me neither.)

79
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,400
Are you the wardrobe assistant?

80
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,400
Yes.

81
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,800
Can you please bring P' Ice's and P' Pan's shoes
to the set right now?

82
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,600
Why are you just standing there?

83
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
They're about to start filming, I need them now.

84
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,520
Uh, okay.

85
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,320
Alright.

86
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,160
Hold on a second.

87
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,560
Well?

88
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,520
Yes.

89
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,080
Can you?

90
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,480
If you can find it, then follow me.

91
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,360
Uh...

92
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,600
Well? Do you have it?

93
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,800
Yes.

94
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,920
Okay.

95
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,800
Go ahead.

96
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,440
They're about to start, hurry.

97
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,120
Go in.

98
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,400
Hey,

99
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,840
these aren't my shoes.

100
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,560
Did you grab the right pair?

101
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,720
Did you bring the wrong shoes?

102
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
Which pair is it, then?

103
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,960
I'll get someone else to bring them.

104
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,360
Answer when you're asked.

105
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,760
Are we going to shoot today or not?

106
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,160
I need the wardrobe team on set now.

107
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,280
Hey?

108
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,600
What's going on, Opal?

109
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,040
The assistant brought the wrong shoes.

110
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,960
I asked him something, and he didn't respond.

111
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,440
Opal, I only have one assistant and we were just making papaya salad.

112
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,280
Who are you?

113
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,520
Hey?

114
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
Hey, you?

115
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,720
Ai.

116
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Why are you doing things like this?

117
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,040
If the film crew catches you and you don't find me first.

118
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,200
What if they caught you and sent you to the police?

119
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,480
I'm sorry,

120
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,680
but we just wanted to talk to you.

121
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,440
I called, but you didn't answer.

122
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,800
I texted, but you didn't reply.

123
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
If you want to talk about Yu,

124
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm not ready to discuss it right now.

125
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,880
We can't wait.

126
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,080
It's urgent.

127
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,520
What do you mean?

128
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,880
Has something happened, Ai?

129
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,960
P' Yu is missing.

130
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,840
Didn't you know?

131
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,680
Uh.. the truth is

132
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,960
I've broken up with Yu for quite some time time.

133
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,560
Then can I ask you one last question?

134
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,200
What is it?

135
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,480
Did you and P' Yu ever go to the ocean together?

136
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,200
Um...

137
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
I've never been to the sea with Yu.

138
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,400
Why are you asking?

139
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,120
Oh, it's nothing.

140
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,000
Sorry for bothering you.

141
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,280
It's ok.

142
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,200
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,680
Do you think...

144
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,040
P' Yu is ok?

145
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Hey, don't go thinking about that yet.

146
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,600
Why did you ask P' Pan about the sea?

147
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,720
Never mind.

148
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,680
Have you ever gone to the sea with P' Yu?

149
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,200
Yeah, I have.

150
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,600
I went to Jeju Island, Bali, and the Maldives.

151
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,320
Oh, this is hard.

152
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,400
Nami, Hokkaido, Hawaii.

153
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,000
Wait, you've been to all those places?

154
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,720
No, I just want to go.

155
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Damn it, I'm being serious here.

156
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,360
Hey, I think I know one place.

157
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,840
Hold on.

158
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,800
Ai, did you dream about P' Yu being at the sea?

159
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,800
Hey, how did you know?

160
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,280
You always come to this conclusion.

161
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,800
Hey, here it is! Here it is!

162
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,400
I found it.

163
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,920
Where is that?

164
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,840
It's here.

165
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,960
How do you know it's here?

166
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,960
Oh, just look at the picture, it's the same.

167
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,200
That's not what I meant.

168
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,560
I mean, how do you know P' Yu is here?

169
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,160
Well, if P' Yu isn't here, then I don't know where else he could be.

170
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,480
Because this is the place that...

171
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,160
I think we should find P' Yu first.

172
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,240
It’s getting late.

173
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,440
Let’s go.

174
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,400
Over there, right?

175
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,600
Yeah, let’s check it out first.

176
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,400
It looks similar, right?

177
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,160
Yeah.

178
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,360
Is there another spot like this?

179
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,640
I don't think so.

180
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,560
It should end here.

181
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,600
Or should we try over there?

182
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,560
Yeah, let's give it a try.

183
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,080
Try again.

184
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,640
Um.

185
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,120
What should we do?

186
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,240
What should we do?

187
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,440
Yeah, Which way should we go?

188
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,280
Or should we try that way?

189
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,680
Oh.

190
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Then let's play rock-paper-scissors.

191
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,360
Whoever loses goes that way.

192
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,520
Come on.

193
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,040
Okay.

194
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,560
Alright, come on.

195
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,280
Rock-paper-scissors.

196
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,760
Alright, I'm going that way.

197
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,800
Follow me.

198
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,440
I think we should go to the reception.

199
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,240
Yeah, let’s go.

200
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,080
Hello.

201
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,040
Hi.

202
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,480
How can I help you?

203
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,480
I wanted to ask if you’ve seen this man before.

204
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Hmm... no, I haven’t.

205
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,560
You've never seen him?

206
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,680
Yes.

207
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,640
Is there something wrong?

208
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,080
No, nothing.

209
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,280
Thank you.

210
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,080
Thank you.

211
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,520
I think we should go look outside.

212
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,880
Yeah.

213
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
We can't find him anywhere.

214
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,080
What do we do, Ai?

215
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,120
I don’t know.

216
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,600
P' Yu.

217
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,600
P' Yu.

218
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,360
P' Yu.

219
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,600
P' Yu!

220
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,720
Hey, Ai, where are you going?

221
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,840
P' Yu.

222
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,680
P' Yu.

223
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,840
P' Yu, what are you doing there?

224
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,560
Oh, Ai.

225
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,560
Hey.

226
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,840
P' Yu.

227
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,960
Hey, Ai.

228
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,280
Go.
