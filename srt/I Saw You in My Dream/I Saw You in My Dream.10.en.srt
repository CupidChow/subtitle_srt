00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,840
This series is purely a work of fiction,

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,000
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,880
I’m just worried about how they’ll feel.

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,160
Do we have to keep talking like this in secret forever?

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,480
I want to sleep with Yo.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,360
But you two are friends!

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,360
We’re together now.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
I’ve got a boyfriend to take care of me.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,080
Huh? A boyfriend?

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,800
Yeah, he’s standing right here.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,040
If I had to be disappointed in something about you...

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,360
I'm disappointed that you didn’t trust us,

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
and kept this from us.

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
What are you doing?

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,880
Ai.

16
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,840
No.

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,640
Ai, come out.

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,800
No.

19
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Don't.

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,680
P' Yu.

21
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,080
P' Yu.

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,400
No, get out.

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,120
Get out.

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,880
Come out and talk to me.

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you shy?

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,440
You’re not as bold as you were last night.

27
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,440
P’ Yu!

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,040
Come here.

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,760
Don’t touch!

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,320
Give it here.

31
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
It’s mine.

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,520
My pillow.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,000
P’ Yu!

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,720
P’ Yu, let go!

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,480
P’ Yu!

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,800
What do you want to eat today? I’ll cook for you.

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,200
What do I want to eat today?

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,920
Umm.

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
I want to eat...

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,080
Ai.

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,080
Can I?

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,400
What? You perv!
Ow, stop!

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,960
You perv!

44
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,720
Ai.

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Ai, stop.

46
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,840
where are you going?

47
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,840
Going to shower.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,920
Let me join!

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,720
(Hey Yu, it's at 10 AM today, right?)

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,040
Yes, yes, got it.

51
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,440
(Are you okay, though?)

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,120
I'm fine, it was a long time ago.

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,360
See you there.

54
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,320
P’ Yu,

55
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,400
are you showering or not?

56
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,480
If you are, hurry up and come!

57
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Shower time!

58
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,240
Quickly.

59
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,840
Oh, Yu!

60
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,160
Hi, Pan.

61
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,160
I just found out...

62
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,520
that you’re the photographer for this gig.

63
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,560
How have you been?

64
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,920
I’ve been good.

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
So...

66
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,400
How about you?

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,760
I’m good too.

68
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,960
A bit busy with work these days.

69
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,120
A bit busy with work these days.

70
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,960
You’re getting famous now, aren’t you?

71
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,120
Not as famous as Yu, a renowned photographer…

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,800
Really?

73
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,280
Yeah.

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,000
So, what are you doing after this?

75
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Probably just going home.

76
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,280
What about you, Pan?

77
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,920
I’ll probably head home too.

78
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,160
Let’s push through today!

79
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,520
You’ve got this.

80
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
You must have a lot of work lately, right?

81
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,560
Oh, Ice,

82
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,960
Can I check your muscle definition really quickly?

83
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,560
It’s not as sharp as I thought.

84
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Let me call makeup to touch it up.

85
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,480
Makeup!

86
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,040
Yu,

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,720
can we chat after we wrap up today?

88
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,600
Sure, what’s up?

89
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,000
We’ll talk later.

90
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,000
Really good,

91
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,720
That's great.

92
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,680
Pan, looking great.

93
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,800
Let’s try changing the pose.

94
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,120
Ok.

95
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,480
Very pretty.

96
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,320
Pan, smiles a little.

97
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,640
Pan.

98
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,040
Keep going?

99
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,600
Go ahead.

100
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,120
Hey!

101
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,960
Hey!

102
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
What's going on?

103
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,720
The client wants a lover's vibe.

104
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
Just following the brief.

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,800
What’s wrong with you?

106
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,520
That was a bit much for the brief, wasn’t it?

107
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Yu, it’s okay, I'm fine.

108
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,400
What's going on?

109
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,440
What's going on?

110
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,160
I swear I didn’t do anything.

111
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,600
I promise,

112
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,400
I’m not that kind of person.

113
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,800
Didn’t do what?

114
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
I just saw you cross the line beyond the brief.

115
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,640
I was just doing my job. Why are you getting involved?

116
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
I know why you’re acting like this.

117
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,640
It’s because you used to date Pan,

118
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,400
so now you’re mixing personal issues with work, right?

119
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,320
That’s not the case at all!

120
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
What you did...

121
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,560
was borderline harassment, man.

122
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,080
Harassment?

123
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,680
Yeah!

124
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,480
Don't you know?

125
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,400
Calm down, everyone.

126
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,200
I think we’re not getting anywhere with this conversation.

127
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,000
Ice, Yu, go outside for now.

128
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,040
I want to speak with Pan alone.

129
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,080
But I think this...

130
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,600
Ice.

131
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,360
Yes.

132
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Pan, are you okay?

133
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,240
Yes.

134
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,800
Can you please talk to Pan for me?

135
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,880
(No, it’s too big of a deal)

136
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,680
(Then bye,)

137
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
(go deal with it yourself.)

138
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,680
Hey, wait!

139
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,200
Hey.

140
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,680
Thank you.

141
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,640
What did P’Gob say?

142
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,760
P’Gob said she’d handle it.

143
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Right now,

144
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,560
Ice has been dropped from being a brand ambassador,

145
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,760
but our company doesn’t know what to do next.

146
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,520
How long has this been going on?

147
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,400
For a while now, Yu.

148
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,800
Yu...

149
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,560
If I tell you something,

150
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,560
can you promise not to tell anyone?

151
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,480
Before this, Ice confessed his love to me,

152
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,240
but I rejected him.

153
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,240
After that, I felt like someone’s

154
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,320
been following me all the time.

155
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,240
And it was Ice?

156
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,360
I’m not 100% sure,

157
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,880
but...

158
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,240
I think so.

159
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,520
Let’s go report this to the police.

160
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,760
Yu, no.

161
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,880
I don’t want to make this a big deal,

162
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,080
especially with the contracts involved.

163
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,280
I could get sued, Yu.

164
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,160
So what should we do now?

165
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,880
I don’t know.

166
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,720
But right now,

167
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,760
I’m really scared, Yu.

168
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,480
I’m scared that if I go back,

169
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,880
I’ll find him waiting for me.

170
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,680
What should I do, Yu?

171
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,960
You can stay here for now.

172
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,880
Maybe things will get better.

173
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,200
It’s going to be okay.

174
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,760
Thank you, Yu.

175
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,840
Mom’s calling us to eat.

176
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,840
Time to eat.

177
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,480
Mom, why’s there so much food today?

178
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Well, we need to fatten you up a bit!

179
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,120
You’ve got your competition tomorrow.

180
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Alright, help me too,

181
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Put it on the grill.

182
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
I’ll grill some for Dad too.

183
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,720
The weather’s so nice today, let’s eat outside.

184
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,160
Go on, keep grilling.

185
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,160
What’s wrong?

186
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,000
You’re not having those dreams again, right?

187
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,320
No,

188
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,120
everything’s real this time.

189
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,720
Alright, everyone,

190
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,000
Mom, Dad,

191
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,920
today I’ve invited Panpan to join us for dinner.

192
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,160
Hello.
Hello.

193
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,720
Of course, there’s plenty of food, sit.

194
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Thank you.
Thank you.

195
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,720
Let’s eat, Mom!

196
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,320
Turn up the heat for me.

197
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,200
Oh, this looks delicious.

198
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,240
Go ahead, take some first.

199
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,480
Okay. Thank you.

200
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,000
Ok.

201
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,960
Are you sure you don’t want some first?

202
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,880
No, you go ahead!

203
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,760
I’ll boil some for you.

204
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,000
Mussels are ready to serve!

205
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,280
Here they come!

206
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,360
(Ice.)

207
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,840
(Ice: I saw everything, Pan. You’re with him, aren’t you?)

208
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,520
(Ice: If you don’t respond, you’ll see me soon.)

209
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,720
They’re hot.

210
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,000
Pan?

211
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,720
Pan?

212
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,880
Yeah.

213
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,680
I’ll rinse it with plain water first.

214
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,440
Here.

215
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,680
Are you still mad at me about Panpan?

216
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,120
Why would I be mad at you?

217
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,080
If you and P' Panpan didn’t have anything going on.

218
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,680
Pan just...

219
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,920
ran into some trouble.

220
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,360
What trouble?

221
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,200
I can’t tell you yet.

222
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,040
I promised Pan.

223
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,600
But there’s really nothing going on between me and Pan.

224
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,440
We’re just friends, I swear.

225
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,720
Right here?

226
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,440
Why not? Right here, it’s fine.

227
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,800
No.

228
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,920
Why not? What are you afraid of?

229
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,880
There’s no one here.

230
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,320
P' Yu, let’s eat some grapes.

231
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,800
P' Yu!

232
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,520
(Ai)

233
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,840
(Ai, honey)

234
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,440
Wake up.

235
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,520
You can sleep anywhere, can’t you?

236
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,040
Huh?

237
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,000
Seriously, the moment the wheels start moving,

238
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
you’re out like a light.

239
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,000
Just like your mom when she was young!

240
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,600
Come on, hurry up, or there won’t be any seats left.

241
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,800
Quickly!

242
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,960
I’m so excited!

243
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,520
It’s been so long since we’ve watched Yo compete.

244
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,920
It’s such a shame Yu couldn’t make it.

245
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,960
He said he had to fix some project or something.

246
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,760
He has to stay with Pan...

247
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,960
Oh wow!

248
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,680
How long has it been since...

249
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,080
we’ve seen the campus like this, Mom?

250
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,480
How many years has it been?

251
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,440
The last time we came here together...

252
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,960
was for Yu’s graduation.

253
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,400
Alright, enough of that.

254
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Let’s just focus on the competition.

255
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,040
Go for it!

256
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,320
Yo, go for it!

257
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,160
Go for it!

258
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,360
Yo, go for it!

259
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,960
You’ve got this!

260
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,840
Here we go, here we go!

261
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,000
0-0. Team A starts the serve.

262
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,640
1-0.

263
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,760
Great job!

264
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,920
Feels like I’m the one competing!

265
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,640
It’s so exciting to watch.

266
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Match point, Yo, it’s match point!

267
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,640
21-19. Team A wins.

268
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,760
It’s because you ate at our house!

269
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,600
Whoa, you’re cheering pretty loud.

270
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,560
Afraid people won’t know you’re a couple or something?

271
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,280
I’m just setting the mood for you and your parents!

272
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,080
Oh, really?

273
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,080
See? It worked.

274
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,360
How about that?

275
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,360
Yo!

276
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:54,880
Oh,

277
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,280
you came?

278
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,520
Yo, you were awesome today!

279
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,280
Thanks.

280
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Hey, why are you giving me this?

281
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,680
I heard you kept saying you wanted it,

282
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,640
so I bought it for you.

283
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,080
Thank you, but...

284
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,760
No, it’s okay.

285
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,760
I feel bad.

286
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,600
Alright, I’ll get going then.

287
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,680
Wait, Yo.

288
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,160
There’s something I wanted to talk to you about.

289
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Do you think it’s possible,

290
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
for the two of us to…

291
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,320
I mean, I…

292
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,920
I know it makes you uncomfortable.

293
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,280
At the time, I just wanted to be sure,

294
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,320
so I said what I said.

295
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,880
But now, I think I can give you time.

296
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,600
We can take it slow.

297
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,440
No, Peach, it’s not that.

298
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,520
It's just that I...

299
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,560
You and I have the same conflict here.

300
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,760
So, what are you going to do next?

301
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Hey, Ing!

302
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,160
Ing, wait!

303
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,280
Ing!

304
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,440
Oh, Ing!

305
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,360
I’m not single anymore.

306
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,680
Ing and I are dating, Peach.

307
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,400
I get it now.

308
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,240
Congratulations.

309
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,560
I’d better go.

310
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
See you around.

311
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,040
I’m sorry. I should’ve trusted you more.

312
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,880
I get it.

313
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
I haven’t exactly been the best either.

314
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,360
But I’m glad, you know, that you were jealous of me.

315
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,480
Well, I'm your boyfriend.

316
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Oh, here you all are.

317
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,800
I thought you’d disappeared.

318
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,720
I came out of the bathroom and couldn’t find you.

319
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,760
I’m right here, just hanging out.

320
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
Oh, let’s take a picture together!

321
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,360
Let’s take a picture, everyone, come on!

322
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,920
Come on!

323
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,760
Alright, look at the camera.

324
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,440
One...Two...Three!

325
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,400
Hey, Ai, don’t space out,

326
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,760
you’ll end up cutting yourself with the knife.

327
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,120
Hmm.

328
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,960
Are you overthinking about P’ Yu?

329
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,800
How did you know?

330
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,760
It’s pretty obvious.

331
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,440
You've had that scowl on your face since last night.

332
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,320
Come on, tell me everything.

333
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,640
Well, Mom, your goody two shoes isn’t telling me anything.

334
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,920
He only said that P’ Panpan’s in some kind of trouble.

335
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,920
And it’s like P’ Panpan doesn’t even know

336
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,640
that I’m dating P’ Yu.

337
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
How can I not be worried?

338
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,080
I’m not saying you’re overthinking.

339
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,160
You just did!

340
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,560
Look at Yo!

341
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,200
He’s brave enough to tell everyone that Ing is his boyfriend.

342
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
So why can’t P’ Yu...

343
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,920
Why don’t you tell him, Ai?

344
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,680
Tell him how you feel.

345
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
I just haven’t had the chance yet.

346
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,480
I don’t even know how to say it.

347
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,280
Maybe P’ Yu hasn’t had the chance either.

348
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Give him some time, Ai.

349
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,480
What’s up with you now?

350
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
What are you cuddling for?

351
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,360
I’m tired today.

352
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,240
Can I cuddle a little?

353
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,520
Hey...

354
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,440
Can I have more?

355
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,760
I’m starting to like it.

356
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Mom, Ai, come here quickly!

357
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,640
Huh? What’s up?

358
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,600
What’s going on, Dad?

359
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,840
What’s up?

360
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,400
Look at the news!

361
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,680
Look!

362
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,840
(Another big news story, folks!)

363
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,640
(The rising star from the reality show "Romance 101")

364
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,400
(sadly posted on his story,)

365
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,160
(about being cheated on by Panpan!)

366
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,520
(Ooh, it’s intense!)

367
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,000
(A sneaky person took a photo of Panpan with a mystery guy,)

368
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,520
(and posted it on Twitter or X!)

369
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,840
(It’s now the hottest topic online,)

370
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,680
(spreading like wildfire.)

371
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,040
(And we have the picture in question right here!)

372
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,720
(Here you can see.)

373
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,320
(Sources tell me that this mystery guy,)

374
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,880
(was once Panpan’s boyfriend.)

375
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,360
(I think this old flame is ready to reignite!)

376
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,120
(But oh, the plot thickens!)

377
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,640
(This mystery guy is now,)

378
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,640
(supposedly dating a no-name college student.)

379
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,960
(How tangled is this love triangle going to get?)

380
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,120
(Well, let’s stay tuned for more updates!)

381
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,080
What in the world is this?
(If there are any new updates,)

382
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,440
(I’ll be sure to share all the juicy details.)

383
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,320
I don’t get it.

384
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,840
How did this even happen?
