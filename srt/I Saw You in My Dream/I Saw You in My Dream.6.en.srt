00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,160
This series is purely a work of fiction

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,000
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,920
I think you should stop looking for a dream.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,840
Try looking at yourself instead.

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,000
I think you might discover something special about yourself.

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,560
Who gave you a ride?

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,360
I want to go for a holiday somewhere.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,400
Can you go with me?

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,200
Please?

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,880
Uh.. Fine.

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,360
(Koh Island - Emerald Cave)

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,800
What are you doing?

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,320
Going on a trip?

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,520
Who are you inviting?

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,800
Well, we haven’t traveled together in a while,

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,880
so I thought I’d invite...

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,760
Invite who?

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,560
I’m inviting you, of course.

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,160
And Ai, and...

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,440
Everyone, actually.

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,000
You invited Ai?

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,160
Take Ing with us too,

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,960
so it’s all of us.

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,040
No way.

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Haven’t found a place yet? Let me handle it.

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,920
I’ve got a place in mind.

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,240
There’s a lot to do there, you know?

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,440
If the four of us go, it’ll be so much fun.

29
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,280
P’ Yu...

30
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,760
Ai...

31
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,440
P’ Yu...

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,920
Are you okay?

33
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
Where is P’ Yu?

34
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,720
Everyone's already gone down,

35
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,600
and here you are, drooling in your sleep.

36
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,800
Hey.

37
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,720
Wait for me, Ai.

38
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,240
Wait.

39
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,240
Wait for me.

40
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,000
Yo, where's P' Yu?

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,160
Oh, he just arrived.

42
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,880
Surprise!

43
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,600
Hello, Ai.

44
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,920
P' Wann, hi.

45
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Surprised, huh?

46
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,520
P' Waan is the owner here.

47
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Super rich.

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,520
He owns thousands of rai of land.

49
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,880
Yo, Where's P' Yu?

50
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,520
Where's P' Yu?

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,680
P' Yu walked over there, not sure where.

52
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,640
Uh.

53
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,960
Where is he rushing to?

54
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,040
Ai.

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,360
What's up with Ai?

56
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,040
Not sure, let's go first.

57
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,000
Alright, let's go.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,520
Hello.

59
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,360
Come on.

60
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,360
What?

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,960
P'  Yu.

62
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,920
P'  Yu.

63
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,480
P' Yu, give me the bag, I'll carry it myself.

64
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
It's fine, I'll carry it for you.

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,120
No, I'll carry it myself.

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,880
It's okay, I'll carry it for you.

67
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,440
P' Yu, I said I'll carry it myself.

68
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,800
It's heavy, let me carry it.

69
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,400
No, I'll carry it myself.

70
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,320
Did you trip over your own bag?

71
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,640
And you're laughing instead of helping.

72
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,160
Okay, okay, sorry.

73
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,520
You're so playful, huh?

74
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,400
How's that?

75
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,000
Did it hurt?

76
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,200
What are you doing, Ai?

77
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,560
Why am I to blame?

78
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,520
You made me fall.

79
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,720
What’s going on here?

80
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,320
P' Yu was teasing me.

81
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,840
It's all dirty now, get up.

82
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,000
I teased you?

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,520
Yeah.

84
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,240
Better apologize.

85
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,800
P' Yu.

86
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,480
P' Yu.

87
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,640
P' Yu.

88
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,560
Can you get up?

89
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,480
Ow.

90
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,200
Can you slowly get up?

91
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,560
Ow.

92
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,000
Ow.

93
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,760
Ai.

94
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,200
I dreamed that...

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,520
I knew it.

96
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,640
I dreamed that P' Yu fell and hit his head.

97
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
But you just tripped and fell, didn’t you?

98
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,840
Exactly.

99
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,000
Every time I help P' Yu,

100
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,160
I end up getting hurt instead.

101
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,360
Remember that show you played for me?

102
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,640
The one where the grandpa saved the grandma before the gas explosion,

103
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,240
and he died instead of her.

104
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,400
But there were two times when I dreamed that P' Yu didn't get hurt.

105
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,320
The first time was when I fell from the Christmas tree.

106
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,440
And the other time was the other day when the lights went out,

107
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,520
and I got scared and threw a pillow at P' Yu.

108
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,520
But aside from those times, that's it.

109
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,920
When the event happens, P' Yu gets hurt, right?

110
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,400
Yeah.

111
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,240
I caused it myself.

112
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,360
Maybe you didn't see it in the dream because you woke up before it happened?

113
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,160
Huh?

114
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,200
Oh.

115
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,880
Hey.

116
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,360
How are you?

117
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,640
I'm okay.

118
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,120
Yeah, it's all good.

119
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,360
Hey, should we go to the market, everyone?

120
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,400
In case we want to buy something to cook for dinner tonight.

121
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,400
I think we should hurry, otherwise, the market will close.

122
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's go.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,720
Yeah, let's go.

124
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,680
Let's go.

125
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
(Oh Poi Market)

126
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
Hey, I want to get ice cream from this shop.

127
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,160
Okay.

128
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,080
Hey, P' Yu, wait a second, come here.

129
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,560
What's up?

130
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,120
I forgot my wallet,

131
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,240
but I want ice cream.

132
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,200
Can you buy some for me?

133
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
Why don’t you borrow from me first?

134
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Come on, we’re all buying together.

135
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,400
One chocolate,

136
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,760
one lime, and one coconut, please.

137
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,120
You eat a lot.

138
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
I bought them for you guys, one each.

139
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,960
Want anything else?

140
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,400
Hey, where's P' Yu going?

141
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
Follow me when you're done.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,720
Wait, P' Yu!

143
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,560
Hey, wait.

144
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
You haven't even gotten your ice cream yet, where are you going?

145
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,120
You invited me to eat, so you have to wait.

146
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,520
Ai, you seem to really like sweets.

147
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,480
Everything looks so good, doesn't it?

148
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,120
But I can't decide what to choose.

149
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,160
Have you tried this one before?

150
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Hmm... no, I haven't.

151
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,320
I will buy it for you.

152
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,320
Hello, one portion of sesame rice dessert, please.

153
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,600
Thank you.

154
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,680
Wow, bought so many things.

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,680
Alright, let me feed you.

156
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Hmm, it's delicious.

157
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,400
That's great, P'Waan.

158
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,000
So, do you know what it's made from?

159
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,120
No idea, but it's really good.

160
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,440
This is called sesame rice dessert.

161
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,280
It's made from sticky rice that's steamed,

162
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,240
and then pounded together with sesame seeds, like those over there.

163
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,080
Hmm.

164
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Shall we go have a look over there?

165
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,480
Sure.

166
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,920
Want me to carry this for you?

167
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,320
Come on.
No, it's okay.

168
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,720
Can I get a slice of pizza?

169
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,520
Sure.

170
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,760
Thank you.

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,280
It's all over your mouth.

172
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,960
Thank you.

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,280
Hey, do you guys want to something fun?

174
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,960
Sure.

175
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,200
Uh, truth or dare?

176
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:52,880
Hmm.

177
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,200
Alright, if you ask and can't answer, you have to take a shot.

178
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,880
But if you dare and don't do it, you have to finish your drink.

179
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,560
Sounds fun, let's do it.

180
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,040
Who said I was going to play?

181
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,480
Come on, we don't get together like this often.

182
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
If you get drunk, we'll take care of you.

183
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,120
Hurry up, let's go.

184
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,720
Come on.

185
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,480
Okay, here we go.

186
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,800
Whoever the arrow points to first, they're up.

187
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,400
Umm.

188
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,880
Let's go.

189
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,680
Who?

190
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,000
There it is.

191
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
(Ai.)

192
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,200
Got hit right away.

193
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,040
Yo, admit it, you're messing with me, aren't you?

194
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,000
Nope.

195
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,800
What's it gonna be, truth or dare?

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,720
Truth.

197
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,000
Alright, let me spin to see who's asking you.

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,520
Umm.

199
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,680
As long as it's not you.

200
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,800
(Ing.)

201
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,480
If you go easy on him or help him, you have to finish your drink.

202
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,560
I know.

203
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,240
Ask.

204
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,720
Then let me ask you.

205
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,240
Um.

206
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,000
The most embarrassing thing that you haven't told anyone yet.

207
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,880
If it's embarrassing, should I really tell it?

208
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, it's a question.

209
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,960
Drink up, if you don't tell.

210
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,120
Fine, I'll tell.

211
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,280
It must be like this.

212
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,360
It must be like this!

213
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,480
So, about two months ago,

214
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,400
I went out to eat, right?

215
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,560
And that day, it was raining really hard.

216
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,440
So, I was going up the pedestrian bridge,

217
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,280
and while I was going up, I tripped on the stairs.

218
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,440
And my flip-flop drifted off.

219
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Don't tell me...

220
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,640
Yeah, it flew right into a crowd of people waiting for the bus.

221
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,000
When I went to pick it up, I was both hurt and embarrassed.

222
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,080
When I went down, I fell in this position.

223
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,160
Whoa, whoa, stop.

224
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,280
Clam down.

225
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,520
Oh man, that almost hit my face.

226
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,360
You've been clumsy since you were a kid, huh?

227
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,160
Is it my turn?

228
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,840
Yeah.

229
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,560
I hope it lands on you, Yo.

230
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,160
Bring it on, I'm not afraid.

231
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,480
(Yo)

232
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,400
Hmm, here you go.

233
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,480
What do you want to ask?

234
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,280
Just pick something.

235
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,880
I'll choose dare.

236
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,800
Alright, I'll randomize it.

237
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,600
(Ai)

238
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,160
Yes!

239
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,440
Why does it have to be you?

240
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,480
It's serves you right.

241
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,640
Give a kiss on the head to the person across from you.

242
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
Hey, Ai!

243
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,680
Let's do it.

244
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,280
What?

245
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,080
Come on, hurry up, stop stalling.

246
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,760
Hurry up.
No.

247
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,200
Hurry, it's just a game.

248
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,000
Hurry up, Ing.

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,760
You guys wanted to play this yourselves.

250
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,080
I don't want to do.

251
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,840
Ing, Yo! Ing, Yo! Ing, Yo!

252
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,280
Hurry up.

253
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,840
Come on.

254
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,600
Yay, that's it.

255
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,360
I'll give you a bonus.

256
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,280
Hey, Yo!

257
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
It's supposed to be just one kiss.

258
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,040
Well, I'm giving a bonus because we're best friends, right?

259
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,680
Just you wait.

260
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,400
Shall we continue the game?

261
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,080
Come on.

262
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,600
Ai.

263
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,360
(Ai)

264
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,440
Me again?

265
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,640
Why am I having such bad luck today?

266
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,000
Truth again.

267
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,960
Alright, let's spin the wheel one more time.

268
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,640
(P' Waan)

269
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,000
Go ahead and ask, P' Waan.

270
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,080
I can...

271
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,760
ask anything, right?

272
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,720
Anything at all.

273
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,840
Ask anything you want to know.

274
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,880
Alright, I’d like to ask…

275
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Ai, do have someone you like?

276
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,640
If yes, can you...

277
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,560
tell me the first letter of their name?

278
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Ooh.

279
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,840
Alright, answer.

280
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,080
Juicy.

281
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:41,600
Answer. Answer. Answer. Answer.

282
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,680
If you don’t answer, you have to drink.

283
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,080
Oh.

284
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,280
Alright.

285
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,800
That’s it then.

286
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,600
What’s going on? Everyone’s waiting for your answer.

287
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,680
Shall we start a new round?

288
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Next round, everyone.

289
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
(P'  Yu.)

290
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,680
It's P'  Yu's turn!

291
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,640
True or dare?

292
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,800
Dare.

293
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,080
He's brave!

294
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,600
Come on.

295
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,360
(Ing)

296
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,640
P' Yu.

297
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,560
Calm down, Ing.

298
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,400
I’m sorry.

299
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,360
Come on.

300
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,040
Stare at the person opposite you for one minute.

301
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,320
Up close.

302
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,600
And why me?

303
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,480
Well, you played me last round.

304
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,400
So I’m getting my revenge.

305
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Are you scared?

306
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
Why would I be scared? Of course I’m not.

307
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,800
Let's start.

308
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Yo, start the timer.

309
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,880
One minute, everyone.

310
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,640
One, two, three.

311
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,400
A little closer

312
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,760
Go, Ai, hold your ground.

313
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,280
A bit closer.

314
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,120
Alright.

315
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,960
But it hasn’t even been a minute yet.

316
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Huh, not yet?

317
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,560
Uh, it’s only been forty seconds.

318
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,240
I think that’s enough.

319
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,400
Consider it a tie.

320
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,760
Both are losers.

321
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,920
Both of you drink a full glass.

322
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,600
It’s okay, I’ll drink it for him.

323
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,720
Is that alright, Yo?

324
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,040
Sure.

325
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,480
Do I have to drink mine too?

326
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,240
Well, you're drinking Ai’s and you haven't started yours yet.

327
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,000
Got it.

328
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,800
Keep it up, P'  Yu.

329
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
How about a final toast?

330
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,160
More?

331
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,680
Just a bit.

332
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,560
Just a little, for tradition.

333
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,040
Just a little bit.

334
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,120
Okay.

335
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Let’s clink glasses.

336
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,320
Oh, cheers!

337
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,400
Let’s clink glasses.

338
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
You guys just keep cheering non-stop.

339
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,680
I’ll need to the bathroom first.

340
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,200
Go ahead.

341
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,920
Are you alright?

342
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,280
I'm ok.

343
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,720
Yo, your friend.

344
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,640
He's so drunk that he's not walking straight.

345
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,120
Why did you guys stop drinking?

346
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Come on, cheers.

347
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,080
Hey.

348
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,480
Hey, are you ok?

349
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,800
Get up, come on.

350
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,360
I think I should take Ai to bed.

351
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,800
Do you need my help?

352
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,920
It's ok.

353
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,400
Stay with your friend.

354
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,520
Sure.

355
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,440
You rarely get to hang out like this.

356
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,920
Take care.

357
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,280
That's enough, you still want more?

358
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,880
Let's get you to bed.

359
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,440
Yo.

360
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,040
That's enough.

361
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,600
Are P'  Yu and Ai really that close?

362
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, they grew up together,

363
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,880
so it's only natural they're close.

364
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,520
But what about you? You've been with Ai all day today.

365
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,800
Do you like Ai that much?

366
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,240
I’ve been meaning to ask you this a few times already.

367
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,800
Can you tell me...

368
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,480
why you like Ai so much?

369
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,440
Could you tell me?

370
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,800
Do you remember...

371
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,760
the time I lost during the university tryouts?

372
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,280
This is for you.

373
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,400
For me?

374
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,240
I’ve been cheering you on. You're amazing, keep it up!

375
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,520
Thank you so much.

376
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,520
Yeah.

377
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,960
Why are you smiling like that?

378
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,800
What’s on your mind? Can you tell me?

379
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,160
Oh, it’s nothing.

380
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,440
I just like him.

381
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,640
Okay, let me help you out then.

382
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,720
How could you possibly help me?

383
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,360
I can help you with anything you need.

384
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,720
Where did P' Yu and Ai go?

385
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,080
P' Yu took Ai to bed.

386
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,920
But tonight, you’re sleeping with me.

387
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,520
Let Ai sleep with P' Yu.

388
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,120
Then...

389
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,880
you two go ahead and continue drinking.

390
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,240
I'm going to head home.

391
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,160
Everybody is leaving me.

392
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,720
Hey, wait.

393
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,840
Where are you going?

394
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm going to go to bed.

395
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,200
No.

396
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,240
You have to stay and play with me first.

397
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,040
What do I get from playing with you?

398
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,680
You get to play.

399
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,000
Or you can just give up like the rest of them, I'm fine with that.

400
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Come on.

401
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,480
You wanna have go?

402
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,240
Just don't throw up.

403
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,840
I’m a gold standard drinker, you know!

404
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,120
Whoever finishes first wins!

405
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,000
Alright, let's go!

406
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,920
Yes! I won!

407
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,360
Do you want to head back and sleep first?

408
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,080
You alright, Yo?

409
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,000
I told you to drink less.

410
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,840
I’ll go get you a change of clothes, hang tight.

411
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,640
Hey, Ing, come here for a sec.

412
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,560
You know what?

413
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,520
You’re the best friend I’ve ever had in this world.

414
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,880
We’re such good friends, huh?

415
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,040
Do friends...

416
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,400
usually do like this?

417
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,240
Well,

418
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,920
we’re friends, right?

419
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,360
But... don't you love me the way...

420
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,040
I love you?

421
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,440
I love you,

422
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,760
but not as a friend.

423
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,200
I know.

424
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,320
I love you just like...

425
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,800
Yo...

426
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,760
Are you okay?

427
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,720
Argh, Yo.

428
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,200
Just a sec, we're almost there.

429
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,960
Ai, come on.

430
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,200
Ooh, P' Yu.

431
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,960
Wait for me.

432
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,680
Quickly.

433
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,200
Wait for me.

434
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,640
Shit!!

435
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,360
P' Yu!

436
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,920
P' Yu, what are you doing here?

437
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,440
Where's Ing?

438
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,160
I think he's sleeping in Yo's room.

439
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,240
Don't tell me you don’t remember anything.

440
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,200
Remember what?

441
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,560
Everything?

442
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,760
Why?

443
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,840
What did I do?
