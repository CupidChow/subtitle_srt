(This series is purely a work of fiction,)

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,000
(and is not related to any actual persons,
places, organizations, or events.)

3
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,120
Is something wrong with you?

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,640
I've noticed for a while now.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,000
I just feel strange.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Well, as we grow up,

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,000
It feels like we are forced to follow our dreams.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,800
Are you done?

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,520
Let's go home.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,240
Wait a minute, the atmosphere here is nice.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,280
P' Yu!!

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,520
I'm sorry, Ai.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,640
I won't tease you anymore.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,280
Because I don't want to be someone you dislike.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,080
This is a birthday present from me.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,640
I hope you're happy.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,200
I'm going to go now,

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,480
I hope you have good dreams.

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,520
Argh!!

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,560
Ai, what's wrong?

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,080
Mom!

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,000
What's wrong?

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,640
What are these noises in the morning?

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,040
I was cleaning the restroom and got scared.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,120
Ah...

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,280
I had a nightmare.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Mom! It was really a nightmare.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Mom! Get out!

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,840
I am literally 20.

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,240
You cannot just walk in.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,600
But still, you had a nightmare and screamed so loud.

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,360
So grown up.

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,000
And just hurry in getting up

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,560
or you would be late for class again.

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,840
Take the food for P' Yu too.

36
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,720
No!

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,640
You give it to him yourself.

38
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,440
Eh, you are about to go out, aren't you?

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Just take it to him.

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,200
Hurry up.
Mom!

41
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,840
Ai!!

42
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,200
What happened?

43
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,400
Yu.

44
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
Hello.

45
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
Hi! Now, this is perfect.

46
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,520
I was asking Ai to bring this food to his dad.

47
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,280
He forgot it.

48
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,920
Um.

49
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,280
Can you take him there?

50
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Mom, I'd be late for class.

51
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,240
For sure.

52
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,760
Thank you Yu.

53
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,040
See? Yu is such an good boy.

54
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,480
Ai, Just a quick ride,

55
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
and P' Yu can drop you off too.

56
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,400
Just wait here,

57
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,480
he will come soon.

58
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,000
What's wrong?

59
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
Oh, Ai, Yu.

60
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,120
Hi!
Hi, hi.

61
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Thank you for bringing me lunch.

62
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,240
You're welcome.

63
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,600
Dad, thank me!

64
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,560
I'm the one who brought it here.

65
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,880
What? Yu was the one driving.

66
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,400
You just sat still, no tiring task.

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,480
Why would you say that?

68
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,880
I thank both of you, Brought it all the way here.

69
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,840
Got it. Now, time to go to class and to work.

70
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,800
Right?
Yes.

71
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
And don't come home so late.

72
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,360
There are lots of robbers around.

73
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,160
I know I know.

74
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,320
I'm going now.

75
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,280
What's the matter with him?

76
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,120
I have no idea.

77
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,440
What happened?

78
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
No, nothing.

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,960
You said you are no longer mad that I pranked you.

80
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,200
Yes.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,320
This is... just normal for me.

82
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,720
Normal?

83
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,400
And you can look at me now?

84
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,480
Yes... of course.

85
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,640
Why can't I?

86
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,680
P' Yu, drive.

87
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,720
Yes, sir.

88
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,680
Ah... and this evening do you have any plans?

89
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,120
I was thinking...

90
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,000
I will sleep over at Ing's room.

91
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,760
We have homework.

92
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,440
Please, let me sleepover at yours.

93
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,360
You have your own home.

94
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
Why don't you just sleep at yours?

95
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,560
Ai

96
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,360
Ai?

97
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,960
(Do you all understand?)

98
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,880
(Any questions?)

99
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,000
Ai!

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,600
No!

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,720
Ah... Okay, if it was so unclear,

102
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,560
I can explain it again.

103
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,000
Uh... No, professor.

104
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,240
No question.

105
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,240
Sorry.

106
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay.

107
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,760
What is wrong with you?

108
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,760
It's because....you won't let me sleepover.

109
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,240
Do you need to overreact that much?

110
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Okay, you can.

111
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,240
Thank you, bestie.

112
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,640
(And, that's it for today)

113
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,880
(Goodbye, everyone)

114
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,000
Yo.

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,880
Yo.

116
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,920
Yo!

117
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,000
What's wrong?

118
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,800
No, nothing's wrong.

119
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
I am totally fine.

120
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,920
Yes, absolutely totally fine.

121
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,120
See? Everyone is out already.

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,480
It's the girlfriend for sure.

123
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,040
What girlfriend? We were just talking.

124
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,240
See?

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,240
Uh...after today's class...

126
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,040
do you guys want to go to the volunteer club room?

127
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,120
This evening, I cannot.

128
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,440
I have a badminton club.

129
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,920
If not because of the scholarship,

130
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,400
I would not have to care about all these clubs.

131
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,520
Ing is also a scholarship kid.

132
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,880
He doesn't have problems like you.

133
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,760
Alright, Don't forget tomorrow,

134
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,640
we have a photoshoot for the volunteer camp.

135
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,760
Wait, wait.

136
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,880
Hello?

137
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,320
Yes, I just finished class right now.

138
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
I'm going, bye.

139
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,760
See you.

140
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,760
Ohho.

141
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,320
What about you? Are you going?

142
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,680
Of course.

143
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,480
But, can I go to the library first?

144
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,000
I want to look for some information.

145
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,560
You? Going to the library?

146
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,080
Just tell me what is this about.

147
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
You have been acting weird since before the class.

148
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,840
What? No!

149
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
I'm just looking for something.

150
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
What thing?

151
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,280
Uh...I have an idea for a film.

152
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,240
Huh!

153
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,400
You? Want to make a film?

154
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,400
Have you decided to major in film?

155
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,280
Not sure yet.

156
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,480
Just an idea.

157
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,560
So, I am doing research.

158
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,840
Ah... and what is this idea you are talking about?

159
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,200
So I can help you.

160
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,960
It's...

161
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Do you think it is possible that...

162
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,160
we dream about something, some event,

163
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,480
It happened in real life.

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,680
I don't know.

165
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,800
Can it really happen?

166
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,480
And, why do you care about it?

167
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,400
I...

168
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,680
I...just...

169
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,720
Okay, okay.

170
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
I'll just help research.

171
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,320
Interesting.

172
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,760
Can be a film's premise.

173
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,640
Premise...

174
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,040
Do you get it?

175
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,960
Yes.

176
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,320
A film's premise right?

177
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,560
Interesting.

178
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
A dream is formed by the unconscious mind...

179
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
and also a storage for desires.

180
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,960
Especially, sexual desires.

181
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,640
What is going on, Ai?

182
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,000
Too loud! keep it down!

183
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Sorry, sorry.

184
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,800
I'll help.

185
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,440
Darn!

186
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
What are you doing?

187
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
In the dark too?

188
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,560
I was horrified.

189
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,480
What's wrong with you weirdo?

190
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,280
What?

191
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,720
Nothing.

192
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,680
Just go shower, you smell.

193
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,920
Wanna smell me?

194
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Smell it, fresh sweat.

195
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,640
Ew, go shower now.

196
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,040
Sure?

197
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,200
Um.

198
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,400
Go.

199
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,360
(Due to the report, citizens claim to have seen a man doing drugs in the area)

200
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,280
(A citizen told a journalist that)

201
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,200
(A person broke into his house and stole things)

202
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,000
(sometimes, he would steal from people walking by)

203
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,360
This is just around your home, Ai.

204
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,120
(Initially, we have coordinated with the officers)

205
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,960
(And they have taken over)

206
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,080
Ai!

207
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,280
Ai!

208
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,120
Ai!!

209
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
What? I almost jumped!

210
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,280
I was focusing.

211
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,800
Focusing on what?

212
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,240
Let me see.

213
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,600
Just a little.

214
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,160
No.

215
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,320
Are you still researching for information?

216
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,600
Aren't you too serious?

217
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
I don't think it's just about a film anymore.

218
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,120
Tell me. What is this about?

219
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,600
Do you remember Christmas Day?

220
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,800
Yeah, why?

221
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,480
The night before that,

222
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,320
I dreamed about the exact same thing.

223
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,880
Of me at the Christmas tree.

224
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,000
Are you saying...

225
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
that you dreamt about yourself falling off the Christmas tree?

226
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,640
Did it happen?

227
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,720
So?

228
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,720
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

229
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,680
And it happened again!

230
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,280
(Ow!)

231
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,360
(Ow!)

232
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,080
(Ai!!)

233
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,840
(P' Yu.)

234
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,640
You are just overthinking.

235
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,080
Coincidence can't happen this many times.

236
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,240
You need more sleep.

237
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
I'm not talking to you anymore.

238
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,880
You don't have to believe me.

239
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,640
Just wait and see.

240
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What? Are you mad at me now?

241
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,480
Hey!
Hey!

242
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,040
I was shocked.

243
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,360
What's wrong with you?

244
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,520
I dreamed again.

245
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,920
You will see. It's going to happen today.

246
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
A bottle of water, please.

247
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,280
Um.

248
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,280
Ai.

249
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
You are too obsessed with this.

250
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Shh...Haven't you heard that saying?

251
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,880
If you don't believe it,

252
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,960
don't disrespect it.

253
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,480
He's definitely coming.

254
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,560
A bottle of water, please.

255
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,440
Hey!

256
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,880
(I told you.)

257
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,640
Hi there.

258
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,720
Yo.

259
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,080
Why is P' Yu here?

260
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,000
What? I asked him to help with the photos.

261
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,680
Why didn't you tell me?

262
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,800
I did.

263
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,760
You did not.

264
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,800
I did.

265
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,480
I think?

266
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
So, P' Yu is here

267
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,200
Why are you complaining?

268
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,120
Because...

269
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,120
I don't know.

270
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,240
Darn it.

271
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,840
Take him out.

272
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,240
Quiet Yo, quiet.

273
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,960
It's hot in here, isn't it?

274
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
Can I have one cold cup of water, please?

275
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
P' Yu, the set is ready.

276
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,960
Oh, sure.

277
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,920
Give it to me.

278
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,280
Give me it.

279
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,600
Say it nicely.
A little.

280
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,880
What are you doing, Ing?

281
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,440
Give me it.

282
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,000
Give.

283
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,480
You are such a bad boy, huh?

284
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,000
Ing.

285
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
You need to be punished

286
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,400
Yo.

287
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,160
Naughty boy, huh?

288
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,640
What did you do?

289
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,440
No, Yo!

290
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,480
Yo! No, no!

291
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,680
This...

292
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,720
Ah...

293
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,840
I'm going to work now.

294
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,080
What's the matter?

295
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,200
No.

296
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,720
Umm.

297
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Did you just run from P' Yu?

298
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,720
No.

299
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,280
And who is at the food desk now?

300
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,000
You.

301
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Me? Are you nuts?

302
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,840
I am literally here.

303
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Ah.. right.

304
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,480
What's up with you?

305
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,800
Sleep too little?

306
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,240
Just hurry up.

307
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,040
Um.

308
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
One, two, three.

309
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,360
Aw, so cute.

310
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,560
Ai!

311
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,360
Your turn now.

312
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,440
Um.

313
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,080
Ready?

314
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,120
You can relax.

315
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
One, two, three.

316
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,080
Here, Too stiff.

317
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,680
Umm, wait.

318
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,480
Just relax, okay?

319
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,560
How does he look?

320
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,520
Looking good.

321
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,160
Right?
Yes.

322
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,280
Again.

323
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
My friend surely is the most handsome.

324
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,800
Right?

325
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,800
I'll do it.

326
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,760
Alright.

327
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,280
Okay.

328
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,720
Here you go.

329
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,800
Just switch.

330
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,640
Okay.

331
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,040
Thank you.
Thank you.

332
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,720
Let's do it.

333
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,800
We'll go again, okay?

334
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,880
Come on.

335
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
One, two, three.

336
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,720
Relax a bit more.

337
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,160
Smile too.

338
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
One, two, three.

339
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,920
Calm down. One more time.

340
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,280
All your friends are here.

341
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,760
One more time.

342
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,480
P' Yu, stop!

343
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,760
Oh no!
Gosh!

344
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,080
What happened?

345
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,160
The statue is broken.

346
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
It's broken.

347
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,360
Is he okay?
