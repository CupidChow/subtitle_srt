00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,480
This series is purely a work of fiction

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,000
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,600
It's necessary, bro.

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,320
They might be waiting for you to say something.

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,960
And if I do end up dating P' Yu,

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,720
will you be okay with that?

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,120
Of course, I’d be fine with it.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,200
You’re my friend,

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,160
and P' Yu is my brother.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
What should I do?

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,880
Do.. what?

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,880
To make it clear.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Let me be the one to take care of you from now on.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,760
Be my boyfriend, Ing.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,040
Be my boyfriend?

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:58,960
Yeah.

17
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,560
P' Yu.

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,880
P' Yu.

19
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,360
Don't be scared, I'm here with you.

20
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,440
Tonight, I'll stay with you all night.

21
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,080
How did you get here?

22
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Yo invited me.

23
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,240
Are you and Yo on good terms now?

24
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,720
But what about you? How did you get here together?

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,680
Well, we've been sleeping together anyway, right?

26
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,320
Well...

27
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,200
Hey, stop arguing and come eat.

28
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,200
Okay.

29
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,480
I was thinking of ordering pizza,

30
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,920
but I didn't expect Father Mhok and Mother Aoi was going to be here.

31
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,280
At the vineyard, there was a disease affecting the grapes.

32
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,560
It was hectic.

33
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,720
On the way back, there was a lot of traffic, so we just got here.

34
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,880
Um, Ing, why don't you stay over tonight?

35
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,800
By the time we finish eating, it'll be late.

36
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Uh...

37
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,920
Sure, Dad, but I'll sleep in Yo's room.

38
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,200
Payback for how often he crashes at my dorm.

39
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,560
Ai.

40
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,120
We've been away for a few days.

41
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,360
Have you been giving P' Yu any trouble?

42
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,160
Not at all, what kind of person do you think I am?

43
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,480
Are you sure?

44
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,120
Yes.

45
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,640
Ai's been much more cute lately.

46
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,000
Try this.

47
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
How can he not be cute,

48
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,000
nowadays he's...

49
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,360
Please excuse me, I have homework to do.

50
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,920
What homework?

51
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,000
The one our professor gave us.

52
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,600
The really difficult one that I haven't finished.

53
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,040
Yeah.

54
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,080
Come on, P' Yu.

55
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,840
Aren't you going to have another?

56
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,400
No, come teach me.

57
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,920
I can’t do it, it’s too hard.

58
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,400
Come on.

59
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,640
Aren’t you going to eat first?

60
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,400
I’ll eat later,

61
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,040
please save some food for me.

62
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,960
Alright, come on.

63
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,800
What?
Come here, P’ Yu.

64
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,480
Why?

65
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,600
What were you doing earlier?

66
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,560
I just complimented you, saying you were cute.

67
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,240
Why?

68
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,760
Did you not like it?

69
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,800
When have you ever called me cute in front of my parents?

70
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
And look at Yo, too.

71
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,360
They’ll figure it out soon enough.

72
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,600
I’m sorry,

73
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,760
I wasn’t thinking.

74
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,760
But someday, they will have to know, right?

75
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,480
Yes, but now’s not the time.

76
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,000
I’m just worried about how they’ll feel.

77
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,120
You understand, right, P’ Yu?

78
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,800
I understand.

79
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,200
What are we going to do now?

80
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,040
Do we have to keep talking like this in secret forever?

81
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,280
I don’t know.

82
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,960
P’ Yu, I need some time to adjust.

83
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,800
It’s okay,

84
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
I understand.

85
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,000
Who are you? Let go of my friend right now!

86
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,520
I’m your boyfriend, speak nicely.

87
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,320
Say it, quickly.

88
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,840
Say it, quickly.

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,760
Are you going to say it or not?

90
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,640
Okay, okay,

91
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,840
I’ll say it.

92
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
What’s wrong?

93
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,200
Hey,

94
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,000
I’m not ready yet.

95
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,440
Then, I’m going to the bathroom first.

96
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,800
It’s cold today, isn’t it?

97
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,880
What do you think?

98
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,960
Yeah,

99
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,280
it’s so cold it chills me to the bone.

100
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,640
And what about this?

101
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,560
Does it help?

102
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,000
Ai!

103
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,920
Mom!!

104
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,720
You ungrateful child!

105
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,760
Mom!

106
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,280
Ai!

107
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,360
You ungrateful child!

108
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,120
Mom!

109
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,120
P’ Yu.

110
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Can I go to the bathroom for a moment?

111
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,640
Just wait here for a bit.

112
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,560
P’ Yu, come here quickly.

113
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,160
Ohho!

114
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,840
There are only weird pictures here.

115
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,400
This one is pretty, though.

116
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,640
Yeah, it’s cute.

117
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,280
Why? Do you like this picture?

118
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
I think there’s something about this picture.

119
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,880
Like what?

120
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,440
I feel like this picture is just like me.

121
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,560
What do you think, P’ Yu?

122
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
I’m not sure.

123
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
This picture is both...

124
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,360
beautiful and scary.

125
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,240
And it’s sad too.

126
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,000
Wow,

127
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,040
that’s pretty deep.

128
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,880
I wish you would look at me the way you look at this picture.

129
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,120
What are you saying?

130
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,400
Take a look first.

131
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,280
P’ Yu.

132
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,800
Let’s keep looking around.

133
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,760
Hey, wait a second.

134
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,760
Alright, let’s go then.

135
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,400
The cake is ready!

136
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,560
Thank you.

137
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,160
You don’t have to stare at me like that.

138
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,640
You’re the one who told me to look!

139
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,480
But it doesn’t have to be that intense, does it?

140
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,400
Huh?

141
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,480
So why did you bring me here?

142
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
I just wanted to hang out with you, just the two of us.

143
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,480
And I’m planning to hold a photo exhibition too.

144
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,720
Really, P’ Yu?

145
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,560
Yeah.

146
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,200
But there are still a lot of things to do,

147
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,640
and it might take some time.

148
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
So, what’s the concept?

149
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,400
The concept?

150
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,320
That’s a secret.

151
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,320
Oh come on,

152
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,280
not even your boyfriend can know?

153
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,640
Don’t try that on me.

154
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,600
You’ll just have to wait and see.

155
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,600
Please, P’ Yu?

156
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,920
Please.

157
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,040
P’ Yu...

158
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,680
Nope.

159
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,280
Just a little hint won’t hurt.

160
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,080
P’ Yu...

161
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,400
P’ Yu, look at me.

162
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,360
Please?

163
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,560
Please?

164
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,920
Oh, here it is, P’ Yu. This is the place.

165
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,880
Park right here.

166
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,640
Alright.

167
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,840
Take care of yourself, okay?

168
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
And don’t go charming anyone, got it?

169
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
What kind of person do you think I am?

170
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,680
You're my cutie pie.

171
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,240
Saying it out loud, aren't you embarrassed?

172
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,000
Why would I be? It’s all true.

173
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,760
Alright, I'm leaving now.

174
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,480
Ai.

175
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,000
What?

176
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Don’t get drunk, okay?

177
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,520
Yeah.

178
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,200
Take care of yourself.

179
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,360
Cheers!

180
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,840
You’ve never dragged me to a bar before.

181
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,520
What's wrong?

182
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,320
I’m stressed.

183
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,360
Stressed about what?

184
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,840
Well...

185
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,200
Are you going to tell me or not?

186
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,400
Well...

187
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,840
I want to sleep with Yo.

188
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,600
But you two are friends!

189
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,160
Friends, my ass.

190
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,560
We’re together now.

191
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,520
So why didn’t you tell me?

192
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,640
Well...

193
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,800
P’ Yu and I are together too, by the way.

194
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,920
Are you telling me or bragging?

195
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,680
I’m telling you.

196
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,960
And maybe bragging a little.

197
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,240
So,

198
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,480
what’s your story?

199
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,320
Last night, he asked me to be his boyfriend

200
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
And the atmosphere just...

201
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Uh, never mind.

202
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,600
I want to have sex with Yo.

203
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,480
Uh, I get it.

204
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,360
I want to, too.

205
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,400
What?

206
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,400
Do you want to have sex with Yo too?

207
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,080
Ugh, gross.

208
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,280
I meant P’ Yu.

209
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
Then why are you stressing about it?

210
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,160
Just tell Yo.

211
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,360
Or are you too scared?

212
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,280
The problem isn’t with me,

213
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,840
it’s with Yo.

214
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,560
Why?

215
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,200
He refuses to sleep with me.

216
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
What? Someone like Yo?

217
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,200
Refuses to sleep with you?

218
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,280
Maybe he’s disgusted by me.

219
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,440
Are you crazy?

220
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,320
If he was disgusted, would he have asked you to be his boyfriend?

221
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,960
Then why won’t he sleep with me?

222
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,040
Just ask him.

223
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,800
I don’t know.

224
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,600
Ai!

225
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,640
Hmm?

226
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,280
Can you dream for me?

227
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,520
See when Yo and I will finally sleep together.

228
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
You want me to dream about you two sleeping together?

229
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,920
Sorry,

230
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,080
keep it down.

231
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,200
It’s you!

232
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,520
Come on, Ai, dream for me, please?

233
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,680
Ing, I think you’re drunk.

234
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,720
Stop it.

235
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,800
I’m going to the toilet.

236
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,560
Please dream for me?

237
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,600
Please.

238
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,840
I dreamt that you fell off the table.

239
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,360
Really?

240
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Yeah, I was the one who kicked you off.

241
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,640
I’m out.

242
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,080
Ai.

243
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,680
P'Wann!

244
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,920
Are you here alone?

245
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,360
I came with Ing.

246
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,240
Oh.

247
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,400
What about you, P’Wann?

248
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,640
I’m here with friends.

249
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,760
How are you?

250
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
I’m good.

251
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,000
And you,

252
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,160
And you, P'Wann? How are you?

253
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,000
I mean, about that thing...

254
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,320
I'm fine now.

255
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Don't worry about it.

256
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,680
Please excuse me, I have to go to the toilet.

257
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,200
Please go ahead, sorry.

258
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Then, see you later.

259
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,440
Whoever finishes first wins.

260
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,480
I win.

261
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,800
So, what’s the deal with P’Yu?

262
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,040
You said your situation is like mine.

263
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,160
So that means...

264
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,280
Uh,

265
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,600
no, not yet.

266
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,200
You just have to know, don’t you?

267
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
I do.

268
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,440
Why is it a problem, though?

269
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,120
I just feel guilty for some reason.

270
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
I don’t even know how to start. I don’t even know how to start.

271
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
If you don’t know,

272
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,200
just let P’ Yu start it.

273
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,960
But I’m not sure how far P’Yu wants to take it.

274
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,720
Hey, calm down, take it easy.

275
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,840
So, you need to see how he acts first.

276
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,000
But what’s this guilt about?

277
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,680
I don’t get it.

278
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
I feel guilty toward my parents.

279
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
They love P’ Yu like their own son.

280
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,440
I’m scared of disappointing them.

281
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,400
Don’t overthink it.

282
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,120
If they love P’Yu like their own,

283
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,880
they might accept you two being together.

284
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,520
Yeah, you’re right.

285
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,840
You’re pretty smart, you know that?

286
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,920
For being this smart,

287
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,800
you’re definitely getting it tonight.

288
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,320
Huh?

289
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,040
Are you okay?

290
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,400
P' Wann!

291
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,760
How did you let your friend get this drunk?

292
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,720
It's just a little bit.

293
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,280
P' Wann,

294
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
I'm sorry.

295
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,000
I don't want to make you sad.

296
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,640
It's fine.

297
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,120
I'm ok.

298
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,560
That's not true.

299
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,680
Your eyes say something else.

300
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,840
The car will crash.

301
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,440
You're kind of cute when you're drunk.

303
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,880
Ai, you're talking too much.

304
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,000
P' Wann.

305
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,600
I know.

306
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,000
Tonight Yo is going to get it.

307
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,720
Hey.

308
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,400
Yeah, that's it! You can do it.

309
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,000
See you.

310
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,480
Good night.

311
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,280
Ing?

312
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,920
P' Yu?

313
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,000
Please take care of Ai for me, P’Yu.

314
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,280
He’s over there.

315
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,680
Alright, I got it.

316
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,640
But as for Yo, I’ll handle him myself.

317
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,280
Ouch, ouch!

318
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,720
You okay?

319
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,880
I’m fine, don’t worry.

320
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,680
Can you walk into the house?

321
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,640
Come on, I’ll help you.

322
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,520
I’m fine.

323
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,320
Hello, P’Yu.

324
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,080
Hello.

325
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,720
I happened to run into Ai and Ing at the bar.

326
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,440
They were both so drunk, so I offered to bring them home.

327
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,920
Thank you so much.

328
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,360
No problem.

329
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,160
Come here.

330
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,000
P’ Yu!

331
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,840
Enough already, why did you let yourself get this drunk?

332
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,600
I’m not drunk.

333
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,080
Enough, get in the house.

334
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,480
Go.

335
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,640
Get in the house, quickly.

336
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,240
Yo.

337
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,520
Yo.

338
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,000
What’s up?

339
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,560
What's wrong?

340
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,520
Yo.

341
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,680
Are you drunk?

342
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,000
What did you do? Why are you so drunk?

343
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,760
Don't talk.

344
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,520
Drink some water.

345
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,840
Don't speak.

346
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,400
Ing.

347
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,360
Ing!!
