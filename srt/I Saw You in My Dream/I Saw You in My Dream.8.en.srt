00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,400
This series is purely a work of fiction

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,160
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,000
Surprise!

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,640
Ai, could you wipe P'Wann's face?

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
Did you know why P' Wann was the hunter instead of Yo?

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,400
I don’t like it.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,960
P' Wann, You don't need to go anywhere, just sleep here.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,040
What exactly are you trying to do?

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,880
I just saw you two getting along pretty well.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,200
Then, you know this, I don’t like it.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,520
I’m frustrated!

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,080
I don't want to be unsure anymore.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,440
I like you.

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,440
I don't want to be unsure anymore.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,240
I...

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,760
don't want to lose you.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
I like you.

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,840
Hello, Mr. Caterer.

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,480
Could I have a glass of cold water?

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,520
Ah, sure.

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,480
I'm just kidding,

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,880
I'll share it with Ai.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,640
Can I?

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,680
Here.

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,960
Thanks.

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
P' Yu, what are you doing?

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,400
Don't tell me...

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,680
you forgot all about last night.

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,880
Yeah,

30
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,640
who would remember?

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,400
Really?

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,280
But...

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,320
P’ Yu, you can’t just touch me like that without asking for permission.

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,200
Otherwise, I'll charge you.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,640
How much would it be...

36
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,880
if you did?

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,920
And if I paid,

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,080
could I touch everything?

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,120
Stop it, P’ Yu.

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,120
Go get to work,

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,760
go on.

42
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,880
I’m not going.

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,360
Go.

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,120
No.

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,760
Go.

46
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,000
I said no.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,360
Wanna go together?
No.

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,560
I’m just going to sit here and chill.

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,280
Oh, P’ Yu.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,560
The chairman asked if you could go take some pictures.

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,400
Sure.

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,480
Everyone,

53
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,200
Do you want it?

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,960
No thanks, you go ahead.

55
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,040
Please come over here for a picture.

56
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,920
Come on, come over here.

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,640
Have a seat.

58
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,800
Come on.

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,960
Sit right here, sit right here.

60
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,600
Where should you sit? Where should you sit?

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,760
Move in closer together.

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,040
P' Yu, come a take it with us.

63
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,280
Sure, let me set the timer.

64
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,920
Leave some space.

65
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,760
Good.

66
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,920
That's great.

67
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Ready? I'm going to take a picture now.

68
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,040
Come on, quickly.

69
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,440
Ready?

70
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,120
I'm going to count to three and we all go hey~

71
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,760
Ok, ready?

72
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,640
One. Two. Three.

73
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,440
Hey!!

74
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,560
One, two, three!

75
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,920
Ok.

76
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,560
The car is going to be here in fifteen minutes.

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,360
Tell everyone to pack up and then meet back here.

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,480
Then we’ll head back to Bangkok.

79
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,880
Okay.

80
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,640
Finally going home.

81
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,200
Ai.

82
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Yes, P’ Wann?

83
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,880
Can I talk to you for a bit?

84
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,840
I don’t know where to start.

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,960
I just wanted to apologize to you.

86
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,600
Apologize to me…

87
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,560
Why are you apologizing?

88
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,320
It’s just…

89
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,160
I’m sorry for making you uncomfortable.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I’m frustrated!

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,480
I hate being paired up with someone I don’t like.

92
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,760
I just wanted to...

93
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,560
try my best and see it through,

94
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,720
even if things didn’t turn out as I hoped in the end.

95
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,080
I'm...

96
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,720
I’m sorry.

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,080
Why are you apologizing?

98
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,880
You didn’t do anything wrong.

99
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,760
Are you okay, Ai?

100
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,520
I’m fine.

101
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,600
Hey, Ing.

102
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,000
Come sit here.

103
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,680
Oh, Yo, are we heading back now?

104
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,760
If we are, we can go together.

105
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,280
Let’s go, but just wait a bit first.

106
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,400
Ok.

107
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,040
Let me help.

108
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,320
It's ok.

109
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,680
(P' Yu: Are you asleep?)

110
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,200
(P' Yu: I know you're still awake.)

111
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Hello.

112
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,400
You're smiling and laughing.

113
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,920
I want to make you...

114
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,800
happy every day.

115
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,320
This is so good.

116
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,400
What is?

117
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,520
I never thought...

118
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,800
this window...

119
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
would bring me so much happiness.

120
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,960
It’s the same view,

121
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,120
the same window,

122
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,480
but the feeling is different.

123
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,000
Wow,

124
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,640
I never knew you had this side.

125
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,080
There are still many sides of me you haven’t seen yet.

126
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,160
But from now on,

127
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,080
I’ll let you see every single part of me.

128
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,480
Who wants to see that?

129
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,880
I’m going to shower and sleep now.

130
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Alright, goodnight.

131
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,120
Goodnight, P' Yu.

132
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Go on then, what are you waiting for?

133
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,080
I’m not the one who wants to go.

134
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,320
If you want to go, then go ahead first.

135
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,840
Go ahead, P' Yu.

136
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,480
No.

137
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,920
Fine, let's end the call together then.

138
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,280
No.

139
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,880
What do you want, P' Yu?

140
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,400
Or do you want to shower with me?

141
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,720
Wait, really?

142
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,440
Just kidding!

143
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,600
Wow, you’re fast with that!

144
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,560
I’m going.

145
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,680
Goodnight.

146
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Goodnight.

147
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,480
Shit!!

148
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
What are you doing all alone in the dark?

149
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
You scared me.

150
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,800
I don't know.

151
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,040
Are you in a bad mood?

152
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,360
I don't know.

153
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,640
Damn.

154
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,920
Is it your fight with Ai?

155
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,040
Yeah.

156
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,640
But you're in a really good mood.

157
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
What made you so happy?

158
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,080
Nothing.

159
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,840
I don't believe you.

160
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
What?

161
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,120
That's good.

162
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Even though I don't ask you a lot...

163
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,160
but I always want you to be happy.

164
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
I also want to see you happy.

165
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,000
You can tell me anything.

166
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,680
You know that?

167
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,680
P' Yu.

168
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,320
What are you doing?

169
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
Wake up.

170
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,160
Let's go eat.

171
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,720
You're not getting up?

172
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,880
Get up.

173
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,480
That's enough.

174
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,200
Enough.

175
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,800
Yo.

176
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,280
You guys...

177
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,160
Huh?!

178
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,680
Ow.

179
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,280
P' Yu said he loves you?

180
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,760
Yeah.

181
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
How did this happen?

182
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,920
What about P' Wann?

183
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,520
I already cleared things up with him.

184
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,640
As for P' Yu...

185
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I'm still not sure what I should do.

186
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
How can you be unsure?

187
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,080
When you have feelings for someone

188
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,360
you have to be upfront about it.

189
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,000
Try your best, but if in the end, it’s not right,

190
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,720
you just step back, that’s it.

191
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,720
But P' Yu hasn’t said anything

192
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,320
clear about our relationship yet.

193
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,640
He only said he’s going to pursue me, that’s all.

194
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,800
You’ve come this far, why hesitate?

195
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,000
Go for it.

196
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,520
Hmm.

197
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,320
Do Yo know about this yet?

198
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,280
You haven’t talked to him, have you?

199
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,360
Yeah.

200
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,560
You should tell him, or he’ll get mad again.

201
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,480
Oh, let him be mad.

202
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,800
Does he think he’s the only one who can get angry?

203
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,040
You two, honestly...

204
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
Well, don’t just talk about me.

205
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,760
What about you and Yo?

206
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,560
How’s it going?

207
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,760
It’s nothing.

208
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,120
I tried,

209
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,440
it didn’t work,

210
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,280
so I stepped back.

211
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,120
Cute, cute!

212
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,160
Big smiles, happy energy!
Boost that energy a bit.

213
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,720
Boost that energy a bit.

214
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,320
Great job!

215
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,400
One, two.

216
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,120
Just a little more, one, two!

217
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,480
One last one.

218
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,400
Ok, just a sec.

219
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,800
Is it ok?

220
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,040
It's ok, it's fine.
It's good, right?

221
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,520
Ok, Pim, you're all done.

222
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,360
You can go home now, you did great.

223
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,280
You can come in now.

224
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,000
Ai.

225
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,200
What are you doing?

226
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,840
Why are you sitting alone?

227
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,440
I don't have the energy to fight with you today.

228
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,520
Are you in a bad mood?

229
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
You can't see it?

230
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,280
What's wrong?

231
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,600
This is so good.

232
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,840
Do you like it?

233
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,480
If you like it, I’ll come swing you every day.

234
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,680
Can we just take the swing and put it at home instead?

235
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,160
Sure, I’ll bring it over for you.

236
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,320
You promise?

237
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,840
Promise.

238
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,200
P’ Yu.

239
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,240
Hey, P’ Yu!

240
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,640
Is he okay now?

241
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,400
Yeah, okay.

242
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,720
Alright, then I’m going to let him go now.

243
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,960
Sure, sure.

244
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,680
Okay, all done. Let's go.

245
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,600
Thank you!

246
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:56,840
Let’s go quickly.

247
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,360
Great job!

248
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Let’s wrap up, pack up, and head home!

249
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,200
Thank you so much.

250
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,520
What?

251
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You’ve been smiling while filming!

252
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,520
You look happy these days.

253
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,920
Is something going on?

254
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,840
You must have a lovers, don’t you?

255
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,760
Or wait,

256
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,360
have you not asked them out yet?

257
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
No doubt about it!

258
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,360
Do I really need to ask them to be my partner?

259
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
You should make it clear.

260
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,160
They might be waiting for you to say something.

261
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,640
Really?

262
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,720
Yes, for sure.

263
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
(Yo.)

264
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Hey, what are you doing?

265
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Keep it down, this is the library!

266
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,800
If you want to sleep, just sleep, I'm going to read.

267
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,960
You read your book.

268
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,240
I’m going to nap, I’m annoyed.

269
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,520
Don’t you have a class?

270
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,680
Aren’t you going to go?

271
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,080
How do you even know the class schedule for advertising majors?

272
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
I have friends, you know.

273
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,160
Oh.

274
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,920
It's about the fight with Ai, right?

275
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Still haven’t talked yet?

276
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,920
Then why are you even asking if you already know?

277
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,480
You didn’t pick up my call earlier either.

278
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,160
Then why ask if you know?

279
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,000
Go wherever you want to go.

280
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,440
I don’t want to.

281
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,480
Fine, then I’ll go.

282
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,880
Ouch, don’t go yet.

283
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,200
Don't go.

284
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,760
Then go talk to Ai.

285
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
I know you meant well with what you did for Ai,

286
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
but this is something he has to handle on his own.

287
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,600
He needs to learn for himself.

288
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,600
You don't even like me.

289
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
So you can't just force someone to like him.

290
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,080
Hello, P' Yu.

291
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Can I borrow your fixed lens?

292
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,280
Sure, you can go and get it.

293
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,040
Ok.

294
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,640
Are you here to steal?
