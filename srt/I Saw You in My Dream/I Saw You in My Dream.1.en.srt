1
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Someone once said,

2
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,960
when we sleep,

3
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,960
we are like a box being opened.

4
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,120
Because something in our subconscious

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,800
is expressed as images,

6
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,240
or what we all call dreams.

7
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
Wake up!

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,440
P' Yu, what are you doing?

9
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,080
Wake up!

10
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,440
Everyone else is ready.

11
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,080
We're all waiting for you.

12
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,560
We’re going to be late for church.

13
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,800
Darn it!!!

14
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,080
This is P' Yu,

15
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,120
The boy next door who has been teasing me since I was a kid.

16
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Ow.

17
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,520
P' Yu, turn it off!

18
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,000
Why?

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,680
Are you going to turn it off or not?

20
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,520
No.
Turn it off.

21
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,000
Or else I'm going to shoot.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,200
Come on, shoot me.

23
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,840
We're never going to be on good terms.

24
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,200
(You don't love me anymore?)

25
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,120
P' Yu, I told you that I'm not watching it, I'm scared.

26
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,600
(You don't love me anymore?)

27
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,200
P' Yu

28
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,120
(You don't love me anymore?)

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,920
(You don't love me anymore?)

30
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,040
(You don't love...)

31
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,400
Boo!

32
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,440
Arghhh!

33
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,440
P' Yu!!!

34
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,000
Serves you right!!

35
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,200
P' Yu?

36
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,240
P' Yu!

37
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,240
P' Yu!!

38
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,640
P' Yu!!!

39
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,160
P' Yu!!!!

40
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,640
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,200
I just wanted to get you wet.

42
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,080
P' Yu!

43
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,120
P' Yu!

44
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,880
They call it a natural-born rivalry,

45
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,880
And I never managed to prank him back, not even once.

46
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,760
P' Yu,

47
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,440
Is this funny to you?

48
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,680
It's not bad, do you want to see?

49
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,920
P' Yu, delete it.

50
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,600
Filming others like this is illegal.

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
Do you know PPAP?

52
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,680
PPAP...

53
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,720
Do you mean PDPA?

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,560
I must look so ugly!

55
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,600
It's pretty cute.

56
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
P' Yu, delete it.
No!

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,120
Trust me.

58
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,680
Hey,

59
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,200
What are you looking at, Yo?

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,160
Get your brother out of here.

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,280
I’m taking you.

62
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,440
Father Mark said to get on stage.

63
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,360
Just a minute, just a minute.

64
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm coming, I'm coming.

65
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,040
(Joy to the world,)

66
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:04,600
(the Lord is come Let earth receive her King)

67
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,920
(Let every heart prepare Him room)

68
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,560
(And Heaven and nature sing,)

69
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,240
(And Heaven and nature sing)

70
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,560
(And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing)

71
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,840
(Joy to the World, the Savior reigns!)

72
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,360
(Let men their songs employ)

73
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,720
(While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains)

74
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,080
(Repeat the sounding joy)

75
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,200
(Repeat the sounding joy )

76
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,280
(Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy)

77
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,000
P' Yu.

78
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,680
(The fact that God is willing to reveal His thoughts)

79
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,320
(and His will)

80
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,640
You're playing too much.

81
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,560
(The privilege of receiving such revelations)

82
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,080
(Receiving such revelations)

83
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,720
(is one of the most important gifts)

84
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,040
You don't like it? I thought it was pretty cute.

85
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,480
(that God gives to His children.)

86
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,280
Pretty scary.

87
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,080
It's your birthday, you should stand out.

88
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
P' Yu!

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,800
Shh, keep it down.

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,760
(Revelations come in many ways)

91
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,560
Shh.

92
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,000
(such as dreams, visions)

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,040
(and conversations with heavenly messengers and inspiration)

94
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,720
(Some revelations)

95
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,320
(are received immediately with strong impact)

96
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,680
(and some are gradually perceived subtly over time)

97
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,400
Why are you so upset?

98
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,760
It was just a prank.

99
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,800
Well, I'm embarrassed.

100
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,320
Why?

101
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,480
If you want to write something, why don't you do it on your own face?

102
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,760
Why would you write on others' faces?

103
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,400
Oh, enough already.

104
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,080
You two never stop fighting.

105
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,480
I was going to scold you at church.

106
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,600
Look at P' Yu, Mom.

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
Look at P' Yu, Mom.

108
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,640
P' Yu,

109
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,160
Oh,

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,320
Come on,

111
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,280
it's in the past.

112
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,920
Just let it go.

113
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,880
Wow, both Dad and Mom.

114
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Why do you always take P' Yu's side?

115
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,440
Hey, did you forget what today is?

116
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,960
Hmm.

117
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,720
And what do we have to do?

118
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,040
Huh?

119
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,120
Gifts!

120
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,840
Yeah.

121
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,400
Oh wow.

122
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,520
Last year you already got an iPad.

123
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,200
You're getting another one this year? Give me a break.

124
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,360
Because it's P' Yu, not me.

125
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,160
Alright, alright, all the clues are in the house.

126
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,240
And the first clue is

127
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,760
Round... and always hot.

128
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,120
Think fast!

129
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,920
We'll start in...

130
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:01,880
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go.

131
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,400
Go quickly.

132
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,000
Quickly.

133
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,120
I'll go first.

134
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,280
Let me see too!

135
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,560
No, P' Yu, go look over there.

136
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,040
Go look over there.

137
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,560
This spot is mine.

138
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,520
But if we look together, it'll be clearer.

139
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,800
Wouldn't it be better to help each other?

140
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,920
Have you checked the grey one?

141
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,360
(Round and always hot)

142
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,520
Wait.

143
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,000
No.

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,840
Let me in too!

145
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,760
Close it, close it now.

146
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,680
Don't.

147
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,720
Let me in too!

148
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,200
No way!

149
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,120
Let me in too!

150
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,640
P' Yu, let go.

151
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,120
Go to someone else.

152
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,200
Ai.

153
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,360
Hurry up, open it now.

154
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,400
P' Yu, go look over there.

155
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,240
Open it.

156
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,400
No, I won't open it anymore.

157
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
Go look somewhere else.

158
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,200
Cold and always wet,

159
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,400
Embracing and moist.

160
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,560
Bright and high up.

161
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,960
Dad, Mom, P' Yu, Ing.

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,480
Hey.

163
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,400
Are you okay?

164
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,200
Ai.

165
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,640
Hey, P' Yu, you're bleeding.

166
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,240
Happy birthday to you,

167
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,560
Happy birthday to you,

168
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,160
Happy birthday,

169
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,960
Happy birthday,

170
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,240
Happy birthday to you.

171
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,840
Hmm.

172
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Make a wish.

173
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,880
Alright.

174
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,680
Happy birthday, son.

175
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,240
Happy birthday to you.

176
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,640
Have a very happy birthday.

177
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,160
Thanks.

178
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,720
You're twenty now, all grown up.

179
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,360
Thank you.

180
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,800
Your birthday gift this year,

181
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,040
You’ll have to wait a bit for it.

182
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Let's cut the cake.

183
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,440
Come on, I'm hungry.

184
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,280
P' Yu cheated.

185
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,040
Can't help it.

186
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,320
You're the one who let it go

187
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,880
Mom!

188
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,000
Last year P' Yu already got an iPad.

189
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,640
This year he gets a PlayStation.

190
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,560
Why are you making a fuss?

191
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,200
You'll end up playing with him anyway.

192
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,440
You're right.

193
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,600
Hey, hey, no need to fuss.

194
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,760
Your birthday present.

195
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,120
We've prepared it,

196
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,960
it won't lose to a PlayStation.

197
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,280
Woah.

198
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,560
Here, happy birthday, Ai.

199
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,320
May you achieve success,

200
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,160
And whatever you want to be, may you become.

201
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,120
Thank you, Dad.

202
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,120
Thank you.

203
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,560
Wait, wait, don't open it yet.

204
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,200
I've got something too.

205
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,880
Hey,

206
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,080
It's definitely a back scratcher.

207
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,840
Hey, Ing, don't spoil it.

208
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,120
Yo, anyone who can't guess it is an idiot.

209
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,560
Here, this is from me.

210
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Thanks.

211
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,760
Yours is definitely a book,

212
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,760
A hundred percent.

213
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,720
It's true.

214
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,840
I'll open this one first.

215
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,000
Let's go.

216
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,400
Wow, the hand is coming out.

217
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,040
It's so clear Dad.

218
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,480
Wow, you're good at guessing.

219
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,080
Who is it?

220
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,080
Ingmar Bergman.

221
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,800
He's my favorite director.

222
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,960
You don’t know him?

223
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,040
I do.

224
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,760
They say he's great, right?

225
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,960
Thank you both so much,

226
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,880
for giving me gifts that's absolutely useless to my life.

227
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,160
Now for the main event,

228
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,200
I'm putting a lot of hope into this one.

229
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,480
Let's move on to Mom and Dad's gift.

230
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,760
I'll open it now.

231
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,840
Open it, open it.

232
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,480
Wow, this camera is really expensive.

233
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,120
Take a picture of Mom.

234
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,240
Come on.

235
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,520
Alright, Dad.

236
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,760
One, two...

237
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,360
Everyone, let's take a group photo.

238
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,600
Good, let's take a picture together.

239
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,400
Okay.

240
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,000
Right here.

241
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,160
Alright, everyone stay still.

242
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,200
Like this? Is this good?

243
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,240
Come on.

244
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,000
Stop it.

245
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,000
Hey, what are you doing?

246
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,720
Nothing.

247
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,120
Then why did you come out here?

248
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,960
Just came out to get some fresh air.

249
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,400
Oh.

250
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,640
Is something wrong with you?

251
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,640
I've noticed for a while now.

252
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,320
No,

253
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,040
I just feel strange.

254
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,280
Strange how?

255
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
Well, as we grow up,

256
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,120
It feels like we are forced to follow our dreams.

257
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,040
What do you mean?

258
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,120
Look at you,

259
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,000
you know what you want to do,

260
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,360
What you want to be.

261
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,440
But I don't know myself.

262
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,760
I just want to live my life.

263
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,440
Can't I?

264
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,880
But it's nothing,

265
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,240
I'm just rambling.

266
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,960
I'm here for you.

267
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,440
Yay, I won!!!

268
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,200
Woahhh!

269
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,720
I win! I win!

270
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,600
Why are you so lucky?

271
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,680
How did you fall for some one like Yo?

272
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,200
I have no clue.

273
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,080
Maybe because he seems stupid?

274
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,720
It's true.

275
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,480
It's true?

276
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,200
Yep.

277
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,240
Here he comes.

278
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,840
Hey, do you want to go home? Do you still want me to drop you off?

279
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,240
I have to go and play P' Yu's new game.

280
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,240
If you're in a hurry to go play games

281
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,840
then drop me off at the bus stop;

282
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,920
See you.

283
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:56,960
See you.

284
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,840
Happy Birthday.

285
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,400
Thanks!

286
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
See you.

287
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,800
Let's go.

288
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,080
Yo!

289
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Are you sure you want to go home
yourself at this hour?

290
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,760
It's late, do you want me to drop you off
at your place?

291
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,200
It's okay.

292
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,920
That day, I went home at this time

293
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
and there were still buses.

294
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,800
You know that the buses around here aren't reliable.

295
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Come here and sit on bike.

296
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,840
No girl has ever sat on this!

297
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,160
You know? You're the first person I let sit on this.

298
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,840
Are you going?

299
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,640
No thanks.

300
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
I don't want to be like the girls you're seeing.

301
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,400
You can go, I can go home myself.

302
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,760
Then I'm going.

303
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,240
Well, I told you already, right?

304
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,080
If I didn't come back.

305
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,960
What would you do?

306
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,640
Well, I didn't want to disturb you.

307
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,720
There are no buses at this hour.

308
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,840
I already know.

309
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840
And the bus you got that day was just pure luck.

310
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,760
Come here, come quickly.

311
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,040
If you don't want to disturb me,

312
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,240
I can be a rider for you today.

313
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,680
Hi! I'm Rider Yo!

314
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,160
I'm ready to drop off you with
all 32 parts of your body!

315
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,920
But your heart might be missing.

316
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,760
You're pretty crazy.

317
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,640
Yeah.

318
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,520
Put on the helmet.

319
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
If you say it like that, I wouldn't have accepted
the ride in the first place.

320
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,200
I'd give you one star and report you.

321
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,880
Hold on tight.
