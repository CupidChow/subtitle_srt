00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,000
This series is purely a work of fiction

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,040
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,040
Surprise!

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,040
P' Wann...

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,800
Alright, let me feed you.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,520
You don’t have to worry so much.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,960
How could I not worry? You’re like my younger sibling.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,920
I love you,

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,880
but not as a friend.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,240
You've been with Ai all day today.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,880
Do you like Ai that much?

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,240
I like you, Ai.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,440
I like you very much.

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,440
P' Yu.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,000
I think...

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,600
I like you.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,000
I like you very much.

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,720
P' Yu.

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,920
P' Wann?

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,760
Ai.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,800
Oh, P'Wann.

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,640
What are you doing here alone?

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,480
I just came here to enjoy the view.

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,640
What about you?

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,200
Oh, I brought the guitar for Yo.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,080
I brought the guitar for Yo.

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,680
He wanted to play it.

28
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,800
Can I...

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,440
sit with you?

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
Sure.

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,080
Is your ankle feeling better?

32
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,000
It still...

33
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,040
hurts a little, but it's okay now.

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,200
It's a shame,

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,680
though, getting hurt while on a trip like this.

36
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,800
Yeah...

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,720
It’s...

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,760
pretty quiet, huh?

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,040
Yeah.

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,000
Why?

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,040
Is it because I didn't sing well?

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,240
Or...

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
is it because my breath smells bad?

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,200
No, that's not it.

45
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,600
Uh...

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,480
nothing, really.

47
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll just take my leave now.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,600
Oh.

49
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,160
Are you alright?

50
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,440
Yeah, I'm fine.

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,600
Be careful.

52
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,520
That's beautiful, bro.

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,400
Yeah, it's really beautiful.

54
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,800
P' Wann, look over there.
It's gorgeous, isn't it?

55
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,760
Sure is.

56
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,880
Come on, let's go.

57
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,200
After you.

58
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,040
Ok.
Thank you.

59
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
How do you feel? Tired?

60
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,480
Yeah, I'm really exhausted.

61
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,760
Hey, P' Wann, what are you taking us to do now?

62
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,880
We're going kayaking.

63
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,040
Kayaking?

64
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,920
This way, please.

65
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,520
Let's go.

66
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,040
Come on.

67
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,600
Let's go.

68
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,560
Honestly, I want to play,

69
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,720
but I'll let you guys play instead.

70
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,480
Oh!

71
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,520
It's because the pairs are already matched up.

72
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,400
You take the pictures for us, then.

73
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,160
Alright, alright.

74
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's go, everyone.

75
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,040
I'll take pictures of you when you fall!

76
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,400
Oh, really?

77
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,760
Just wait and see.

78
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,760
Alright, Ai, hop in the boat.

79
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,000
Ai, go, he's inviting you!

80
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,120
Go, he's inviting you, Ai!

81
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,920
Hurry up.

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,680
Ing, you're with me.

83
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,480
Be careful paddling, everyone.

84
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,600
Thank you.

85
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,320
Thanks!

86
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,800
You can follow Yo.

87
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,680
I'll swim after you.

88
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,440
Come on.

89
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't flip.

90
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,400
What?

91
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,880
You’ve got something to say, don’t you?

92
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,160
Is it that obvious to you?

93
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,720
Are you gonna say it or not?

94
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,520
Okay, so let’s say, hypothetically...

95
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,240
Nah, it’s about you.

96
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,320
Hey!

97
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Can you at least let it be hypothetical first?

98
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
Alright, alright, go ahead.

99
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,400
So, imagine I have an older brother, right?

100
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,960
But I’m not telling you who it is.

101
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,000
And he only sees me as his little sibling,

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,360
but he gets hurt whenever he sees me with someone else.

103
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,880
You’re talking about P’ Yu and P’ Wann, aren’t you?

104
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,160
How did you know?

105
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,800
You must think I’m really dumb, huh?

106
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,520
And you saw this in your dreams?

107
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,880
Genius.

108
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,720
Genius, my ass.

109
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,480
Every time you dream,

110
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,200
you tell me he’s hurting.

111
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,440
Yeah, that’s pretty much my answer.

112
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,360
Well,

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,240
if seeing you with P’ Wann hurts him,

114
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,760
Um.

115
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,400
then he must have some feelings for you, right?

116
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,160
Exactly!

117
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,760
I was thinking the same thing.

118
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,120
Wow, my friend’s pretty confident, huh?

119
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,640
So, what are you gonna do next?

120
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,880
I don’t know yet...

121
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,400
But hey, what about you?

122
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,560
You and Yo seem

123
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,800
a bit... off lately.

124
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000
How about you sort out your own situation first?

125
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,960
Hey, come on, I’m just worried about you.

126
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
You should wory about me now,

127
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,800
I’m paddling alone over here.

128
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,200
What? I’m paddling too!

129
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,680
Hmm? You’re barely helping!

130
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,640
Alright, alright, I’m helping now.

131
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,120
By the way, is everything okay, P’ Yu?

132
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,200
You didn’t have a fight with Ai, did you?

133
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,120
No.

134
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,040
We didn’t fight.

135
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,360
But what about you?

136
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,160
Did you get into a fight with Ing?

137
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,240
P' Yu,

138
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Yo,

139
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,400
let's take a picture.

140
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,680
Come on, quickly.

141
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,240
Come.

142
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,920
Come on.

143
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll stand right here.

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,560
Come.

145
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
One, two, three.

146
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,360
Go!

147
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,840
Yay!

148
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,000
Here.

149
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,360
This photo is great; the atmosphere in the picture is amazing.

150
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,240
Look at this!

151
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,760
This right here is the perfect spot to visit!

152
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,400
Wow, doesn’t it look like a place you'd want to go?

153
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,880
Mmm,

154
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,000
look at this!

155
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,040
Going on a trip like this…

156
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,080
You never invite us to go with you.

157
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Well, you guys weren't home.

158
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,160
But I brought you some gifts.

159
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,640
Wow, just bringing some gifts back, huh?

160
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,560
Dad could finish it all by himself.

161
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,000
Uh, Mom?

162
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,240
Isn't that right?

163
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,040
Just kidding.

164
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,240
Ai, fold it up neatly, please.

165
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,640
Oh, but I’m in a rush!

166
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,840
Are you leaving for the volunteer camp tonight or something?

167
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,080
Yep!

168
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,040
Wait, tonight?!

169
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,760
Just kidding!

170
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,640
Oh!

171
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,080
I'm going tomorrow morning, I'm in a hurry because I'm sleepy.

172
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,400
Ah.

173
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,720
Then come on, unpack it, and fold it again.

174
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,200
Mom, no! I already folded it.

175
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,600
Why not? Fold it again.

176
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,800
No, I already did it.

177
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,280
Look, look.

178
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,640
If that's the case,

179
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,160
let's go help Yu and Yo pack their bags instead, huh?

180
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,400
Hmm, okay.

181
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
What is this? Your real kid is sitting right here, you know!

182
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,600
Alright, let's go, Dad.

183
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,200
Oh, come on.

184
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
(Actually happening)

185
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Ai.

186
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,600
Ai, come and eat now.

187
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,600
Ok, mom.

188
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,800
Walk carefully honey.

189
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,880
Yeah.

190
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,880
Mom, what are your kids doing here?

191
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,360
Who are you? Why are you in my house?

192
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,800
Mom!

193
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,520
P' Yu and Yo are all done with packing so I invited them for dinner.

194
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,480
Hmm.

195
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,120
It's a good thing that Dad is the one who loves me in this house.

196
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,120
Who are you?

197
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,280
Dad!

198
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,040
Mom, you too.

199
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,640
I think we should have dinner.

200
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,160
Come on, sit down.

201
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,160
It's probably going to rain, these two are on good terms.

202
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,640
That's over the top, I don't fight with him every day.

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, every single day.

204
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,280
Eat up.

205
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,640
Oh, I wondered who you were getting that for.

206
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,920
What are you watching?

207
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,400
Watching cartoon.

208
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,960
Does your leg still hurt?

209
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,760
It still does.

210
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,400
What are you doing?

211
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,360
Stay still.

212
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,800
It's ok, I can do it myself.

213
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,920
It's ok.

214
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,880
Just lift your leg a bit.

215
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,800
Does it hurt?

216
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,440
All done, put the medicine on it daily.

217
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,200
You're going to walk a lot at camp and hurt your leg again.

218
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:25,960
Yeah.

219
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,560
Put medicine on it, so it'll heal faster.

220
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,400
Sure.

221
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,680
I'm going now.

222
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Bye-bye.

223
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Put medicine on it.

224
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,280
Um.

225
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,200
Bye-bye.

226
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,760
Bye-bye.

227
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,960
Do you want to sit there?

228
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,840
No, go ahead.

229
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,760
How is your leg?

230
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,640
It's all good now, I can walk normally.

231
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,640
That's great.

232
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,560
Thank you...

233
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
for last night.

234
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,800
This is from mom.

235
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,720
Really?

236
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,200
Yeah.

237
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,320
Thank you.

238
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Where did Yo disappear to?

239
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,560
I just saw him walking around here and I don't know where he's gone.

240
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,480
Uh... What about you?

241
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,680
You graduated a long time ago but you're still coming to help?

242
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,400
You're kind of a good person.

243
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Your sandwich looks good, can I have a bite?

244
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,280
Ah.

245
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,720
I meant the sandwich.

246
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Oh, I thought I was going to be eaten.

247
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Are you crazy?

248
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,320
Oh, Yo.

249
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,240
Surprise!

250
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,960
Hi Ai.

251
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,880
We meet again, P' Yu.

252
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah.

253
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
Where is Ing?

254
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,240
The bus is leaving soon.

255
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,080
Uh, I don't know.

256
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,840
I'm here.

257
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,360
What?

258
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,680
When did you get here?

259
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,920
I've been here for a long time.

260
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,600
Help me, everyone!

261
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,840
Help me, I'm being chased by a wolf!

262
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,520
It's coming to eat me now!

263
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,200
It has already eaten my grandmother!

264
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,800
Help me, everyone! Help!

265
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Help! Help!

266
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,160

267
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,480
Come with me, I can help you.

268
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Well, this one is handsome...

269
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,320
and this one... is also handsome.

270
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
Come with me, I will save you.

271
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,920
Come with me, I can help you as well.

272
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,800
Come with me, it's better.

273
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,400
Come with me!

274
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,560
I said come with me!

275
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Come with me!

276
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,640
Come with me!!

277
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,080
Come with me!!!!

278
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,080
I said, come with me!

279

Come with me.

280

281
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,320
Ugh, enough already!
