00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,854
This series is purely a work of fiction

2
00:00:16,854 --> 00:00:20,172
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

3
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:25,712
I love you.

4
00:00:27,873 --> 00:00:28,659
I know.

5
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:32,977
I think it’s time, Ai.

6
00:00:34,282 --> 00:00:35,019
Time for what?

7
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:40,235
P' Yu.

8
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:48,449
Is this real?

9
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:51,669
Ai.

10
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:53,716
Marry me.

11
00:00:57,776 --> 00:00:59,776
Please answer me.

12
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:22,453
Is this you, tiny one?

13
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:23,037
Yo!

14
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:24,422
Missed!

15
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:26,228
(Ai)

16
00:01:31,544 --> 00:01:33,787
Can’t reach it, what should I do?

17
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:36,041
Is someone kind enough to grab it for me?

18
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:37,327
You’re being so dramatic.

19
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:38,354
Can you grab it for me?

20
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:44,000
Who’s calling?

21
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:45,480
It’s Ai.

22
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:52,615
Ing, I had a dream.

23
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:54,788
Oh my gosh, something new again.

24
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:56,388
Are you still excited?

25
00:01:56,927 --> 00:01:59,373
No, not really, but this dream is different.

26
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:03,383
I dreamt that P’ Yu proposed to me.

27
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:04,016
Huh?

28
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:08,201
I’m nervous, seriously.

29
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:09,751
What if he really proposes to me?

30
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,133
What will I do?

31
00:02:13,144 --> 00:02:15,484
How can you be sure it’ll come true?

32
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:19,588
I don’t know.

33
00:02:19,947 --> 00:02:21,364
Maybe it won’t happen.

34
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:23,623
Aren’t you stressed about writing your script lately?

35
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:27,656
Yeah, I am.

36
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:30,352
I’m stressed about the travel project.

37
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,539
I can’t think of anything, and the deadline is tight.

38
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,583
Well, we’ll gather some info again tomorrow.

39
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,527
Okay, fine.

40
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:42,167
I’ll get back to work now.

41
00:02:42,477 --> 00:02:43,797
Sure, see you later.

42
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,892
Go work. See you tomorrow.

43
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,158
Yeah.

44
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:58,862
Shall we play a game again?

45
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:01,412
Yay! I won!

46
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:04,633
Of course, you cheated again.

47
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:06,230
I was just on the phone for a second!

48
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,154
That’s irrelevant, but the loser has to get a kiss, right?

49
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:10,093
You’re making that up.

50
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:10,718
Come here!

51
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:12,058
Yo!

52
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,772
Just one kiss!

53
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:13,440
Yo!

54
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,000
Just one kiss!

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,500
Yo!

56
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:28,461
(How to prepare for a proposal)

57
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:46,365
Ouch!

58
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:06,111
What are you doing?

59
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:09,237
Packing, obviously.

60
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:11,978
P' Yu,

61
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:13,704
When did you get here?

62
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:16,284
I’ve been here since you tried on your suit.

63
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:21,892
And do you need to bring a suit to Bang Saen?

64
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:22,656
Well...

65
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,458
And what’s with all the clothes all over the bed?

66
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,704
Just trying them out.

67
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,054
Wanted to see which ones look good.

68
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,946
Do you really need to try on so many?

69
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:35,185
I just don’t know which one to wear.

70
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,766
But anyway...

71
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:46,087
Where have you been? Why are you back so late?

72
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:48,682
I was working.

73
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:50,601
Really?

74
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:51,327
Yeah.

75
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:54,406
Anything wrong?

76
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:57,652
No, nothing.

77
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,979
Go take a shower, it’s late.

78
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:02,770
Okay.

79
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:04,920
I'll go shower.

80
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,438
Yeah.

81
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:09,243
Ai.

82
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:11,440
Yes?

83
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
I ran into your parents earlier.

84
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:17,637
They asked me to buy some sweet sticky rice bamboo on the way back.

85
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,160
Why are you so startled?

86
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,393
Nothing.

87
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:26,713
No reason.

88
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:30,086
Go take a shower, it’s late.

89
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,644
Alright, alright.

90
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:34,800
Take care of the bag for me, okay?

91
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:35,851
Sure.

92
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:08,602
P' Yu, are you okay?

93
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,850
What do you mean?

94
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:45,835
Ai.

95
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,880
Hmm?

96
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,120
I think...

97
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,161
we should break up.

98
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,440
P' Yu.

99
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:00,560
Why?

100
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:02,960
No, we’re not breaking up.

101
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,932
Ai.

102
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:04,881
No, we’re not breaking up.

103
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:06,389
Can’t we just break up?

104
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:08,280
Why, P' Yu?

105
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:10,193
P' Yu.

106
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,440
P' Yu.

107
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:13,285
P' Yu.

108
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:13,820
P' Yu.

109
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,120
Hey!

110
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:16,437
Not real.

111
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:18,960
What did you dream about this time?

112
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:23,520
What? I wasn’t dreaming.
I was startled by your faces.

113
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,720
I know you were dreaming, no need to lie.

114
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:27,240
You think you’re so clever, huh?

115
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,247
Umm.

116
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:32,547
I want to be clever too.

117
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:39,563
Focus on driving, will you?

118
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:45,240
I’m hungry!

119
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:48,058
See? I knew it.

120
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:50,047
I told you to buy food, but you didn’t listen.

121
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:51,941
Now look, what happened.

122
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:54,388
I have snacks in the back, I bought them.

123
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:54,992
Go ahead, help yourself.

124
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:04,878
My brother knows me so well.

125
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:08,314
P' Yu, what do you want to eat?

126
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:11,347
I’ll take this one.

127
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,560
Just for you, Ing.

128
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:18,640
Ever played this as a kid?

129
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:22,672
Where do they stick this snack on your finger and propose?

130
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:27,362
Let me put a ring on you, P' Yu.

131
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:31,369
No, it’ll get your hands dirty.

132
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:42,203
Ai, let’s break up.

133
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,652
This one’s so beautiful.

134
00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:56,719
Wow, really gorgeous.

135
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:16,001
Will it look as good in pictures?

136
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:17,435
It’s kind of dark here.

137
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
One, two...

138
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:22,640
Smile, smile!

139
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,701
One, two, three.

140
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:29,360
One, two, three.

141
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:31,423
One, two, three.

142
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,413
Whoa, Yo, too close!

143
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:35,472
Get it right!

144
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:36,528
Come here, come here.

145
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,209
It feels nice outside.

146
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:41,621
Right?

147
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:44,400
Here we go, here we go.

148
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,889
One, two, three.

149
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:47,886
Help us out here, come on!

150
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:48,760
Wow, so many cameras.

151
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,070
Yeah, that’s it.

152
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:02,866
Whoa, what the heck?

153
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,120
Ing.

154
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:09,200
I dreamt that P' Yu broke up with me.

155
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,806
Huh?

156
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:14,800
You and P' Yu seemed fine before.

157
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:19,143
Why don’t you just get engaged already?

158
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:21,625
P' Yu will propose to you soon.

159
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:23,360
For real?

160
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, trust me.

161
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:28,890
Alright, I trust you.

162
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:32,845
Ai.

163
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:35,320
Oh no.

164
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:39,579
Why don’t you just walk over there?

165
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:42,857
I’m just taking some photos for research.

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,883
Yeah.

167
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:45,839
Are you done?

168
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:46,918
Yeah, all done.

169
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,797
Let’s go then.

170
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:48,576
Okay.

171
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:55,658
Wow.

172
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:02,033
Ai.

173
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:03,570
What were you and Ing talking about earlier?

174
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,708
You two seemed so excited.

175
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:06,160
I’m not telling.

176
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,090
Oh!

177
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,680
When will you ask me?

178
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:15,240
Ask what, Ai?

179
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,963
Ask...

180
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:18,667
Ask...

181
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:22,760
Ask if I can post this picture on Instagram.

182
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:25,502
Your picture.

183
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:27,120
Oh,

184
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:29,956
you’re sneaking pictures of me now?

185
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,037
Your photography skills are improving.

186
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:34,960
Must be a good teacher.

187
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
Are you complimenting me or yourself?

188
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:44,000
It’s beautiful here, huh?

189
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:45,724
Shall we take a group photo?

190
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:51,200
Ing, Yo, group photo?

191
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:52,119
Quick!

192
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,977
Come on, bro.

193
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:56,012
Face that way.

194
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:59,781
Excuse me,

195
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:01,299
can you take a photo for us?

196
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:02,197
Sure.

197
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,801
Oh, you can use my phone.

198
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:05,680
Got it.

199
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,748
Come on.

200
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,148
Come on.

201
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,230
Get closer, everyone.

202
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:14,447
One, two...

203
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:15,217
Hold on a second.

204
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:32,440
Sorry, my shoelace came undone.

205
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,532
Let me help you with that.

206
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:42,693
Thanks.

207
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:44,056
All set now.

208
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,650
One, two, three.

209
00:13:58,027 --> 00:14:00,221
You guys can go ahead and walk around.

210
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:02,679
I’ll stay back to take some more pictures for research.

211
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,036
Sure, we’ll wait over there.

212
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:07,141
Okay.

213
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:08,400
I’m coming with you.

214
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:10,640
Of course, I’ll go too.

215
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:12,591
See you later.

216
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:13,091
See you.

217
00:14:15,697 --> 00:14:17,200
What about you, P' Yu?

218
00:14:19,385 --> 00:14:20,171
I’ll go with Ai.

219
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:21,441
Okay, let’s go.

220
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:28,942
This one’s pretty big, huh?

221
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:30,942
Whoa, looks like none of these are dead yet.

222
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:32,003
Here it is.

223
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:32,935
Take a look if you’d like.

224
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:33,503
Sure.

225
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:36,572
Wow.

226
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,840
Should we buy it and grill it?

227
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,681
Feel free to ask if you need anything.

228
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:44,588
What do you want to get?

229
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:46,279
Take your time choosing.

230
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:47,904
Feeding me again, huh?

231
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:50,910
It tastes good.

232
00:14:57,221 --> 00:14:58,541
Oh.

233
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:12,280
Ai.

234
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,006
One, two...

235
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:17,560
Whoa, what’s up? I'm working.

236
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,835
I’m doing my job.

237
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:20,596
Is that true?

238
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:21,431
Yeah.

239
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:32,959
Ai.

240
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:34,680
Have I ever told you?

241
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,534
What?

242
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,310
I like it when you work.

243
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,591
You look so focused,

244
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:44,287
it’s cute.

245
00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:47,680
Stop, how can you say that so bluntly?

246
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:55,160
I have something for you.

247
00:15:55,677 --> 00:15:57,677
I haven’t had a chance to give it to you properly yet.

248
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:59,090
Let me grab it.

249
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,967
Ta-da!

250
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:12,524
It’s a portable fan, and it’s adjustable!

251
00:16:12,524 --> 00:16:13,247
Here.

252
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:15,706
Do you like it?

253
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,324
Here, take it.

254
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:38,215
Some ice cream...

255
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:41,421
might help relieve your stress.

256
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:48,115
Where are Ing and Yo?

257
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:50,817
Oh, over there.

258
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:52,396
They’re taking pictures.

259
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:59,492
What are you thinking about?

260
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,780
You’ve seemed stressed since this morning.

261
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:04,551
I’ve just been...

262
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:06,712
thinking about some stuff.

263
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,837
Work stuff?

264
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,541
Partly works, but...

265
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:17,094
After this, should we head back to the hotel?

266
00:17:17,944 --> 00:17:18,778
Sure.

267
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:22,520
I picked this place to stay for a few days, after all.

268
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:37,490
It’s not coming off, is it?

269
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,157
Hold on, I’ll be right back.

270
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:53,120
Here.

271
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:54,603
Change into this.

272
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,440
But...

273
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,759
Go ahead, the shirt’s all dirty now.

274
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:03,240
Why did you buy two shirts, P’ Yu?

275
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:08,700
Because I’ll change too.

276
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:15,810
Do you like it?

277
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,601
Yeah.

278
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:20,920
All done.

279
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,600
So cute.

280
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:26,001
I don’t think it’s my fault.

281
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:28,003
Look at this, the picture’s not great.

282
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:29,734
I don’t think it’s the camera.

283
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:34,000
Hey!

284
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,760
You’re wearing matching shirts!

285
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:38,497
How does it look?

286
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,965
Why, do you want to wear one too?

287
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:44,801
No.

288
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:46,160
Really?

289
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:48,721
Hmph.

290
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:55,920
Hello.

291
00:19:01,882 --> 00:19:02,749
Hello.

292
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:03,614
Hi.

293
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:04,453
Hello.

294
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:06,388
We booked two rooms.

295
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,074
Oh, two rooms, right?

296
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:08,785
One moment, please.

297
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:14,000
Here you go.

298
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:15,360
Thanks.

299
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,586
Room 207 and 307.
You can take the lift on the right.

300
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:19,220
Thanks.

301
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,289
Nueng!

302
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:22,670
Yes?

303
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,001
Help carry the bags for the guests.

304
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:25,354
Of course.

305
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,030
May I have the bag, please?

306
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,772
Here you go.

307
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,233
Thank you.

308
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:40,309
Excuse me.

309
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:41,576
Yeah.

310
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:42,324
Thank you.

311
00:19:42,324 --> 00:19:43,627
It's a bit heavy.

312
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:44,127
Yes.

313
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:48,779
This way, please.

314
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:49,392
Sure.

315
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:50,548
Thank you.

316
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:51,197
Thanks.

317
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,050
So tired.

318
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:15,600
What are you doing, P' Yu?

319
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:17,266
Why?

320
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,768
Are you going to take a picture, Ai?

321
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:21,132
I'll arrange it for you.

322
00:20:21,484 --> 00:20:23,160
No… no need.

323
00:20:25,052 --> 00:20:25,644
Really?

324
00:20:32,795 --> 00:20:35,281
By the way, the market you mentioned…

325
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:38,308
The one you specifically picked for us.

326
00:20:39,247 --> 00:20:41,720
Oh, I didn’t tell you why, did I?

327
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:48,256
Here.

328
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:54,744
Shall we go together?

329
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:59,625
Maybe you’ll get some new ideas for your work.

330
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:03,231
Hmm, thanks.

331
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:10,248
How about you change the thanks to…

332
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,487
this?

333
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,000
No need,

334
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,076
I’m going to the bathroom now.

335
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:16,214
Hey, wait.

336
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:37,560
Where should I put this?

337
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,913
You can leave it with me.

338
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:40,505
Okay.

339
00:21:40,505 --> 00:21:41,437
Thanks.

340
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:42,878
You’re welcome,

341
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:46,520
feel free to ask if you need anything.

342
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:47,860
Yes.

343
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:50,432
Excuse me.

344
00:22:10,632 --> 00:22:11,466
I saw it earlier.

345
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,560
Saw what?

346
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,527
He was looking at you.

347
00:22:18,663 --> 00:22:19,400
Jealous?

348
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:22,446
I don’t like it.

349
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:25,068
Jealous, huh?

350
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:27,911
Don’t laugh!

351
00:22:28,688 --> 00:22:30,000
Fine, I'm jealous.

352
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,834
Come here.

353
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,130
Hey, Yo, what are you doing?

354
00:22:35,603 --> 00:22:36,535
What do you want me to do?

355
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:38,320
Or do you want to be punished?

356
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:42,075
No, Yo, no.

357
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:43,166
Yo!

358
00:22:44,242 --> 00:22:44,882
Yo, don’t!

359
00:22:44,882 --> 00:22:46,135
Yo, no!

360
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:47,217
Yo!

361
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,166
Yo!

362
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:48,888
I’m going to punish you.

363
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:49,623
Yo, stop!

364
00:22:49,623 --> 00:22:50,805
Hey, Yo!

365
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:53,797
Hello everyone, my name is P' Mook.

366
00:22:53,797 --> 00:22:56,835
Today, I’m going to teach you how to make Miang Kuay Teow.

367
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:58,390
Miang Kuay Teow,

368
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,511
is a famous dish from Ban Bueng, Chonburi.

369
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:06,374
The ingredients include mackerel, pickled radish, and dried shrimp.

370
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,856
And most importantly, you can’t forget this.

371
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,209
Noodle sheets cut into small squares,

372
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:13,576
bite-sized.

373
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:17,120
When will it be done if you keep staring?

374
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:18,452
Here, take it.

375
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:19,957
Take it.

376
00:23:21,286 --> 00:23:21,878
Don’t!

377
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:26,280
You look like you just stepped out of
a Y-series drama!

378
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:28,160
Thank you.

379
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:31,440
Wow, it looks delicious.

380
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:31,990
Right?

381
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,756
Yeah.

382
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:36,160
No need to be shy, I’m a sapphic too.

383
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:41,381
Can I pour the sauce on this side?

384
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:42,008
No, I’m good.

385
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:42,930
Whoa!

386
00:23:43,696 --> 00:23:44,196
How’s it going?

387
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:45,118
Good, he's talented.

388
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:47,219
Hey, how did you get here?

389
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:49,767
No, I should be the one asking.

390
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:50,773
How did you get here?

391
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:53,578
I just finished work and thought I’d come
to see my girlfriend.

392
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:58,353
How’s the room?

393
00:23:58,755 --> 00:24:00,075
Oh, I love it.

394
00:24:00,075 --> 00:24:00,795
It’s beautiful.

395
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:01,295
Yeah.

396
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:01,999
Good.

397
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:05,422
Take care of the guys for me.

398
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:06,575
No problem.

399
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:07,109
I'll go settle the bill.

400
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:07,652
Alright.

401
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:14,960
This is the Miang Kuay Teow recipe from P' Noi.

402
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,460
Really?

403
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,923
Do you know what the secret is?

404
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:19,127
It’s the sauce!

405
00:24:21,754 --> 00:24:22,686
Don’t forget.

406
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:26,025
Got it.

407
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:27,489
Put the whole thing in.

408
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:29,245
That’s a beautiful ring.

409
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,228
Thanks,

410
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:33,418
I...

411
00:24:35,312 --> 00:24:36,292
love it.

412
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:39,287
How long have you two been together?

413
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:43,840
Wow, about four or five years now.

414
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,678
Really?

415
00:24:44,678 --> 00:24:45,178
Yes.

416
00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:47,038
Good, stay together for a long time.

417
00:24:47,744 --> 00:24:48,600
Thanks.

418
00:24:49,163 --> 00:24:51,720
I’ll excuse myself to check on the other tables.

419
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,220
Oh, sure.

420
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,853
Feel free.

421
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,000
Will do.

422
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:08,200
One, two, three.

423
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,097
Hey, smile!

424
00:25:09,892 --> 00:25:11,892
One, two, three… umm.

425
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:12,929
How’s that?

426
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,248
One, two, three. Looks good.

427
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:17,052
One, two, three.

428
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,780
Iced Americano is ready.

429
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,517
Thank you.

430
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:30,462
I didn’t order this cake.

431
00:25:32,101 --> 00:25:35,169
This is a special cake from the hotel.

432
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:36,651
We’d like you to try it,

433
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:38,800
free of charge.

434
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:40,532
Oh.

435
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,571
Did you order this for me, love?

436
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:49,800
Looks delicious.

437
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:55,960
If you need anything, just let me know.

438
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,196
Enjoy your meal.

439
00:25:58,196 --> 00:25:58,785
Sure.

440
00:25:58,785 --> 00:25:59,740
Thank you.

441
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,000
What’s up, love?

442
00:26:10,674 --> 00:26:14,280
I wanted to say it loudly so people know we’re together.

443
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,084
Here, I’ll feed you, love.

444
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:24,274
Open wide!

445
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:28,000
Is it good?

446
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:34,600
Um, Ai told me…

447
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,198
Ai dreamed that P' Yu proposed.

448
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:40,160
Why? Do you want to get married too?

449
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,373
Yeah, of course.

450
00:26:41,373 --> 00:26:43,647
I’m pregnant with your child.

451
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:44,190
Look!

452
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,811
Ouch! So, I’m going to be a dad, huh?

453
00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:48,683
Ouch, stop it.

454
00:26:50,293 --> 00:26:51,662
Let’s take more photos.

455
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,076
Alright, let's do it.

456
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:54,270
Can I take a picture with the cake?

457
00:26:56,238 --> 00:26:59,258
Okay, come here. One, two, three.

458
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:19,720
P' Yu.

459
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:20,778
Yes?

460
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:26,827
I forgot my phone charger.

461
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:28,492
Can I borrow yours?

462
00:27:29,843 --> 00:27:30,677
Sure.

463
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:32,906
It's in my bag, so grab it.

464
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:50,280
Did you find it?

465
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:56,001
Oh,

466
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:00,529
I just remembered I have mine.

467
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:02,407
Oh, okay.

468
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:05,102
Here it is.

469
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:06,810
Okay.

470
00:28:24,222 --> 00:28:25,120
Going to sleep?

471
00:28:26,594 --> 00:28:27,094
Yeah,

472
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:28,787
I’m sleepy.

473
00:28:45,313 --> 00:28:46,973
Goodnight, love.

474
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:50,191
I love you, Ai.

475
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:03,311
I love too.

476
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:06,910
Goodnight.

477
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,126
P' Yu.

478
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,347
P' Yu.

479
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,881
What are you doing, can’t sleep?

480
00:30:22,034 --> 00:30:24,600
When did you wake up, P' Yu?

481
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:28,433
I woke up and didn’t see you,

482
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,147
so I came looking.

483
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:32,080
Are you okay?

484
00:30:34,216 --> 00:30:35,050
Yeah.

485
00:30:38,073 --> 00:30:38,573
Really?

486
00:30:39,483 --> 00:30:39,983
Mhm.

487
00:30:47,854 --> 00:30:48,840
Ai.

488
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,531
Boo!

489
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:50,290
P' Yu, stop!

490
00:30:52,015 --> 00:30:52,558
Hey!

491
00:30:54,878 --> 00:30:56,198
A..Ai...

492
00:30:57,962 --> 00:30:58,991
Sorry,

493
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,403
let me pick that up.

494
00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:20,161
P' Yu,

495
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,266
Ai…

496
00:34:04,506 --> 00:34:05,146
Yu.

497
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:05,986
Yes.

498
00:34:05,986 --> 00:34:08,921
Do you, Yu, take Ai to be your partner for life?

499
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:17,732
Do you promise to be loyal to them in good times and bad,

500
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:21,819
in sickness and in health,

501
00:34:22,452 --> 00:34:26,540
and to love and honor them all your life?

502
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:30,926
I do.

503
00:34:32,459 --> 00:34:36,547
Do you, Ai, take Yu to be your partner for life?

504
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:41,600
I do.

505
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,160
Yu, please place the ring on Ai’s finger.

506
00:35:12,238 --> 00:35:15,598
Ai, please place the ring on Yu’s finger.

507
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:27,520
Ai, can you control your dreams now, honey?

508
00:36:32,908 --> 00:36:39,084
Do you know you can go back to any moment you want in your dream?

509
00:36:44,032 --> 00:36:45,080
Really, Mom?

510
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:48,240
Focus.

511
00:36:54,871 --> 00:37:01,360
Gather your focus and think of the moment you want to return to.

512
00:37:02,173 --> 00:37:03,687
And then…

513
00:37:24,516 --> 00:37:27,960
Yu, please place the ring on Ai’s finger.

514
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:49,539
Ai, please place the ring on Yu’s finger.

515
00:38:21,422 --> 00:38:22,305
P' Yu.

516
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:24,800
P' Yu.

517
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:39,407
Ai.

518
00:38:55,184 --> 00:38:55,776
Ai.

519
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:57,840
Ai.

520
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:26,526
P' Yu.

521
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:57,558
Mom, Dad.

522
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,094
Ing,

523
00:40:08,374 --> 00:40:09,111
Yo,

524
00:40:16,183 --> 00:40:16,683
Ai!

525
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:23,901
Ai!

526
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:50,812
Hey, Ai!

527
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:52,896
Ai, wait.

528
00:40:52,896 --> 00:40:53,981
Ai!

529
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:55,067
Ai, don’t.

530
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,557
How did you get into my dream?

531
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:12,630
I... I don’t know.

532
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:15,758
But what were you about to do, Ai?

533
00:41:18,299 --> 00:41:20,299
I just wanted to be with you, P' Yu.

534
00:41:23,374 --> 00:41:24,694
But I’m right here.

535
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:27,000
Not like that.

536
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:32,449
I dreamed that you were going to break up with me, P' Yu.

537
00:41:32,902 --> 00:41:36,000
And you were mad at me last night.

538
00:41:37,841 --> 00:41:39,258
I was scared.

539
00:42:00,152 --> 00:42:02,443
I don’t know what you saw in your dream, Ai.

540
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:05,397
But there's one thing I can guarantee.

541
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:10,407
I will never leave you.

542
00:42:16,464 --> 00:42:17,493
Okay?

543
00:42:23,385 --> 00:42:26,648
Now, let’s get ready...

544
00:42:28,072 --> 00:42:30,072
and go to a place together.

545
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,251
What are they doing?

546
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:42,905
Hmm, I don’t know.

547
00:42:55,721 --> 00:42:56,367
P' Yu.

548
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:01,137
Sorry.

549
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:04,923
Sorry for what, Ai?

550
00:43:08,888 --> 00:43:10,451
I had a dream.

551
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:14,000
That you were going to propose to me, P' Yu.

552
00:43:14,524 --> 00:43:15,310
Hmm.

553
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:19,948
So I got my hopes up for this trip.

554
00:43:21,324 --> 00:43:26,160
But then the dream changed, and you were going to break up with me.

555
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,260
It made me worry.

556
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,840
I’m really hurt by that.

557
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:38,546
You think I’d break up with you for real?

558
00:43:38,546 --> 00:43:40,074
Well, I dreamed…

559
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:46,995
Sorry for being so silly, P' Yu.

560
00:43:49,516 --> 00:43:51,516
Who said you were silly?

561
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,143
I did.

562
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,294
I think...

563
00:44:30,107 --> 00:44:31,184
it’s time.

564
00:44:32,686 --> 00:44:34,000
Time for what, P' Yu?

565
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:37,775
P' Yu.

566
00:44:45,863 --> 00:44:46,455
Ai.

567
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:49,345
Will you marry me?

568
00:44:57,814 --> 00:44:59,360
What do I say?

569
00:45:05,029 --> 00:45:06,592
Yes.

570
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:13,692
Wow, you’re handing over just like that?

571
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:21,092
Congratulations!

572
00:45:21,092 --> 00:45:23,195
Stay together for a long time!

573
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:25,807
Wait, you guys knew about this?

574
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,573
Yeah, we’ve known for a while.

575
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:28,891
Everyone all knew.

576
00:45:29,848 --> 00:45:30,828
You’re good at hiding it.

577
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:33,280
(Kiss!)

578
00:45:34,419 --> 00:45:35,351
Do you like it?

579
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,880
Where did you get this?

580
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,477
Not telling.

581
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:39,640
When did you get it?

582
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,236
Not telling.

583
00:45:51,771 --> 00:45:52,703
I love you, Ai.

584
00:45:53,705 --> 00:45:55,122
I also love you.

585
00:45:58,797 --> 00:45:59,680
So cute.

586
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,403
Beautiful.

587
00:46:15,743 --> 00:46:16,243
Really?

588
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:18,278
Show your friends.

589
00:46:21,263 --> 00:46:22,720
Wow, that’s a beautiful ring!

590
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,811
P' Yu, buy one for me too.

591
00:46:28,317 --> 00:46:30,040
It’s nice, really cute.

592
00:46:39,801 --> 00:46:41,558
Did you ever play that game as a kid,

593
00:46:41,558 --> 00:46:45,101
where you put candy rings on your fingers and propose?

594
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:49,680
Let me put this ring on you, P' Yu.

595
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,898
No, Ai.

596
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,080
It might get your hands dirty.

597
00:47:25,401 --> 00:47:26,673
I have something for you.

598
00:47:27,013 --> 00:47:28,844
I haven’t had a good chance to give it to you yet.

599
00:47:29,572 --> 00:47:30,360
Let me get it.

600
00:47:35,178 --> 00:47:36,960
Ta-da!

601
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,927
A portable fan!

602
00:47:39,698 --> 00:47:42,320
I forgot the phone charger.

603
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,924
Can I borrow yours?

604
00:47:43,924 --> 00:47:46,488
Sure, it's in my bag.

605
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,490
Grab it.

606
00:47:56,361 --> 00:47:57,146
Did you find it?

607
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:04,974
I just remembered that I brought my charger.

608
00:48:06,424 --> 00:48:07,200
P' Yu.

609
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,960
Have you been watching all along?

610
00:48:32,683 --> 00:48:33,469
Yeah.

611
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:35,515
With that big of a reaction,

612
00:48:35,515 --> 00:48:37,560
it would be hard for anyone not to notice.

613
00:48:39,686 --> 00:48:41,686
For the crime of teasing.

614
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:46,795
Wait, hold on! Let me defend myself a little.

615
00:48:47,473 --> 00:48:49,182
I wasn’t trying to tease you, Ai.

616
00:48:49,981 --> 00:48:51,200
But...

617
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:51,899
What?

618
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:05,044
But you were excited, right?

619
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,880
Because I was going to propose.

620
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,519
I was excited too.

621
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:25,400
Ai.

622
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:26,634
Hmm?

623
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:28,671
From now on,

624
00:49:31,037 --> 00:49:34,882
our wedding won’t just be a dream anymore.

625
00:49:39,172 --> 00:49:40,520
Because it’s going to be real.

626
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:49,118
P' Yu.

627
00:49:51,351 --> 00:49:52,428
I love you, P' Yu.

628
00:50:01,394 --> 00:50:03,054
I love you even more.

629
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,000
Touching, isn’t it?

630
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,702
Yeah, touching.

631
00:50:16,676 --> 00:50:18,336
Or do you want to be touched too?

632
00:50:18,886 --> 00:50:20,000
Let me just say this.

633
00:50:21,532 --> 00:50:22,512
It won’t be long.

634
00:50:24,962 --> 00:50:27,600
Fine, I’ll wait.
