This series is purely a work of fiction

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,040
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,600
(Did not happen)

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,640
(Happened in reality)

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,360
P' Yu.

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,400
P' Yu.

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,360
Ai.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,280
P' Yu.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,000
(now I’ve dreamed of someone I love being in danger.)

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,400
I want to find this woman.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,440
P’ Yu,

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,920
wake up.

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,800
Wake up now.

14
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Wait a second, Ai.

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,680
Not yet, give me five more minutes.

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Make that fifteen minutes.

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,080
Never mind, I’ve changed my mind.

18
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,520
You’re not going anywhere today.

19
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,120
Ai, punish me a little.

20
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,800
No.

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,280
Ai, punish me first.

22
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,000
Then I’ll let go.

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,000
P’ Yu,

24
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,760
Yo has a championship match today.

25
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,760
Aren’t you going to go?

26
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,640
You didn’t go last time either.

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
You promised Yo, didn’t you?

28
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,960
Hmm...

29
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,760
I’m too lazy.

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,840
Come on, get up.

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,400
Fine, I’ll get up.

32
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,200
Come on.

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,640
Hey, P’ Yu, what are you doing?

34
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,040
Let’s shower together.

35
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
No, P’ Yu, let go.

36
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Let go!

37
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,080
You’re cute like this.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,160
Get dressed now.

39
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,680
I’ll dress you.

40
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,040
Here,

41
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,920
put your head in.

42
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,560
Tuck your shirt in, too.

43
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,040
Okay.

44
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,120
If you do this, it might give me some trouble.

45
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,000
What?

46
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Enough already.

47
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,760
You’re still messing around.

48
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,160
Come on, dad and mom are waiting to have breakfast.

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,360
Really?

50
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Yeah, hurry up.

51
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,760
Come on.

52
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,040
Hey, P’ Yu.

53
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,720
How’s Yo doing?

54
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,680
It just started a little while ago.

55
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,040
Go, Yo, fight!

56
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,760
Hit it!

57
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,440
Go, Yo!

58
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,400
Go, Yo, spike it!

59
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,880
Great job!

60
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,040
Yo was amazing today, Mom.

61
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,720
Just like dad in his younger days.

62
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,760
Really?

63
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
But seriously, you were really good.

64
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,480
We're are sorry we couldn’t come to cheer for you.

65
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,880
It’s okay. I understand.

66
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,840
Here, Yo, eat a lot, okay?

67
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,520
Pass me your plate quickly, and I’ll serve you.

68
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
You were the star today,

69
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,320
so eat up.

70
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay.

71
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,840
Give me some too.

72
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,680
Hmm.

73
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,480
Why would I give protein to someone who
spends all day sleeping not using energy?

74
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,160
Mom, people who sleep get hungry too, you know.

75
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,280
Here, take mine.

76
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,160
See?

77
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,880
That’s how it should be.

78
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,560
Annoying.

79
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,120
You, eat a lot, okay?

80
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,840
Eat a lot!
No!!

81
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,960
Mom!
Eat your veggies!

82
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,280
No veggies!

83
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,400
If you don’t eat them, don’t call me mom!

84
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,120
Aoi.

85
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,160
Huh?

86
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,960
You’re calling me Aoi instead of Mom!

87
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,480
Watch it!

88
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,920
But you told me to do that!

89
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,120
Watch out!

90
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,920
Everyone,

91
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,440
Hmm?

92
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,480
Let’s celebrate Yo’s championship win!

93
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,720
Hmm, let’s do it.

94
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,840
Holding the trophy!

95
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,040
Have to be proud!

96
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
One, two, three!

97
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,160
I wondered where you went.

98
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Today, I wish my parents could’ve seen me play.

99
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,720
I think they did.

100
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,360
I just wish they would tell me...

101
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,360
that they’re proud of me.

102
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,920
They must be proud of you already.

103
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,160
Even though I’m not your mom or dad,

104
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,640
I want to tell you...

105
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,960
I’m so incredibly proud of you.

106
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,360
Uh, thanks.

107
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,440
You’ve done great.

108
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,840
Don’t overthink it.

109
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
You’ve done great.

110
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,160
Harder!

111
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,560
Harder!

112
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,720
Swing it all the way 360 degrees!

113
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
It’s not just me, you know.

114
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,520
Everyone’s proud of you.

115
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,760
Uh...Mom and Dad,

116
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,120
you guys can rest.

117
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,480
I’ll clean up.

118
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,160
Are you sure, son?

119
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,360
It’s okay, Mom.

120
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,000
P’ Yu and I will clean together.

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,760
Just setting the table was a huge help, thanks so much.

122
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,840
Alright, then!

123
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,880
Help each other clean up, okay?

124
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,600
Of course.

125
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,360
I’m going to rest now.

126
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,160
Heading out.

127
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
I’m exhausted.

128
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,640
You okay, Dad? You’re wobbling.

129
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,160
Come on.

130
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,440
P’ Yu, Yo’s going to help Ing out.

131
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,360
He’s not doing so well.

132
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,480
That joke’s old, Yo.

133
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,440
Come on. Just a second.

134
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,000
Just a sec, he’s not doing well at all.

135
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,200
What a state.

136
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,320
Okay, okay,

137
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,680
Got it.

138
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,920
Hey,

139
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,560
Hey,

140
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,720
Wake up.

141
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
You woke up early.

142
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,440
Good morning!

143
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,240
What did you eat?

144
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,480
Hey, be careful!

145
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,920
Watch your step!

146
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,280
I’m fine, I’m fine.

147
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,280
Go back to your room, then.

148
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,320
Come on, Ing, time to go.

149
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,440
Let’s go,

150
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,840
hang on to me.

151
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,320
Take care.

152
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,160
See you!

153
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,080
Bye-bye!

154
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,000
Bye!

155
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,840
I wish we could all be this happy forever.

156
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,120
I promise, Ai.

157
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
I’ll make sure you’re this happy forever.

158
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,080
I don’t believe you.

159
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
I know.

160
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,240
Thanks.

161
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,880
Alright,

162
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,480
That's it.

163
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Let’s start our happiness now.

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,920
What happiness?

165
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,160
Hey!

166
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,760
My happiness is sitting on a swing.
Hold on, hold on.

167
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,640
Here we are, helping each other.

168
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,000
We love each other, so we have to help each other.

169
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,400
Rock, paper, scissors?

170
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
P’ Yu, do you love me?

171
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,400
Ugh, enough.

172
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,680
Come on, let’s help out, so we can finish quickly.

173
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,000
You don't love me?

174
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,760
Now, what should I do?

175
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,600
What now?

176
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,680
I'm kidding,  let’s help out, so we can finish quickly.

177
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,400
P’ Yu.

178
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
Where are you going?

179
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,000
P’ Yu.

180
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,840
P’ Yu.

181
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,920
P’ Yu.

182
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,280
P’ Yu.

183
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,160
P’ Yu.

184
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,200
Can you hear me?

185
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,760
P’ Yu.

186
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,920
P’ Yu.

187
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,600
P’ Yu.

188
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,160
P’ Yu.

189
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,880
P’ Yu.

190
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,400
P’ Yu.

191
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,200
P’ Yu.

192
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,320
P’ Yu.

193
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,720
P’ Yu.

194
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,360
P’ Yu, watch out for the car!

195
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,280
Hey, Ai!

196
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,880
Ai, are you okay?

197
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,520
Ai!

198
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,200
Ai!

199
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,560
Are you okay?

200
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,560
Ai, are you okay?

201
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,480
It's okay.

202
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,080
Can you tell me what happened, Ai?

203
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,000
Last night, I ate so much, man,

204
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,200
why am I hungry again?

205
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,000
Ing, come talk to me for a sec.

206
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,320
Sure,

207
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,360
I’ll be right there.

208
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,200
Sure.

209
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,120
Okay, sure.

210
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Got it.

211
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,160
See you, Yo.

212
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,320
Where are you going?

213
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,160
Off to work.

214
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,800
Alright, got it.

215
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,800
What is it?

216
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,760
Come here.

217
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,800
I know you had a dream.

218
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,880
What was it about?

219
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,920
I dreamt that P’Yu got hit by a car.

220
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,440
Huh?

221
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,560
When?

222
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,920
Just now,

223
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,120
right in front of the house.

224
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,000
But this time the dream felt different.

225
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,640
How so?

226
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
In the dream, I couldn’t move.

227
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,320
Uh, when I was looking up stuff for you,

228
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,440
I think I came across something similar.

229
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,360
But the way people dream can be different.

230
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,880
Some might be aware,

231
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,000
others might not realize it,

232
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,880
or maybe you just saw that image and nothing more.

233
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,880
I get it.

234
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But in my dream, I really couldn’t move.

235
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,840
I was about to run and help P’Yu,

236
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,560
but it felt like something was holding me back.

237
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
Besides seeing P’Yu get hit by the car,

238
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,480
did you see anything else?

239
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,360
No, nothing.

240
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,120
After P’Yu got hit,

241
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,560
the dream just cut off.

242
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,800
But I saved him just now, in real life.

243
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,200
Then that’s good, right? No need to worry about it anymore.

244
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,440
Yeah, but Ing, you can’t tell P’Yu or Yo about this, okay?

245
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
I know.

246
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,640
Calm down.

247
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,080
Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.

248
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,120
Yo!

249
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,480
Huh? This is like a movie I saw once.

250
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,840
Yeah, it goes like this.

251
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,800
So you’re saying,

252
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,160
you had a dream and it came true,

253
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,400
and you dreamt that P’Yu was in danger,

254
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,120
but why didn’t you tell me?

255
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,480
How could I tell you?

256
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,360
That’s your brother, man.

257
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,560
If I told you, you’d just worry.

258
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,480
Exactly because he’s my brother, you should’ve told me!

259
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Yo, stop overreacting, okay?

260
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,400
You too, not telling me anything.

261
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,640
Do you want to get some too?

262
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
So now that you know,

263
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,360
what are you going to do about it?

264
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,280
Yo, don’t tell P’Yu, okay?

265
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,520
Please.

266
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
But if P’Yu’s in danger, shouldn’t we warn him?

267
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,640
That’s exactly why I didn’t tell you.

268
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
If I did, you’d just worry more about P’Yu.

269
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,760
It’s not like I wanted to keep it from you,

270
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,480
I just didn’t want to make it a big deal.

271
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,600
Okay.

272
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,120
Fine.

273
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,520
But...

274
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
if you have another dream about P’Yu being in danger,

275
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,280
you have to tell me everything.

276
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,400
Ok.

277
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,760
I’m serious, Ai.

278
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,360
You have to let me know, I want to help protect P’Yu too.

279
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,960
I don’t want anything to happen to my brother like...

280
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,400
I get it.

281
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,160
So, where is P’Yu?

282
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,280
Where did he go?

283
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
I saw him on the phone outside.

284
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,440
Oh, Ai,

285
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,280
what are you doing sitting here all alone?

286
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,880
Where did you go?

287
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,160
I went to work, like usual.

288
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,440
Really?

289
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,040
Don’t even start, P’Yu, going places without telling me.

290
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,920
I went to work, just like I always do.

291
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,440
But today’s different.

292
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,840
Different how, Ai?

293
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,480
Are you okay?

294
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,120
Alright, alright.

295
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,080
I’m sorry.

296
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,160
From now on, I’ll tell you everywhere I go,

297
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,520
every single step I take.

298
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,200
I’m going to the left now, okay?

299
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,480
I’m heading to the right now.

300
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,280
About to hug my boyfriend now.

301
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,040
Why are you pouting so much, huh?

302
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,600
I’m sorry.

303
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,840
I’m really sorry.

304
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
I sleep in Ai's room tonight.

305
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,760
(Since we’ve been dating, you’ve completely forgotten about your own home and your brother, huh?)

306
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,440
Well, I didn’t say anything when
you’ve been hanging out with Ing all the time.

307
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,680
This time, Ai seems a bit off,

308
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,360
so I’ll stay with him.

309
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,560
(Alright, just keep an eye on him.)

310
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,480
Bye.

311
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,440
P’ Yu!

312
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,120
P’ Yu!

313
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Can you hear me?

314
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,560
P’ Yu!
