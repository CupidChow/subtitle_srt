00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,600
This series is purely a work of fiction

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,000
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,800
But this time the dream felt different.

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,760
How so?

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,280
I was about to run and help P’ Yu,

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,120
but it felt like something was holding me back.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,320
But if P’Yu’s in danger, shouldn’t we warn him?

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,600
If I did, you’d just worry more about P’ Yu.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,040
Maybe you need to sleep longer or deeper,

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,000
so you can see more details in your dream.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,440
To help P' Yu.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,800
P’ Yu, don’t let anything happen to you,

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,120
I’ll help you.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,880
P’ Yu.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,720
P’ Yu.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,280
Let’s just let fate run its course,

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,920
whether it’s my fate,

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,160
or both of ours, screw it.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,160
Grandma.

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,480
What's up, dear?

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,400
Can I help you with the cooking, Grandma?

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,560
Of course!

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,040
Then how about you go pick the ivy gourd leaves
in front of the house for me, okay?

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,080
Sure, I’ll go get them all for you!

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,200
Sure, go.

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,560
Don't go in!

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,480
Don't go in!

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,720
Grandpa!

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Mom, are you telling me that
great-grandpa had the same dream as me?

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,280
Yes,

31
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,720
and so did I.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,960
Wait, Mom, this story sounds like something
I've heard this before.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,120
Oh,

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,360
I heard it on the radio.

35
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,880
Yeah,

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,600
that was me.

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,200
Um, Ai,

38
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,360
do you remember when you were locked up as a child?

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,800
Back then, I dreamed too, I knew where you were.

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,680
I didn’t know what to do,

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,080
so I called them for help.

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,880
Then...

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,360
you must understand me well, right?

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,200
So...

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,000
what did you see?

46
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,760
I saw...

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,720
P' Yu dying.

48
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,040
So,

49
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,160
Uh, what else did you see?

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,800
In the first dream,

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,400
I saw P' Yu lying on the bed covered in blood.

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
In the second dream, I—

53
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,600
I picked up P' Yu's phone and saw—

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,240
It was the 25th.

55
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,840
And what else did you see?

56
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,000
I don’t know, Mom.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,520
I’ve tried,

58
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,840
but I don’t know what to do.

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,280
I really want to help P' Yu,

60
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,520
but I know I'll get hurt instead of him.

61
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,320
I’m willing to.

62
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
What happened, Mom?

63
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,640
P' Yu!

64
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,760
P' Yu!

65
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,520
P' Yu!

66
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,440
Mom!

67
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,520
Do you think I haven’t seen this vision?

68
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,160
Let me help P' Yu, Mom.

69
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,400
Today,

70
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,040
P' Yu is going to die.

71
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
I know it's not an accident.

72
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
Someone's trying to kill P' Yu for real!

73
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
(Who's going to kill P' Yu?)

74
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,840
Uh,

75
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,120
nothing, Dad.

76
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,640
Don’t hide it from me,

77
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
both of you.

78
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
Who's going to kill P' Yu?

79
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,320
P' Ice.

80
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,200
Then should we report it to the police?

81
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,640
And who would believe us, Dad?

82
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,640
Tell them we saw the future in a dream?

83
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,240
Hello, Ing.

84
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,880
P' Ice is the one responsible.

85
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
What.. what did he do?

86
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,640
Calm down, Ai. Take a breath first.

87
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,680
It's like this, in my dream...

88
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,960
P' Ice is the one who did it.

89
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,600
Huh?

90
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,960
Uh,

91
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,000
I’ll explain later,

92
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,000
but are you with P' Yu now?

93
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,480
Yes, and Yo is here too.

94
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,320
Then...

95
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,920
hurry and find P' Ice,

96
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,720
and leave someone to watch over P' Yu.

97
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,920
I’m on my way.

98
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Uh, okay.

99
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,880
Dad, hurry!

100
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,480
Yes, dear.

101
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,400
What did Ai say?

102
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,760
He told me to find P' Ice.

103
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,760
Huh?

104
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,080
I don’t know either.

105
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,240
He’ll explain later, but he’s rushing here.

106
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,120
Then you stay here.

107
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,320
I’ll go find that bastard Ice myself.

108
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,480
Hey,

109
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,800
be careful, okay?

110
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,680
Uh, alright.

111
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,240
That's great.

112
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,600
Smile for the camera, please.

113
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,320
Okay.

114
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,080
Good.

115
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,480
Okay.

116
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,000
Come on.

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,760
I think we got it.

118
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,880
Okay, next up, we’ll pair up.

119
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,200
It's good.

120
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,000
Great.

121
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Can someone touch up the makeup, please?

122
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,040
We’ll pair up for the next shot.

123
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Next pair,  please.

124
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,040
Oh, Fix, can you grab my phone for me?

125
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,800
It’s in my bag.

126
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,640
Sure.

127
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,440
Thanks.

128
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,000
Alright.

129
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,520
Ing, can you get P' Yu's phone?

130
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,560
Okay.

131
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,120
Thank you.

132
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Let's do these two.

133
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
P' Yu, excuse me.

134
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,080
Yes?

135
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,520
Your car is blocking another car.

136
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,720
Could you please move it?

137
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,800
Of course, of course.

138
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,560
I’ll be right back.

139
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,280
Okay.

140
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,360
Let's go.

141
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What? Where did he go?

142
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,960
Quickly, Dad.

143
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,040
It's here.

144
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,200
That's P' Yu's cars!

145
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,680
Oh, ok.

146
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,480
Yeah, I think so.

147
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,040
Hey, where's P' Yu?

148
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,120
I don’t know. He was just here a moment ago.

149
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,360
(Mother Aoi)

150
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,160
Ing, I told you to keep an eye on P' Yu!

151
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,920
Why didn’t you watch him?

152
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,360
I did!

153
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,120
I just went to grab his phone for a second,

154
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,920
and he disappeared.

155
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,320
Alright, let's help each other find P' Yu.

156
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,320
Let’s split up and search for him.

157
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,240
I'm going to go with Dad.

158
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,440
Okay.

159
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,680
I’ll check the other way then.

160
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,600
Uh!

161
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,760
Um.

162
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,360
Honey,

163
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,400
check the men’s restroom.

164
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,520
I’ll look over here.
Okay.

165
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,880
Dad?

166
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,480
Did you find him?

167
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,840
No, nothing.

168
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,040
Didn't you find him?

169
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,120
Where are you?

170
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,960
All done.

171
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,200
Thank you.

172
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,960
Thanks.

173
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
Hey.

174
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,840
Yes?

175
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,600
What are you doing on set?

176
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,800
Sorry.

177
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
(Found P' Ice, he’s in the studio.)

178
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,040
Ai says he found him, he's in the studio.

179
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,120
Over here, Mom!
Let’s go!

180
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
(Found P' Ice, he’s in the studio.)

181
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
(Found P' Ice, he’s in the studio.)

182
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,400
Come on.

183
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,320
P' Yu?

184
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,680
Let's go.

185
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,040
Alright, same as before,

186
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,760
stay close and work with the fabric. Ready?

187
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,440
Three, two, one—

188
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,280
P' Ice!

189
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,400
Who the hell are you?

190
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,000
P' Ice,

191
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,240
I know what you're about to do.

192
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,200
Please stop.

193
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,480
This isn’t your business, is it?

194
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,400
Don’t come any closer!

195
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,240
Do you want some?

196
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,080
Huh?

197
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,480
You want it that bad, huh?

198
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,000
Ai!

199
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,240
Ai!
Hold on!

200
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,440
Hold on! Hold on!

201
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,040
Take this.

202
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,360
Someone help, please!

203
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,920
Please help!

204
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,880
Hey, quiet down!

205
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,400
P' Ice, no!

206
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,720
All of you,

207
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,280
stay quiet,

208
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,760
or your kid is going to get stabbed!

209
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,040
Ai, be careful!

210
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,640
Where are you looking?
Mom! Dad!

211
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,040
What are you screaming for? You don't need to.

212
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,880
Scared now, huh?

213
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,240
You're getting it.

214
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,040
Don't!

215
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,560
Ai!

216
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,640
Hold on tight, son.

217
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,920
Hold on, hold on!

218
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,080
Ai, watch out!

219
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,880
Ai, be careful!

220
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,800
Hold on tight, son.

221
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,840
Ice, calm down!

222
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,680
P' Ice!

223
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,200
P' Ice, stop!

224
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,560
Don't do this!

225
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,600
Don't do it!

226
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,240
No!

227
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,320
Let go!

228
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,040
P' Ice!

229
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,800
I told you to let go!

230
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,800
Ai!

231
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Ai, hold on!

232
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,480
Hey!

233
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,040
Someone get him!

234
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,200
Hey!

235
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,080
Hey, let go of me!

236
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,400
Let's go of me!

237
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,160
Let's go of me!

238
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,040
Ai.

239
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,680
Ai, are you ok?

240
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,400
I'm ok mom.

241
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,360
You don't have to be afraid.

242
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,920
(Another big story, folks!)

243
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,840
(Remember?)

244
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,800
That famous actor, Ice

245
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,040
Well, let’s call him that for now.

246
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,240
After he caused a major incident,

247
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,200
and vanished,

248
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,840
he’s at it again!

249
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,480
But this time, he didn’t get away.

250
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,160
After trying to hurt the cameraman,

251
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,200
he got arrested and is now behind bars.

252
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,440
Ai.

253
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,280
Hmm?

254
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,880
Why didn’t you fight him from the start?

255
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,680
You dropped right onto us!

256
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,480
How was I supposed to fight him, Yo?

257
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh!

258
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,680
Alright, enough!

259
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,120
Stop fighting, this is a hospital.

260
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,720
Yeah,

261
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,680
good thing none of you are seriously hurt.

262
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,000
So, does this mean we saved P' Yu?

263
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,120
Since we all made it out safely,

264
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,400
I’d say so.

265
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,200
I’m sorry, everyone,

266
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,840
It’s not your fault.

267
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,680
Of course, how could we not help?

268
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,080
We’re all in this together.

269
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,240
Dad,

270
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,960
how did you know that Mom dreamed
about the future?

271
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
I've been sleeping beside your mom
for how many years?

272
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,560
I was sure of it when,

273
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,840
she found you in the storage room,

274
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,200
when you were little.

275
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
It was like she just knew you were there.

276
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,040
Give me your hand.

277
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,720
I’ll draw some strength for you.

278
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,440
Hold it tight, okay?

279
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,200
Ah, alright.

280
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,400
It’ll give you strength.

281
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,960
You’re not just trying to hurt my hand, are you?

282
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,040
It doesn’t seem to hurt much.

283
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Shall we have some watermelon?

284
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,320
Grapes must be getting boring by now.

285
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,400
Oh, after over 20 years of eating them,

286
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
now you realize we need a change?

287
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,480
Ai, isn't that too harsh?

288
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,960
Oh, my child’s got quite the tounge, huh?

289
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,920
P' Yu, help me! Mom’s going to hit me!

290
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,840
Oh!

291
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,200
Since he got a boyfriend, he's been acting so petite.

292
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,360
Annoying!

293
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,640
I’ll really hit you!

294
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,840
No, please don’t, Mom.

295
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,240
I’m protective of him.

296
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,680
Fine, if you two love each other so much,
just stay here then!

297
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,600
Just kidding.

298
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,920
Stay, don’t go anywhere yet.

299
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,920
Ai, I was going to ask you.

300
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
When did your dreams start?

301
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,880
My first one was when I fell from
the Christmas tree last year.

302
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
Oh, so that was your first dream?

303
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,120
Yes.

304
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,440
You started dreaming at twenty like me.

305
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,200
Actually, I have something I'm curious about.

306
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,960
Why, in my dream, is it always P’ Yu?

307
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,760
I don’t know either.

308
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
But when I dreamt,

309
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,280
I saw your dad and I saw you.

310
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,080
I think we only dream about the people we love.

311
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,800
So that means...

312
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,600
you loved me since then?

313
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,920
Who?

314
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,240
Who said I love you?

315
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,720
Are you getting too full of yourself?

316
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,720
Not listening, not listening.

317
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,640
I won’t hear it.

318
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Fine, love each other all you want!

319
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,200
Not eating? not eating for real?

320
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,480
Oh, go ahead, eat it all, dear.

321
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Here, come, I’ll feed you.

322
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,520
Here you go.

323
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,720
What you just said to your mom.

324
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,920
That means that you've loved me since then?

325
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,240
Probably.

326
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,800
So sweet-talking.

327
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Uh, are you still dreaming?

328
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,440
Yeah,

329
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,680
but just ordinary dreams now.

330
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,000
That’s good, then.

331
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
I’ve got something for you, Ai.

332
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,600
What is it?

333
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,720
Get it first.

334
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
Can you reach it?

335
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,760
Of course.

336
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
A pillow?

337
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,880
Woah.

338
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,080
Yep.

339
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,120
This pillow helps with health and skin care too.

340
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,520
You’ll sleep comfortably every night.

341
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,160
And here’s this.

342
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,680
Hmm?

343
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,320
This?

344
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,640
Hmm.

345
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,760
So you can dream about me every night,
even when I have late shoots.

346
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,320
even when I have late shoots.

347
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,040
Okay, ah.

348
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,160
It goes in here, right?

349
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,920
Yes.

350
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,720
Come on, let’s put it in.

351
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Let’s work together.

352
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Let me unwrap it for a sec.

353
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Where does this go?

354
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
So soft!

355
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Got it.

356
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,680
Is it ok?

357
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,360
Hold on tight.

358
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,720
Stop laughing.

359
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,800
Don’t forget to zip it.

360
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,120
Come on.

361
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,360
Here, here.

362
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,880
I get to stroke your head,

363
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,360
Ai.

364
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,440
You know, Ai,

365
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,920
even though I don’t have special powers like you,

366
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,880
where I can dream and see the future...

367
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,880
I can predict the future.

368
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,480
How’s that?

369
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,240
Well, my future...

370
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,160
will only have you in it, forever.

371
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,120
So cheesy.

372
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,000
But...

373
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,080
It’s the same for me, too.

374
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,560
P’ Yu.

375
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,280
I think next time is better, right?

376
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,320
How long will that take?

377
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,840
I don’t know, just wait.

378
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
But it’s really soft, isn’t it?

379
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,160
Mm-hmm.

380
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,880
Come here, let’s hug together.

381
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
It’s full now, feel free to walk around
and take a look.

382
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Congrats, Yu!

383
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
Thank you.

384
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,960
Congratulations!

385
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,800
Thank you.

386
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,280
The picture is beautiful.

387
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,880
Right?

388
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,200
Feel free to look around at your leisure.

389
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,720
Excuse me, I’ll go take a look.

390
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,320
Please do.

391
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,000
Please do.

392
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,360
Congrats, Yu!

393
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,160
Thank you.

394
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,040
Hello, Mother Aoi, and Father Mhok.

395
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,880
Hi.

396
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,160
I’m so proud of you, Yu.

397
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,960
Thank you.

398
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,800
Congrats, big brother.

399
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,360
Thanks, little brother.
I’m so happy for you.

400
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,280
Congratulations, P’ Yu!

401
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,080
The picture is beautiful.

402
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,000
Really talented.

403
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,720
Let’s take a picture.

404
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,320
Come, come.

405
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,440
Come, come. Perfect timing.

406
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,720
Mom.

407
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,240
Yes?

408
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,200
Mom, you should hold the camera.

409
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,080
Why?

410
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,120
Dad has a big face.

411
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,920
Oh no.

412
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,600
No, my face will look big too.

413
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
You'll get to be at the front.

414
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,760
Dad’s the one who should sacrifice himself.

415
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,840
I’ll take the photo.

416
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,600
Dad, come here.

417
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,360
Thank you, dear.

418
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,160
Of course,

419
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,320
let me get the spot ready.

420
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,520
Come stand in the middle.

421
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,040
Everyone can be seen, right?

422
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,120
Yes, perfect.

423
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,520
One, two, three.

424
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
Okay, one more shot.

425
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,320
One, two, three.

426
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,080
Okay, one more sweet smile, just in case.

427
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
One, two, three.

428
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
All done.

429
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,240
Okay, thanks a lot.

430
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,120
No problem.

431
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,720
Thank you, mom.

432
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Feel free to look around at your leisure.

433
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,160
There are lots more pictures inside.

434
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,760
Alright, see you later.

435
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,480
Got it.

436
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,920
This picture, I want to see this one.

437
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
This one?

438
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,760
Congrats, Yu.

439
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,680
Hey, how did you get here?

440
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,560
I just finished shooting a project.

441
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,000
It was nearby,

442
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,040
so I came to congratulate you.

443
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,960
Oh, P’ Pan, you’re back to working now?

444
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,320
Yeah, ever since Ice was caught.

445
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,000
He confessed the truth,

446
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,720
so I got to come back to work.

447
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,360
And are you okay?

448
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,400
I’m okay.

449
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,160
But the reason I’m here is that
I wanted to talk to Yu.

450
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,160
Oh,

451
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,440
suddenly I feel like a third wheel.

452
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,800
I'm just joking.

453
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,120
I know.

454
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,840
Okay, I’ll be over there then.

455
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,400
What is it, Pan?

456
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,960
I want to apologize to you.

457
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,560
Apologize for what?

458
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,040
Before, I said you were someone with no dreams.

459
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
But look at you now.

460
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,120
No need to apologize, Pan.

461
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,000
Honestly, at that time, I really didn’t have any dreams.

462
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,560
It’s actually a good thing you said that back then.

463
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,320
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have accomplished all of this.

464
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,680
One day, I’ll make my dreams come true too.

465
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,320
Just you watch.

466
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,360
Of course.

467
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,560
I believe in you, Pan.

468
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,280
It's going to come true.

469
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,320
Wanna go check out the pictures?

470
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,280
Sure, let’s go.
