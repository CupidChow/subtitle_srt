1
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:49,966
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

2
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,011
Airuju, the beginning
and the end of everything in the world.

3
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,345
Please accept Mubaek.

4
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,514
Let Mubaek rest in peace.

5
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,225
He disappeared.
Inaishingi disappeared.

6
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:03,605
So they were swapped.
Inaishingi and the general of Arthdal

7
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,190
are benetbeot.

8
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,194
They're Ragaz... and Asa Hon's children.

9
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,987
-   Geumha.
It was the Shahati.

10
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,364
Mubaek was killed by the Shahati.

11
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,532
And Queen Taealha is the one

12
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,825
controlling the Shahati now.

13
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,829
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

14
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,375
Lord Saya.

15
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,295
Lord Saya!

16
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,298
I'll tell King Tagon

17
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,300
and Tanya Niruha that you woke up.

18
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,557
The world is fun.

19
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,227
It must be some kind of an illness.

20
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,536
I think I saw
someone in the fire.

21
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,413
That might or might not have been
the Children of Shahati.

22
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,124
I will remember.

23
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,208
Certainly.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,961
I only have one question.

25
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,672
Just who are you

26
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,091
and why are you pretending to be Saya?

27
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,972
PURPLE BLOOD

28
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,729
Just who are you

29
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,357
and why are you pretending to be Saya?

30
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,202
You dare to smile?

31
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,454
That is not what's important for you,
is it?

32
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,457
I said I would make sure to recall it.

33
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,503
Your life depends on my words.

34
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,465
But how did you know?

35
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,342
Nobody else noticed.

36
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,219
You swung your sword

37
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,638
too fast for you to be Saya.

38
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,477
I see.

39
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,150
Here's a question.

40
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,568
Who are you?

41
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,945
I don't know.

42
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,823
They said I was Saya's benetbeot.

43
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,118
Saya had a benetbeot
that I didn't know of?

44
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,912
You weren't the only one.

45
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,622
I didn't know either.

46
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,998
I don't think that Saya guy

47
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,000
knew either.

48
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,920
I don't know the story behind us.

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,381
I don't even know
who my mother and father are.

50
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,550
Someone called Mubaek came

51
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,344
and said he would take me to my benetbeot.

52
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,471
So I followed him. That was it.

53
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,849
Where is Saya?

54
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,851
The place I was supposed to meet him

55
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,229
caught on fire, and someone attacked us.

56
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,563
Right.

57
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,190
It was the Shahati, of course.

58
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,609
WHITE MOUNTAIN TRIBE'S
ASSASSINATION ORGANIZATION

59
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,237
I lost consciousness,
and when I woke up,

60
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,988
I was here.

61
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,616
Saya? I don't know.

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,243
Maybe he died.

63
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,162
Why are you doing this?

64
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,373
Goodness.

65
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,669
There's no reason to it.
I was here when I woke up.

66
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,923
Everyone treated me like a general
calling me Saya,

67
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,049
so I was going

68
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,260
to pretend to be Saya

69
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,971
before running away.

70
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,349
So...

71
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,519
what do you do and where do you live?

72
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,603
Ah...

73
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,398
Is that what you want to know?

74
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,109
Is what I do important now?

75
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,154
What's important to you is that

76
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,532
I am not Saya.

77
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,914
As soon as I woke up,
people came running to me

78
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,458
and asked
if Taealha sent the Shahati after me.

79
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,543
They were sure of it.

80
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,004
That's when I thought,

81
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:01,050
"The once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
has come to me."

82
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,013
What opportunity?

83
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,431
With one word of mine, you--

84
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,224
The same goes for you, I reckon.

85
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,858
I'm an ignorant man
who's never entered the palace before,

86
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,985
but I roughly know how it works.

87
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,903
This is about

88
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,072
who becomes the heir.

89
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,284
Queen Taealha.

90
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,578
Wasn't Saya troublesome to you?

91
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,165
But in front of you,

92
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,335
you have a Saya that will do everything
as you say.

93
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,378
Queen Taealha,

94
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,006
you should grab the opportunity

95
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,799
like me.

96
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,260
I'll do everything as you say.

97
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,471
Whoever I am,

98
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,806
you need me...

99
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,062
right now, don't you?

100
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,651
Of course, you should give me
something big in return.

101
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,446
Bronze weapons trading rights, for one.

102
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,786
Your family...

103
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,581
is very funny.

104
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,044
Find a man
who has the same face as Saya.

105
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,837
Is that what you're saying?

106
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:23,591
Start from the warehouse in Hanchoa
where Mubaek died.

107
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,718
If he died, bring his corpse at least.

108
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,554
Of course, no matter what happens,

109
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,433
- be discreet.
- I understand, Your Highness.

110
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,399
What do you mean by a man
who has the same face as Lord Saya?

111
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,443
Get someone to keep an eye on Saya.

112
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,405
I will.

113
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,640
Why did you do that?

114
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,435
We could have pretty much
cornered the queen.

115
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,396
With only the testimony
of the Shahati attacking me?

116
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,314
If you had testified that,

117
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,734
there would have been a next step,
and the step after that.

118
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,448
Does the queen hold something over you?

119
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,324
Something I'm unaware of?

120
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,872
Tell me why you testified as such
in the court meeting.

121
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,250
I don't trust what I cannot understand.

122
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,546
Because he lost the war.

123
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,799
Saya might be thinking he got eliminated
from the battle

124
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,384
of the heirs.

125
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,472
Because I lost the war.

126
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,058
Do you think you've been eliminated?

127
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,894
No. That is why I testified

128
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,022
that I would make sure
to recall my memory.

129
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,151
That is...

130
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,403
very much like you.

131
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,370
What do you want?

132
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,082
I will... think about it.

133
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,385
WAHAN TRIBE,
ARTHDAL'S ROYAL GUARD

134
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,095
What is it?

135
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,932
Minister Yeolson
and Scriber Dunji are waiting inside.

136
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,707
What brings you two here?

137
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,211
Lord Saya.

138
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,963
We risked our lives to come here.

139
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,138
I heard you saw Inaishingi's face.

140
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,979
WAHAN, TANYA'S FATHER

141
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:29,694
The Wahan Tribe has fooled the King,
me, and all of us...

142
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,572
for a very long time.

143
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,864
A while ago,

144
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,033
you fooled the King too.

145
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,036
Yes. He did not tell King
that he and Inaishingi

146
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,913
were benetbeot.

147
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,001
Was it because your position
as an heir might've been in danger?

148
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,504
So?

149
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:52,258
- I'm saying you can join us.
- What if you're his yeomari?

150
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,844
I'm sure
Inaishingi would've contacted you.

151
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,804
Yes. A while ago,

152
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,348
Eunseom sent two people
of the Ago Tribe secretly.

153
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,311
I'm sure he did.

154
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,813
What did you do?

155
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,233
I killed him.

156
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,320
One ran away, but I'm sure he died too.

157
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,454
Do you expect me to believe that?

158
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,540
Didn't you want to help him?

159
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,335
He's your friend that grew up with you.

160
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,503
- He's a Wahan too.
- Eunseom

161
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,632
was never a part of the Wahan Tribe.

162
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,718
Yes.

163
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,095
Eunseom was always a foreigner.

164
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,433
He ran around carelessly
and ruined everything.

165
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,979
Urumi, Sudol, and Bandi.

166
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,651
They all died for nothing.

167
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,780
He tried his best in his own way

168
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,324
to save them.

169
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,408
No.

170
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,410
Not at all.

171
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,829
He was an ominous guy in the first place.

172
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,625
We should've just killed him
in the Lonicera Flower Forest.

173
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,631
Lord Saya, we're on the same boat.

174
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,550
I'm sure it was Eunseom
who tried to kill you.

175
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,635
Am I wrong?

176
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,639
We must work together and kill Eunseom.
That's how we can survive.

177
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,495
Saya. Saya.

178
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,044
ISSRUV

179
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,587
Saya.

180
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,840
Are you awake now?

181
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,262
Nice to meet you.

182
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,895
I'm Nosunaho.

183
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,065
When you were a baby,

184
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,694
I looked after you together with Asa Hon,
your mother.

185
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,281
Nice to meet you.

186
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,410
Nice to meet you.

187
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,302
We must work together and kill Eunseom.
That's how we can survive.

188
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,390
We should've just killed him
in the Lonicera Flower Forest.

189
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,426
WAHAN, EUNSEOM'S OLD FRIEND

190
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,353
Dalsae.

191
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,951
He must be Eunseom...

192
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,911
He's Eunseom, right?

193
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,747
I'll kill you.

194
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,419
I'm not the old Mungtae
that used to tremble behind you.

195
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,682
I will kill you.

196
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,934
Yes.

197
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,435
You killed Teodae too.

198
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,272
Try killing me too!

199
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,108
Teodae's dead?

200
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,901
Yes.

201
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,571
He's dead, you bastard!

202
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,204
Kill me.

203
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,415
Kill me, you bastard.

204
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,418
Kill me!

205
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,171
Why did Teodae die?

206
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,508
Why?

207
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,845
Why did he die?

208
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,929
He stabbed himself...

209
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,601
on his neck...

210
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,730
even before we reached Doldambul.

211
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,232
It's all your fault.

212
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,401
If you hadn't betrayed us back then,

213
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,821
we could've saved both you and Teodae.

214
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,782
And Teodae would've survived.

215
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,620
If you didn't do
something so stupid back then...

216
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,084
How is that my fault?

217
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,754
You guys abandoned us first.

218
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,088
Teodae and me.

219
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,717
You guys abandoned us first.

220
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,594
Do you think I wasn't scared?

221
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,888
I was scared too.

222
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,016
I didn't abandon you.

223
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,394
I couldn't think straight
because I was scared too.

224
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,283
Leave.

225
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,120
Take Eunseom with you...

226
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,416
and leave Arthdal quietly. Please.

227
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,835
Don't make me kill...

228
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,006
any more friends.

229
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,765
Eunseom.

230
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,810
Eunseom.

231
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,397
Let's not kill him.

232
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,107
Please.

233
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,275
He's too weak.

234
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,238
He's still too weak. Okay?

235
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,617
Being weak cannot become an excuse.

236
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,913
You said

237
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:42,001
you would make a world
where being weak wouldn't be a crime.

238
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,463
You said you would make the world
different from Arthdal.

239
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,340
Who...

240
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,343
am I?

241
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,763
I asked, who am I?

242
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,309
You are Inaishingi.

243
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,394
I said

244
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,814
I would make a world
where being weak wouldn't be a crime,

245
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,608
not a world which forgives every crime.

246
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,111
- They're different.
- I know, Inaishingi.

247
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,195
It's just that...

248
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,198
Mungtae could have killed me.

249
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,783
I owe my life to him.

250
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,952
So please don't kill him.

251
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,328
Mungtae's life too!

252
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,082
Before I give it to you...

253
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,877
it isn't yours.

254
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,796
That is why...

255
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,549
I am begging you like this.

256
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,218
Inaishingi, please.

257
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,637
Please salvage Mungtae's life.

258
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,265
Please.

259
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,106
I'm giving Mungtae's life

260
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,567
to you.

261
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,653
Do whatever you want.

262
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,624
What are you saying?

263
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,834
You must make up with Queen Taealha.

264
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,255
As long as Saya gets back his memories,
we can corner the queen again.

265
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,258
- Why are you suddenly--
- Since Mubaek's troops lost,

266
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,595
you need to take part
in the next battle yourself.

267
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,764
What does that have to do with this?

268
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:23,268
When you go to war,
Queen Taealha will remain in Arthdal.

269
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,688
Can you really leave Arthdal
in her hands in this state?

270
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,275
I've been telling you this.

271
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,194
Until the prince grows up,

272
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,655
you must maintain
good relationship with Queen--

273
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,662
Your Majesty.
Prince Arok is not in the palace.

274
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,122
What do you mean he's not?

275
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,625
I think Queen Taealha took him away
before Lord Saya's testimony.

276
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,595
Queen Taealha,
you should grab the opportunity, like me.

277
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,597
Whoever I am...

278
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,727
you need me right now, don't you?

279
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,320
Where's Prince Arok?

280
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,907
It took you long enough to realize,
Your Majesty.

281
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,577
Do you know why I want
to separate you from Arok?

282
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,914
Because you can get rid
of me easily that way?

283
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,082
No.

284
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:31,211
Because you can kill your own son
for your survival and greed.

285
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,923
We promised to live like that.

286
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,676
We promised to live only for ourselves.

287
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,930
That's why you liked me more
and you wanted me more.

288
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,015
Yes.

289
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,058
I wanted you so much.

290
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,768
I trusted you so much

291
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,063
- and I was very grateful to you.
- As you should.

292
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,648
I made you a king.

293
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,610
But you get in the way
of me looking like a king,

294
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,696
when you clearly know
that's all there is to a king.

295
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,407
That's why you get on my nerves so much.

296
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,076
You're so annoying
and I want to kill you so much.

297
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,245
So?

298
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,165
Are you here to kill me?

299
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,794
Let's make up.

300
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,883
I want to want you,
trust you, and be grateful to you.

301
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,593
Like I did before.

302
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,061
There's only one way for us to make up.

303
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,107
Arok needs to be recognized
as the heir of you, Aramun.

304
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,864
What about Saya?

305
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,908
As for Saya,

306
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,701
I will deal with him.

307
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,621
Do you think I'm staying still
because I cannot kill him?

308
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,582
He knows the secret
that could destroy our dynasty.

309
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,834
The purple blood of Arok and I.

310
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,461
And you who mixed that blood.

311
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,673
- Tagon.
- What if something happens to him

312
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,926
and he spreads the secret
of the king being an Igutu?

313
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,970
What would happen then?

314
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,888
Killing him won't solve this.

315
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,432
I didn't say I would kill him.

316
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,559
Tagon.

317
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,228
Is that the only problem?

318
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,563
What other problem would there be?

319
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,944
What if I solve the issue related to Saya?

320
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,406
There's no solution to this.

321
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,367
No. There is.

322
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,791
Why did Saya testify in my favor?

323
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,547
Can you really make Saya
give up on becoming an heir?

324
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,049
I can.

325
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,468
When Arok succeeds you,

326
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,471
I'll make sure
Saya congratulates him sincerely.

327
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,558
Just what are you holding over him?

328
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,269
You can trust me, Tagon.

329
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,565
Then prepare the Wind and Flowers Ritual.

330
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,400
A RITUAL TO GRANT DIVINITY TO THE PRINCE

331
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,943
Arok, our child,

332
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,988
will become the heir of me, Aramun.

333
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,242
Did you say
the Wind and Flowers Ritual?

334
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,535
Yes.

335
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,995
King Tagon and Queen Taealha said

336
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,080
they would hold
the Wind and Flowers Ritual

337
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:16,209
and they were going to pray
to get the right date for the ritual.

338
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,795
Are they planning
to do an inheritance ceremony?

339
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,380
Gosh.

340
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,466
Does Lord Saya know about this too?

341
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,051
Does this make sense?

342
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,053
If that happens,
Lord Saya wouldn't stand still.

343
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,430
Royal Guard.

344
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,142
Why are you getting so riled up?

345
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,145
It's nothing.

346
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,397
Forgive me, Niruha.

347
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,154
It's the trading rights

348
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,366
for bronze weapons
to the south of Pyeongmire.

349
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,910
I cannot thank you enough.

350
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,583
What will you tell Tagon?

351
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,170
"I shall give up being an heir.

352
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,922
Ask Queen Taealha for the reason."

353
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,633
Do what you want after that.

354
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:11,056
He will probably guess
that you're holding something big over me.

355
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,185
- Don't go too far. He'll find out.
- Of course.

356
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,400
I'll leave for Pyeongmire today.

357
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,862
And I'll disappear
when the right opportunity comes.

358
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,448
Don't worry.

359
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,494
I'll try my best
so you won't make up your mind

360
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,579
to kill me secretly.

361
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:43,088
Black kite is flying, hide little chick

362
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,676
Hide under your mother's wings

363
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,386
We must hide quickly.

364
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,598
Prince, nobody will find you
if you hide there.

365
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,683
Really?

366
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,107
Did you send a message
to the Great Shrine?

367
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,316
Of course.

368
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,570
They're preparing to start praying
as soon as you three arrive.

369
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:12,367
But, Queen Taealha, is Prince Arok
finally becoming the heir?

370
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,704
- Yes.

371
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,414
Someone went to fetch Arok, right?

372
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,754
Where is Prince Arok?

373
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,381
I need to take him to the palace.

374
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,634
Yes. Prince Arok is playing
hide and seek there...

375
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,011
Where are you?

376
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,847
Prince Arok.

377
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,682
Prince Arok.

378
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,267
Where are you?

379
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,128
The prince...

380
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,172
has been abducted.

381
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,216
What?

382
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,986
The ritual cannot take place.

383
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,988
I abducted the prince.

384
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,866
May honor be with Niruha.

385
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,245
What do you mean? He's abducted?

386
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,622
Yeolbi took Prince Arok and disappeared.

387
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,376
If this is your plan...

388
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,627
I should be saying that.

389
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,255
Yeolbi is a servant from your Hae Tribe.

390
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,263
Now's not the time for this.

391
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,184
Priests.

392
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,940
Lock up the Great Shrine immediately.

393
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,277
No one can leave starting now.

394
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,989
Also, bring the priests
who are in charge of my robes here.

395
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,512
"White Peak Mountain's Hearts"?

396
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,598
A RELIGION THAT BELIEVES ARAMUN WAS IGUTU

397
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,560
Baekha Gyeokmulsa.

398
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,686
BAEKHA

399
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,521
- Yes.
- You share the room with Yeolbi, right?

400
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,897
Where is Yeolbi?

401
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,276
Queen Taealha has arrived.

402
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,281
I heard you were close with Yeolbi.

403
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,659
Yes, Your Highness.

404
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,120
Baekha.

405
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,956
I really hate doing this.

406
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,460
But I'm very riled up right now.

407
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,463
And I don't have much time.

408
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,383
I want you
to answer my questions immediately.

409
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,927
Yes, Your Highness.

410
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,181
But I'm very worried...

411
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,476
that you might answer me late,

412
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:30,899
say you do not know,
or say you cannot remember clearly.

413
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,407
Baekha.

414
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,576
Oh! Mother.

415
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,704
It's okay.

416
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,248
You just need to answer well.

417
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,085
- I will.
- If Baekha replies late,

418
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,754
- behead her immediately.
- Yes, Your Highness.

419
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,255
What?

420
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,718
Mother.

421
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,013
I will ask.

422
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,306
Yes.

423
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,641
Was there anything strange

424
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,143
about Yeolbi nowadays?

425
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,313
Who was it?

426
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,775
Who put this in my robe?

427
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,749
Sojin.

428
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,918
It was you.

429
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,058
You're here, Your Highness.

430
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,185
Who is Sojin, High Priest Niruha?

431
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,119
Your Highness.

432
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,205
Niruha was interrogating Sojin.

433
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,251
High Priest Niruha.

434
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,172
Did the prince really get abducted?

435
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,633
As soon as you found out he was abducted,

436
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,386
you were interrogating Sojin?

437
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,848
You must've known something, Niruha.

438
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,683
Your Highness,

439
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,227
Sojin is
a White Peak Mountain's Hearts believer--

440
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,896
White Peak Mountain's Hearts!

441
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,148
They claim that Aramun was Igutu,

442
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,067
so they must've been unhappy
with Prince Arok becoming the heir.

443
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:39,944
And they...

444
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,114
follow your orders, Niruha.

445
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,741
So?

446
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,494
If you are innocent,

447
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,246
I'll have a look around the Great Shrine.

448
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,291
Will you allow me?

449
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,585
Go ahead.

450
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,838
Surround the Great Shrine
and search thoroughly.

451
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,423
Yes, Your Highness.

452
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,094
I did it.

453
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,517
Let's go back.

454
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,064
Incredible.

455
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,733
With this, we get to own bronze weapons,

456
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:22,403
and even if that general comes back,
his position as an heir will be gone.

457
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,782
No. I'm thinking about something else
for Saya.

458
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,409
What are you thinking about?

459
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,577
What are you planning?

460
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,373
He's my brother.

461
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,125
And...

462
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,754
I'll leave this to Syoreujagin.

463
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:41,965
Can we trust him?

464
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,510
We're the only ones that can buy
that many bronze weapons anyway.

465
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,054
As long as we pay him well
and he makes a profit,

466
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,723
he will never betray us.

467
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,851
That's true.

468
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,686
Let's go now.

469
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,146
Susu, what should I do?

470
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,693
- What is it?
- The prince has been abducted.

471
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,237
The soldiers are surrounding
the Great Shrine,

472
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,322
and I can't find out anything about Tanya.

473
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,284
The prince? How is that related
to the Great Shrine?

474
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,910
I don't know,

475
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,037
but people are saying
Niruha is being suspected.

476
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,251
We must not get involved in anything.
We must leave.

477
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,004
Nobody knows
whether Inaishingi is alive or dead.

478
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,881
If something happens to you...

479
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,970
Go back first and let them know
that Inaishingi will come back soon.

480
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,264
- What about you?
- Don't worry.

481
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,516
We'll be right after you.

482
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,734
Search thoroughly.

483
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,985
Yes, sir.

484
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,741
What's happening?

485
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,748
Are they related?

486
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,207
Pardon?

487
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,334
Are they related?

488
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,170
This abduction
and the White Peak Mountain's Hearts.

489
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,339
- Niruha.
- Is it because

490
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,300
I didn't acknowledge your doctrine
which claimed

491
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,428
Aramun was Igutu, and was going to do
an inheritance ceremony

492
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,930
for someone who wasn't Igutu?

493
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,014
No, Niruha.

494
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,309
Then just why did Sojin and Yeolbi
of the Fortress of Fire

495
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,685
get involved in this?

496
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,903
We White Peak Mountain's Hearts
were persecuted for years,

497
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,073
but we have never done
something like this.

498
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:35,286
Then is this not related to anyone
of White Peak Mountain's Hearts?

499
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,871
Ever since your accession,

500
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,791
White Peak Mountain's Hearts
have grown a lot in size.

501
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,671
But you still don't acknowledge
our doctrines.

502
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,257
So someone
might have been unhappy with that.

503
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,593
Is that what you're saying?

504
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,805
Maybe... that's the case.

505
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,891
- Niruha.

506
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,185
Why won't you say anything
about our doctrines?

507
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:02,981
Aramun was Igutu and was murdered
by the Asa Clan's collateral line.

508
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,232
This is the truth.

509
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,317
Everyone wants to know.

510
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,695
Just why--

511
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,154
Now is not the time for this.

512
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,701
Forgive me, Niruha.

513
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:19,288
Is there anyone suspicious
among White Peak Mountain's Hearts?

514
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:21,874
Niruha.

515
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:26,004
Who led White Peak Mountain's Hearts
on the Day of Star Bell?

516
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:30,717
Who will benefit the most
if something bad happens to the prince?

517
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,052
It's not Saya.

518
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,220
It's not Saya.

519
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,390
Queen, he's the most suspicious one.

520
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,183
It cannot be Saya.

521
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,060
Your Highness.

522
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,606
Look at this.
I found this in Sojin's room.

523
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,872
"I finished my work.

524
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,166
May honor be
with High Priest Tanya Niruha."

525
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,293
I wonder what this is.

526
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,547
I hear that dozens of times every day,
Your Highness.

527
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,218
Did you get impatient?

528
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:15,887
Let me out.

529
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,306
I will find Prince Arok.

530
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,392
You hid him, didn't you?

531
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,478
If not, how can you find him?

532
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,022
With my psychic ability of the gods.

533
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,400
Psychic ability of the gods?

534
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,029
You want me to believe that?

535
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,739
Should I make you?

536
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,033
Don't try anything funny.

537
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,618
Where is my son?

538
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,917
Get me out of here.

539
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,628
Get me out of here.

540
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,135
I'll find your son for you.

541
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,263
Now, what are you going to do?

542
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,000
Why is she here? What happened?

543
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,044
What's happening? I'm scared.

544
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,591
Niruha.

545
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,554
Niruha.

546
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,807
There.

547
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,434
Catch that priest.

548
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,769
- Pardon?
- Hurry up.

549
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,607
What's wrong?

550
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,485
What's wrong?

551
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,779
What?

552
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,947
Gosh.

553
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,031
Niruha.

554
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,037
Niruha.

555
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,957
What did you say in your mind?

556
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,001
What did Mubaek do?

557
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,045
Niruha.

558
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,048
May honor be with you, Niruha.

559
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,259
Did you read all of my thoughts?

560
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,969
Tell me clearly.

561
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,220
What is that about?

562
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,474
I will tell you everything.

563
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,102
Will you follow me?

564
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,231
White Peak Mountain's Hearts have
something to do with this.

565
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,401
The queen found it out?

566
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,863
Royal Guard Head,
capture White Peak Mountain's Hearts--

567
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,947
Your Majesty.

568
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,328
Exiled Asa Sakan wishes to see you.

569
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,537
Minister.

570
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,372
Are you insane?

571
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,749
Can't you read the room?

572
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,500
Do you think King has time for it?

573
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,338
She said he knew where the prince was.

574
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,380
This is a training ground of priests
that was closed down long time ago.

575
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,341
That's what it's known as, but it isn't.

576
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,719
Tanya.

577
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,764
What happened?

578
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,350
I heard you were locked up
in the Great Shrine.

579
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,894
I told her I would find the prince
and came out.

580
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,813
But he...

581
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,984
Who are you? Did you summon me here?

582
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,819
Yes, that was me.

583
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,698
Then the note in my sleeve...

584
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,116
Yes, of course.

585
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,660
We sent them.

586
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,121
We have the prince too.

587
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,638
Did you say you knew
where my son was, Asa Sakan?

588
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,223
HEAD OF COLLATERAL LINE OF THE ASA CLAN

589
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,225
Where's the prince?

590
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,518
What were you thinking...

591
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,645
Lord Saya, what were you thinking...

592
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,649
when you gave such a testimony?

593
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,194
"Attack Taealha first and isolate Tagon."

594
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,488
That was the plan.

595
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,326
Sword, Bell, and Mirror.

596
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,785
Why are you acting

597
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,413
as if you've forgotten the mission?

598
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,458
How do you know about that?

599
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,294
Did you change your mind
after Mubaek passed away?

600
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,797
Now that Mubaek is dead,
does the mission seem trifling?

601
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,967
Niruha.

602
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,385
You are a god.

603
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,971
I cannot fully comprehend a god's will,

604
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,724
but Tagon's son must not inherit Aramun.

605
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,142
I understand.

606
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,436
Where's the prince?

607
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,566
Before that,
there's something you two must know.

608
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,984
Follow me.

609
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,039
This is where Aramun is asleep.

610
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,000
What did you say?

611
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,795
What kind of nonsense is that...

612
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,261
A while ago, Mubaek discovered this place.

613
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:52,098
Aramun ascended to heaven.
Why is his tomb here?

614
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,891
Because he didn't ascend to heaven.

615
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:58,062
Aramun was murdered
by the collateral line of the Asa Clan,

616
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:02,525
and they even locked away the coffin
because they were afraid of that murder.

617
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,863
Our ancestors killed Aramun.

618
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,076
What does that have to do with this?

619
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,830
- Where's Arok?
- They're related, Tagon.

620
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,541
If you don't listen to me until the end,

621
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,585
you'll be holding your son's dead body
in your arms.

622
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,130
Fine.

623
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,717
You're saying what White Peak
Mountain's Hearts claimed was true. So?

624
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,053
The oraha of your Saenyeok Tribe
was in on it too.

625
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,138
A TRIBAL CHIEF

626
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,724
We were going
to acknowledge Aramun at first.

627
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,519
He was outstanding and wise,

628
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,398
but he founded a god called Airuju

629
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:47,445
and tried to bring Neanthals into Arthdal
saying it was God's will.

630
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:51,490
Do you think
we could possibly have kept him alive?

631
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,580
Aramun Haesulla is asleep here.

632
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,042
Neither Mubaek nor I can open it.

633
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,211
Only the missionaries of the prophecy can.

634
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,006
Sword, Bell, and Mirror.

635
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,092
Therefore, the two of you must open it.

636
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,345
Please accept the mission.

637
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,814
What are Sword, Bell, and Mirror?

638
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:26,942
And what's the mission?

639
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,611
Eunseom, you are the Sword.

640
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,156
I am the Bell and Saya is the Mirror.

641
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,242
This was what I meant
by something you must know of.

642
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,496
Explain so I can understand.
What does that mean?

643
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,748
It's an old prophecy of Arthdal.

644
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,001
It says Sword, Bell, and Mirror
will end the world.

645
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,130
And it is also the mission Asa Sin,
the Great White Wolf...

646
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,882
...gave to us.

647
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,760
Mubaek wanted to join us.

648
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,435
Whether it's Arthdal or Wahan,
the prophecy doesn't matter to me now.

649
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,187
No. It does.

650
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,191
Starting from how your mother
brought you to the Wahan Tribe.

651
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,151
Everything matters.

652
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,721
As our ancestors stabbed
and slashed Aramun,

653
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,682
they trembled in fear.

654
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,809
Goodness.

655
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:27,521
The purple blood
that flowed from Aramun's body.

656
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,356
He was Igutu.

657
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,611
One thing is clear now.

658
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,746
Aramun...

659
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,373
was Igutu.

660
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,836
Whether Aramun was Igutu or not,
whether our ancestors killed him or not,

661
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,130
why must I be listening to that story?

662
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,883
Another thing has become clear.

663
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,134
Here.

664
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:06,894
Our mission started from Asa Sin,
the Great White Wolf.

665
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:13,025
And here, Sword, Bell, and Mirror
were passed down from Aramun.

666
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,323
Sword, Bell, and Mirror.

667
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,992
One day,
in the year of singing wolf...

668
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:25,371
...Sword, Bell, and Mirror appeared
in the world together.

669
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,462
I...

670
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,506
am Aramun?

671
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,675
Yes, you're Aramun.

672
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,802
That was what your mother said.

673
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,513
Once the scab falls off,

674
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:47,685
go back to this place, Aramun.

675
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,019
EUNSEOM AND SAYA'S MOTHER

676
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:52,106
Mother wasn't sane at that time.

677
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,273
What about Helper?

678
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,526
You know Helper's abilities.

679
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,362
Helper is Kanmoreu, Aramun's horse.

680
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,447
It's the same as the legend.

681
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,329
Fine, let's say that's true.

682
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,081
What about it?

683
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,126
I'm Inaishingi now.

684
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,169
I cannot be Aramun.

685
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:17,256
I'm the reincarnation of Inaishingi
who has been Aramun's enemy

686
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,591
since 200 years ago.

687
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:23,721
You came all the way to Iark
following an unknown destiny...

688
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,598
...and grew up being taught
by the Great White Wolf.

689
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,392
We can make the world--

690
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,560
The world.

691
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,894
What about the world?

692
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,272
- What we learned?
- Eunseom.

693
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:37,484
When Mungtae betrayed us,
when Teodae killed himself,

694
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:42,573
and when Father Yeolson
killed Yakdu whom I sent...

695
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,828
I cursed the Great White Wolf
and abandoned her teachings.

696
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,748
Yes, you're right.

697
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,041
People's minds

698
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,004
are full of clamor
of their ugly greed and desires.

699
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,340
The same goes for the Wahan Tribe
who were taught by her.

700
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,800
No, they're worse.

701
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:06,013
Asa Sin, the Great White Wolf...

702
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,974
- failed.
- No.

703
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,935
She didn't fail
because of greed and desires.

704
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,437
When you flip them,

705
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,273
they become fervent wishes and hopes.

706
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,154
When I was in Gitbadak...

707
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,406
...when I first went to Agoha...

708
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,491
AGO'S HOME[

709
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,619
...all they wanted was to hurt each other.

710
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,871
There were only betrayals and doubt.

711
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,041
But do you know
why they appointed me as Inaishingi?

712
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,837
They got too exhausted
that they wanted to hold out hope.

713
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,881
That's why they appointed me
as Inaishingi.

714
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,135
So I decided to consider

715
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,555
the Ago Tribe's selfish greed
and ugly desires

716
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,518
as God's voice and became Inaishingi.

717
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:56,313
So are you going
to follow their bad wishes

718
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,275
and steal, fight, shed blood,

719
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,694
and hit and kill to make them obey you?

720
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,154
A lot of people will die.

721
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:08,033
That is what Inaishingi should do
as he leads the war.

722
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,252
The mountain of corpses,
the river of blood,

723
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,711
and the cry of people.

724
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:21,630
Are these right?

725
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,261
The path to the right place
is full of wrong things.

726
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,512
The same goes for you.

727
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,349
Can you proclaim that Aramun was Igutu?

728
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,184
You know it now.

729
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,063
For a long time,

730
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,942
Arthdal killed, locked up,
and persecuted Igutu like me.

731
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,446
This is the "right thing"
that can stop them at once.

732
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:48,782
Will you do it?

733
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,704
If I proclaim that Aramun was Igutu...

734
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,791
there will be people
who won't acknowledge Tagon as Aramun.

735
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,295
Tagon will slaughter those people.

736
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,549
I'm responsible
for stopping the bloodshed.

737
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,680
Yes.

738
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,976
That must be
the right thing for you too.

739
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,813
The world is full of right things.

740
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:24,484
One right thing...
stops another right thing.

741
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,574
How long must I listen to this nonsense?

742
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,117
Taealha heard this too.

743
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,494
So did Mubaek.

744
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,832
Don't trust anyone, Tagon.

745
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,462
Before Sword comes, break Bell and Mirror.

746
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,380
Break Mirror first.

747
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,468
The day when Mirror reflects Sword
will be the end of your world.

748
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,555
Arthdal has been cultivated
by White Mountain Tribe

749
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:56,934
and Saenyeok Tribe for 1,000 years.

750
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,354
Don't be obsessed
with something trivial like Aramun.

751
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,814
Don't rely on Airuju either.

752
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:07,235
Up until 200 years ago,
there was no such God on this land.

753
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:11,531
Airuju is a God that Aramun brought
with him in the first place.

754
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,786
Fine, I understand.

755
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,121
Now, tell me...

756
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,209
where is my son?

757
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,546
How would I know that
when I'm locked up here?

758
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,342
You crazy old woman.

759
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,681
Now, I'll show you
my last psychic ability of the gods.

760
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,265
PSYCHIC ABILITY OF THE GODS

761
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,725
Look, Tagon.

762
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,959
Go, Tagon.

763
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,586
Go save your son

764
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,506
and welcome a new day.

765
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,056
If he's not in Ttesarichon...

766
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,161
Ttesarichon.

767
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,171
Didn't you say

768
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,799
your brother was here, in Ttesarichon?

769
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,888
Please wait for a while.
He'll be here soon.

770
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,147
Your brother won't come.

771
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,775
Answer me properly.

772
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,568
Who is he?

773
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,489
He's my nephew.

774
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,325
Why isn't my brother coming?

775
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,493
Your nephew?

776
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,788
What kind of lunatic
would bring her nephew to Ttesarichon?

777
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:27,793
I heard the son of that bastard, Tagon,
went missing.

778
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,504
No. Let me go!

779
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,047
Let me go, let me go!

780
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,677
- Look.
- This necklace.

781
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,930
Lonicera Flower and the Hammer of Wind.

782
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,182
TWO TOTEMS OF ARAMUN HAESULLA

783
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,646
Is this boy really Tagon's son?

784
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:48,980
Mihaje.

785
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,065
GOD OF A MINOR TRIBE

786
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,984
Thank you
for giving us the chance to take revenge.

787
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:59,282
No. Give him back. Give him back.
No, give him back.

788
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,087
Tanya.

789
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,549
There's a story
that might give you the courage

790
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,634
to do that right thing.

791
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,684
Niruha.

792
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,227
Doti.

793
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,770
The Whisper Organization found out.

794
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,855
TANYA'S ORGANIZATION

795
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,565
Prince Arok is in Ttesarichon.

796
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,732
Ttesarichon?

797
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,485
Why? Where is that?

798
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,864
It's a place where rebels
with their feet cut off,

799
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,616
criminals, runaways,
and even mercenaries live.

800
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,203
Let Taealha know quickly.

801
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,455
I'll go.

802
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,833
The place must be full of those
who resent Tagon.

803
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,084
Why would you go there?

804
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,546
If Tagon's son dies
or his blood is revealed,

805
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,048
something frightening might happen.

806
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,676
What do you mean?

807
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,263
Arok's blood? What about his blood?

808
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,893
There was one promise I made with Tagon
to protect the Wahan Tribe.

809
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,021
Since I don't need
to protect Wahan anymore,

810
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:12,814
this promise is broken too.

811
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,695
Tagon...

812
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,448
is Igutu.

813
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:34,002
Gather all troops on the outskirts
of Ttesarichon as discreetly as possible.

814
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,086
Pardon?

815
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,463
Did you say Ttesarichon?

816
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,591
- Why?
Actually,

817
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:43,261
someone from Ttesarichon made a fuss
saying he wanted to meet you,

818
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,638
so we captured him.

819
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,559
Before the sun sets,

820
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,270
come to the Ttesari Hill alone, Tagon.

821
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,398
You burned Nandal Mountain

822
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,401
and massacred the people
of the Bato Tribe and the Ggachinol Tribe.

823
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,780
You will pay for those sins today, Tagon.

824
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:06,785
If you wish to save your son,
you will have to sacrifice your life.

825
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,207
Go there alone.

826
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,891
- Gilseon.
- Yes.

827
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:32,352
Lead the guards and surround Ttesarichon.

828
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,980
I'll go on the hill on my own.

829
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,150
Your Majesty, you shouldn't.

830
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,361
Do not approach it without my order.

831
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:53,039
Niruha, the guards are going
to Ttesarichon.

832
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:57,252
Tell all the priests to assemble.

833
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,671
White Peak Mountain's Hearts too.

834
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,847
- Queen Taealha.
- I'm not in the right mind to listen.

835
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,473
Prince Arok is in Ttesarichon.

836
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:13,393
King Tagon headed to the Ttesari Hill
on his own.

837
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,022
You know that people living there

838
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:20,066
are those who've had their feet cut off
and eyes gouged out by the king.

839
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,276
Those fully functional

840
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:24,279
are swordsmen and mercenaries
from the Black Maru Corps.

841
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,656
FAMOUS MERCENARY CORPS IN ARTH

842
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,700
Only you can stop him, Queen Taealha.

843
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:06,905
Send him back.

844
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:12,285
If you do, in the names of Airuju,
Aramun, and the king of Arthdal,

845
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,954
I will guarantee your lives.

846
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:16,998
Only now?

847
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,959
It's too late.

848
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:22,420
We don't want our lives.

849
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,381
We only want revenge.

850
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:29,177
Try to kill us all and save your son.

851
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,264
If you want that so badly.

852
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,266
Kill him!

853
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:37,894
Kill him!

854
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,730
- Kill him!

855
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,168
Kill him.

856
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:01,769
Arok.

857
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,497
You are Igutu.

858
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,959
You cannot save your son.

859
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:29,297
Just like how I couldn't save my father

860
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,300
and my brothers from you.

861
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,475
We're going to offer your son to Mihaje.

862
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,102
You Igutu bastard.

863
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,556
Tagon.

864
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,186
You can't. Are you crazy?

865
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,606
Arok is in there.

866
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,108
I understand. Let's hide first.

867
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,282
Take off your clothes.

868
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,908
Let's wipe and cover your blood.

869
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:21,993
Arok.

870
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,411
I need to save Arok.

871
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,829
Not like this. Are you mad?

872
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,248
I just need to kill all of them.

873
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,043
Every single one of them,
as I always have.

874
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,420
How can you kill all those people
in Ttesarichon?

875
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,464
Gilseon and the guards will come.

876
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,716
I'll go. You should hide in here.

877
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,801
They are going to kill Arok.

878
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,470
If you go out like this,

879
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,264
even if we save Arok,
both you and I are done for!

880
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,693
It's Arok. I need to save him.

881
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:57,236
The ritual has begun.

882
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,197
Please get a grip!

883
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,282
I'll go. I'll save him.

884
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,575
Stay hidden here.

885
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,873
Cover yourself up completely.
You must never come out.

886
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:33,815
We'll make sure to kill Tagon
and avenge our parents and siblings.

887
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,693
In the name of Mihaje.

888
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,820
In the name of Mihaje.

889
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,613
In the name of Mihaje.

890
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:44,909
In the name of Mihaje.

891
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,912
In the name of Mihaje.

892
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,673
It's Taealha!

893
01:01:58,673 --> 01:01:59,882
It's the queen!

894
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,801
- Let's offer her to Mihaje.
- Kill her.

895
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,010
Kill her.

896
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,641
Kill her.

897
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:53,728
Kill her.

898
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,721
No, Tagon.

899
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,515
It's King Tagon.

900
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,854
Igutu. He's Igutu.

901
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:18,980
He's Igutu.

902
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,064
Kill him.

903
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,776
Kill him! Kill Tagon!

904
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,398
Arok.

905
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,233
Arok.

906
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,319
He's alive.

907
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,153
Arok.

908
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:16,717
Step back.

909
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,140
Step back.

910
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:25,142
No.

911
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:40,533
Your Majesty.

912
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,411
Your Majesty.

913
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,469
Igutu.

914
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:47,243
Tanya?

915
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:35,124
These are the words of Airuju.

916
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,168
These are the words of Airuju.

917
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:40,838
Airuju, the beginning and the end

918
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,966
of this world,
and the one who moves everything

919
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:47,428
woke me up today

920
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:50,806
and told me to find his son, Aramun.

921
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:55,311
I asked where I should find him
when he had ascended to heaven,

922
01:11:55,602 --> 01:12:00,190
and he showed me
Aramun Haesulla's tomb.

923
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,031
When I arrived at the tomb,

924
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:10,367
I found the coffin of Aramun Haesulla
who was murdered and locked up.

925
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:13,329
From Aramun's sacred body,

926
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,040
I saw purple blood.

927
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,254
Aramun of Haesulla came

928
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:24,506
as Igutu.

929
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,357
I, Asa Tanya, High Priest

930
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:44,902
and the reincarnation
of the Great Mother, Asa Sin,

931
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:47,112
hereby approve the doctrines

932
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,032
of White Peak Mountain's Hearts.

933
01:12:56,121 --> 01:13:00,167
Now that Aramun has reclaimed power
and nature,

934
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:05,214
Airuju has bestowed the purple blood
of the most sacred Aramun

935
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:10,052
as the proof of eternal blessings
to the heirs of Arthdal.

936
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,652
Tanya Niruha.

937
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,324
Tanya Niruha.

938
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:18,871
Tanya Niruha.

939
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,001
Tanya Niruha.

940
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,755
Tanya Niruha.

941
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:06,168
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

942
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,921
Igutu's blood
became sacred overnight.

943
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,048
Do you know why
I worked up the courage?

944
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:14,343
Aramun is Igutu, and so are you.

945
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,720
You will become Aramun Haesulla.

946
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,847
Inaishingi is here.

947
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,391
Inaishingi.

948
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:25,479
Niruha hid and helped Inaishingi,
the leader of the enemy.

949
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:28,148
If he's been caught by Taealha,
it's only a matter of time.

950
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:30,984
You also knew
that Saya wasn't Saya, didn't you?

951
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:33,987
I must kill everyone.
