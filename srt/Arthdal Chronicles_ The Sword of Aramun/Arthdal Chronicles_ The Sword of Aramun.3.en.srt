1
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:49,966
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

2
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,135
Let's go!

3
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,055
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

4
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,389
He's going for Lord Saya.

5
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,724
Chase him!

6
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,020
General.

7
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,646
You are a defeated general now.

8
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,861
I'll kill him right now.

9
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,237
Let my father go.

10
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,032
When Prince Arok turns 10,
I will give him divine powers.

11
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,241
What do you want to do?

12
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,787
A catastrophe
or Prince Arok's divine power?

13
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,706
You treat slaves and servants too nicely,

14
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,166
so a lot of people feel uncomfortable.

15
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,295
High Priest must not demand anything
to slaves' owners regarding their slaves.

16
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,922
I'll fill up 10 jars of sorghum

17
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,882
with gold.

18
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,968
You're not the only one ruling Arthdal
with fear.

19
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,805
Mubaek, can you arrange a meeting?

20
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,015
When I give you the sign tonight,

21
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,017
kill Inaishingi.

22
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,770
It is you. The person I saw in my dreams.

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,730
- That was you.
- Do you know your name?

24
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,982
What is my original name?

25
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,243
Leave. Why would you come in here?

26
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:18,930
WAHAN'S LOVER

27
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,369
Airuju, the beginning
and the end of everything in the world.

28
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,121
You gave birth

29
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,832
to everything in this world,

30
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,918
and there is nothing without a reason too.

31
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,046
You took Mubaek today

32
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,756
and there must be a reason to it,

33
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,968
but we're devastated because
we cannot understand

34
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,345
your meaning behind it.

35
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,598
Mubaek was King Tagon,

36
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,766
the reincarnation of Aramun Haesulla's
most trusted man.

37
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,893
FOUNDED THE ARTHDAL UNION 200 YEARS AGO

38
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,019
And his closest brother.

39
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,897
He was a brother to
every soldier of Arthdal

40
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,441
and our friend.

41
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,903
He dreamed of our happy world.

42
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,739
Take care of yourself
on the long journey.

43
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,909
Don't get injured.
Make sure you come back.

44
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,898
Please accept Mubaek.

45
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,320
Please let Mubaek rest in peace.

46
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,324
Miruhisha.
Miruhisha.

47
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,469
Hey! Hey!

48
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,887
- Let me go.
- Come on!

49
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,472
If we're wrong about this--

50
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,890
You saw the Crescent Dagger.

51
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,435
- It was Shahati.
- Yes, it was Shahati!

52
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,229
- But--
- Only the Asa Clan can summon the Shahati

53
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,232
and the Asa Clan follows Queen's orders.

54
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,083
Mubaek.

55
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,754
Mubaek.

56
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,596
What are we to do

57
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,390
now that Mubaek isn't around too, Niruha?

58
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,641
A TITLE OF HONOR

59
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,768
What about Saya?

60
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,687
Is he getting better?

61
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,273
The yakbachi said

62
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,110
it all depends on Lord Saya now.

63
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,362
DOCTOR

64
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,470
Today, I sent...

65
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:30,973
Mubaek away.

66
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,528
What happened?

67
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,322
Please wake up, Saya.

68
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,200
Please.

69
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,744
I don't think he will die.

70
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,833
If Lord Saya wakes up
and testifies about Shahati...

71
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,168
You will be put in a tight spot.

72
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,549
- Where is Asa Yon?
- He is in Ttesarichon...

73
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,675
A POOR VILLAGE
WHERE CRIMINALS LIVE

74
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,635
...so even the guards
won't be able to enter easily.

75
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,720
Tell him to leave.

76
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,681
Yes, Your Highness.

77
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,662
Priest.

78
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,416
Priest.

79
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,168
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,628
How can I help you?

81
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,589
My granddaughter is at

82
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,674
the entrance of Ttesarichon.

83
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,219
She wants to give me something,

84
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,805
but she is too scared to come in.

85
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,015
I see.

86
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,683
ASA YON

87
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,477
I'll go and meet her.

88
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,561
Thank you.

89
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,106
- Thank you so much.
- Oh...

90
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,919
Catch him.

91
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,513
Tell the king that
Commander Yeonbal requests

92
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,556
to meet him privately.

93
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,641
No.

94
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,809
You have to go through
all the procedures...

95
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,894
Just!

96
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,483
Just... inform the king.

97
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,567
You can tell me.

98
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,613
The final procedure to meet the king

99
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,115
is getting my permission anyway.

100
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,660
This is not something
I can talk to you about.

101
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,162
Let me meet the king.

102
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,247
I am

103
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,749
King Tagon's mouth and ears.

104
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,335
You can tell me.

105
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,920
I want to meet him in private!

106
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,886
Arthdal lost...

107
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,807
to the Ago Tribe.

108
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,142
Does this make sense?

109
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,437
You're a commander
who lost to the lowly Ago Tribe.

110
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,773
You even lost Mubaek.

111
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,567
How dare you raise your voice?

112
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,068
- What?
- You're alive

113
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,821
only because Mubaek died.

114
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,787
King Tagon said
Commander Yeonbal can come in.

115
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,342
Arok.

116
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,262
Go to your room and take a nap now.

117
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,848
Father.

118
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,225
Don't be too upset.

119
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,561
I'll become strong for you.

120
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,812
Sure.

121
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,897
But to do that, you must grow bigger.

122
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,899
You must get enough sleep.

123
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,360
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

124
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,926
It was the Shahati.

125
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,679
Mubaek was killed by the Shahati.

126
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,724
Only the Asa Clan knows
how to summon the Shahati,

127
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,934
and Queen Taealha is the one...

128
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,563
controlling the Shahati now.

129
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,649
- So?
- Prince Arok

130
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,442
must become the successor,

131
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,860
but Lord Saya is in the way.

132
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,072
Queen Taealha has
a clear motivation to harm Lord Saya.

133
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,659
Any evidence besides the Crescent Dagger?

134
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,827
Was there a Shahati tattoo on her back?

135
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,329
Was her tongue black?

136
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,997
The corpse

137
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,083
was burned completely,
so we couldn't tell.

138
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,335
- But the Crescent Dagger--
- Others use it too.

139
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,379
There's no child that can kill Mubaek

140
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,297
other than the Children of Shahati.

141
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,762
Due to all commanders
from the Daekan Force

142
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,889
leaving the frontline
except a small troop,

143
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,933
the Ago Tribe connected the supply route.

144
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,311
Tachukan of the Ago Tribe
broke through the Pyeongmire defense.

145
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,855
We should've defeated them
on the Hanchoa Plains,

146
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,233
but the battle reached stalemate.

147
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,026
How dare you come back

148
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,321
from the battlefront without my order
just because Mubaek died?

149
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,991
You'll have nothing
to say even if I execute all of you.

150
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,785
Yes, Your Majesty.

151
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,788
If you want me to take responsibility
for the defeat, I will.

152
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,373
I'll die.

153
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,750
- But Mubaek--
- You!

154
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,878
Who do you work for? Mubaek or me?

155
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,221
Are you trying to strike a deal

156
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,348
with Queen Taealha

157
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,642
using Mubaek's death?

158
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,315
Yeonbal...

159
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,110
this isn't like you.

160
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,194
No.

161
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,988
I'm not like myself.

162
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,198
But Tagon, the head of Daekan, is gone.

163
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,076
And Mubaek has gone to heaven,

164
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,412
so I must have lost my mind.

165
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,957
Get out.

166
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,926
We were late.

167
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,762
The Royal Guards took Asa Yon.

168
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,473
Asa Yon won't say a thing.

169
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,433
Of course he won't.

170
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,648
Wait...

171
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,317
Where are you going?

172
00:12:56,317 --> 00:13:01,113
Are you trying to get on his bad side?
Wait until the general wakes up at least.

173
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,698
What if he doesn't wake up?

174
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:06,160
Stop jinxing it. I'm feeling uneasy
as it is because of Kanmoreu.

175
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,870
ARAMUN'S LEGENDARY HORSE

176
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,580
I told you to stop that nonsense.

177
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,040
Kanmoreu?

178
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,249
How was that Kanmoreu?

179
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,210
Why would Kanmoreu let an Ago ride it?

180
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,463
Let me go, darn it.

181
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,547
You saw it too.

182
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,049
All our horses--

183
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,761
Those lowlives
must've done something to the horse.

184
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,223
The elite force of Arthdal

185
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,017
was defeated by those Ago beasts.

186
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,146
What do you think will happen

187
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,357
if rumors about Kanmoreu spread?

188
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,858
Think!

189
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,990
Kill Saya.

190
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,117
The order will not change.

191
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,581
Eunseom.

192
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,667
Run.

193
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,924
What's with that face?

194
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,967
ROYAL GUARD BAKRYANGPUNG

195
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,802
I need to see Saya.

196
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,265
He has not woken up yet.

197
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,559
Move aside.

198
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,766
Lord Saya.

199
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,643
Queen Taealha.

200
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,229
Why are you holding a sword?

201
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,106
Saya attacked me first.

202
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,282
Lord Saya!

203
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,411
What are you doing? Call a yakbachi!

204
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,996
Call a yakbachi now!

205
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,455
Yes, Your Highness.

206
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,708
Lord Saya. Wake up.

207
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,668
Lord Saya!

208
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,524
I heard he attacked the queen
as soon as he woke up.

209
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,403
I think he thought
he was still on a battlefield.

210
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,364
Will he wake up again?

211
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,699
Yes, of course.

212
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,702
Since he's an Igutu,
he will recover faster.

213
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,828
A HALF-SARAM, HALF-NEANTHAL PERSON

214
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,039
I concealed his lip color immediately.

215
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,957
No one would have noticed.

216
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,431
I am making sure
that she keeps her mouth shut.

217
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,197
TACHUKAN

218
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,870
IPSAENG

219
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,121
Did you find him?

220
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,790
No.

221
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,086
We searched the Wadu Forest,
the Geummal Mountain,

222
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,838
- and the Lake of Stars.
- And the way to Molabeol?

223
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,050
We combed every single place there too.

224
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,511
Oh, dear.

225
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,179
How can this happen?

226
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,847
Maybe Arthdal soldiers took him.

227
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,809
If they did, they would've told us
to surrender.

228
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,062
But the only rumor spreading
is the one where the Arthdal's general

229
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,272
got injured and went back to Arthdal.

230
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,274
If they discover that Inaishingi's gone,

231
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,360
the Ago Union is done for.

232
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,364
Tachukan barely managed
to connect the supply route, but...

233
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,742
How long can we last
without Inaishingi?

234
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,245
Anyway,

235
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,580
make sure to keep this between us.

236
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,374
Do you understand?

237
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,543
Nobody must find out.

238
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,294
Of course.

239
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,064
What we know
is that he disappeared

240
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,733
right after Mubaek came.

241
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,486
He is the one who last saw Inaishingi.

242
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,533
Saw him last?

243
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:24,872
No.

244
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,124
Syoreujagin.

245
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,042
Syoreujagin saw him last.

246
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,754
SYOREUJAGIN

247
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,923
Why are you asking me that?

248
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,467
I'll ask again.

249
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,970
What did you
and Inaishingi talk about that day?

250
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,391
I don't know.

251
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,060
Ask Inaishingi.

252
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,522
Do you think we're joking?

253
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,775
Ouch!

254
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,860
Talk.

255
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,820
You're not going to?

256
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,530
Are you not going to talk?

257
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,866
Talk!

258
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,950
Tell me, you punk.

259
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,869
If you don't, I'll kill you.

260
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,454
Talk!

261
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,080
You bastards.

262
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,832
Bastards.

263
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,083
You darn bastards.

264
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,252
At least tell me why you're beating me up.

265
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,171
Why are you asking me?

266
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,380
You damn bastards.

267
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,389
He disappeared.

268
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,683
Inaishingi disappeared.

269
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,065
Right? He disappeared, right?

270
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,525
Why else would you ask me that?

271
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,277
You bastard.

272
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,744
You know something, don't you?

273
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,579
You know something, right?

274
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,540
What did you two talk about that night?

275
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,125
Tell me.

276
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,336
That day,

277
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,797
he looked very serious.

278
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,884
I told him

279
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,803
I wouldn't go there if I were him.

280
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,681
But he must've gone there in the end.

281
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,933
So where is that place?

282
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,485
Hey.

283
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,405
Help us.

284
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,824
Please.

285
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,173
He was supposed
to meet Arthdal's general here?

286
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,009
What on earth?

287
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,593
Based on what I can see,

288
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,346
I don't know what tragedy happened here,

289
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,931
but he wasn't abducted.

290
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:51,476
If he was, the Arthdal troops
wouldn't stay so quiet...

291
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,022
Wait.

292
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,399
Arthdal's general went back
to Arthdal, right?

293
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,483
Hold on.

294
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,819
Then...

295
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,325
Maybe they were swapped.

296
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,077
What do you mean?

297
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,579
Something happened here,

298
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,164
and Arthdal soldiers confused...

299
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,416
Am I going too far?

300
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,960
What were they confused about?

301
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,046
They were confused, so they were swapped.

302
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,341
Inaishingi and the general of Arthdal

303
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,927
are benetbeot.

304
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,013
What?

305
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,432
You didn't know, right?

306
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,603
What nonsense is that?
Tell me properly. What benetbeot?

307
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,021
It's true.

308
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,445
Chaeeun?

309
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,739
What's true?

310
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,823
Do you know her?

311
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,909
Eunseom's benetbeot...

312
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,995
is Saya, the general of Arthdal.

313
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,708
You punks.

314
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,544
Why are you only believing it now?

315
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,629
Then

316
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,214
the general

317
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,342
that went back to Arthdal really is...

318
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,010
It might be Eunseom

319
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,806
if the general
really went back to Arthdal.

320
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,329
It's here.

321
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,665
This is how an opportunity comes.

322
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,543
Let's go to Arthdal.

323
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,753
Let's go and save Inaishingi.

324
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,256
Why would you do that?

325
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,424
Why not?

326
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,301
My guild recently went to Arthdal
for the first time.

327
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,054
- So?
- Inaishingi who is close with me

328
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,765
might have become the general of Arthdal.

329
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,767
This could be a golden opportunity.

330
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,811
Shut up, you lunatic.

331
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,689
Nothing's confirmed yet.

332
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,108
That is exactly why
we should go and check.

333
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,359
What if he's not there?

334
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,361
Is your union going to dissolve?

335
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:10,615
Without Inaishingi,
your union will break up into pieces.

336
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,784
Am I wrong?

337
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,495
I'm correct, right?
Then what should you do?

338
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,623
You must go with me.

339
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,168
If you guys go on your own,
how will you save him?

340
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,128
How will you pass the castle gate?

341
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,921
How will you enter the palace?

342
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,340
Come with us.

343
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,510
I beg of you.

344
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,015
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

345
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,810
The fate of the Ago Tribe
depends on Eunseom.

346
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,729
Please.

347
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,734
I have someone I need to treat.

348
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,237
It's very important to me.

349
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,418
ISSRUV

350
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,920
They're benetbeot?

351
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,922
They're Ragaz...

352
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,508
and Asa Hon's children.

353
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,677
Eunseom and Geumha.

354
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,388
He is Geumha.

355
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,099
He is the one I met

356
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,684
with Rottip...

357
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,604
Eunseom?

358
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,736
I think Eunseom went to Arthdal.

359
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,199
What are you going to do?

360
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,742
I should go too.

361
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,953
But I must save him

362
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,580
and bring him with me.

363
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,208
What is your relationship

364
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,585
with him?

365
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,673
If I don't come back
to Arthdal safe and sound...

366
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,971
who knows what might be
in her food that she'll eat in the palace?

367
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,558
I need to save him...

368
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,936
to save Nunbyeol.

369
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,700
"Queen Taealha told me
to send the Children of Shahati."

370
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,493
You just need to say that.

371
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,703
It's nothing difficult.

372
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,954
It's the truth too.

373
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,163
Right?

374
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,511
Should I cut off your ankles first?

375
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,431
You'll be happy crawling on the floor
with your old friends

376
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,309
in Ttesarichon forever.

377
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,729
- Won't you?

378
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,896
Do you think

379
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,693
I'll say what Tagon wants to hear?

380
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:08,001
Asa Yon won't talk.

381
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,504
Lord Saya might not remember
when he wakes up.

382
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,842
Whether he remembers or not,
whether he saw the Shahati or not,

383
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,052
Saya will say this...

384
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,097
"It's Taealha.
Taealha sent the Children of Shahati."

385
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,891
He has no reason not to say that.

386
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,062
Then shouldn't we get the prince
out of the palace first?

387
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,481
It is difficult to do so now.

388
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,026
Gilseon is managing everyone
who meets the prince.

389
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,780
Is it impossible
even if Her Highness goes in herself?

390
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,741
If we try to take Prince Arok out
in this situation,

391
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,618
they will make a big fuss.

392
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,497
What about the one you told me about?

393
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,873
Yes.

394
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:50,210
She's one of the servants
newly in charge of the prince.

395
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,171
Get her ready.

396
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,255
I understand.

397
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,892
Lord Saya.

398
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,603
Are you okay?

399
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,940
Are you awake now?

400
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,529
What happened?

401
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,531
What do you mean?

402
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,118
I...

403
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,496
attacked someone with a sword.

404
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,081
Right.

405
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,334
They said you probably mistook
Queen Taealha for your enemy

406
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,670
because you fainted in the battlefield.

407
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,714
Queen?

408
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,465
Yes. Queen Taealha.

409
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,468
Actually,

410
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,679
Queen Taealha is more or less your enemy.

411
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,641
Anyway, I'm relieved.

412
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,977
Everyone was waiting for you to wake up

413
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,146
because you need to testify.

414
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,106
Testify?

415
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,984
Yes, testify.

416
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,070
You must tell them who killed Mubaek

417
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,906
and who attacked you.

418
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,075
It was the Children of Shahati.

419
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,995
Queen Taealha ordered
the Children of Shahati to attack you.

420
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,999
Mubaek passed away,

421
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,543
but I will succeed him.

422
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,338
I'll tell King Tagon

423
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,841
and Tanya Niruha that you woke up.

424
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,135
Get ready.

425
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,852
Tanya?

426
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,656
MOA

427
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,866
It's so fascinating.

428
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,453
How can water spring
from a rock by itself like that?

429
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,663
It's also fascinating

430
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,249
how the water drains itself
when it's full.

431
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,711
The rock springs water by itself
with divine powers,

432
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,004
and when it's full,

433
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,507
the sacred water drains itself
to Arthdal's wells

434
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,592
with the Hae Tribe's technology.

435
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,222
Do you have anything to tell me?

436
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,767
Actually,

437
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,812
you said we all were the descendants
of Asa Sin.

438
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,898
Slaves, ministers, and merchants alike.

439
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,107
All of us.

440
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,527
You said I was the second descendant too.

441
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,778
I did.

442
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,279
What about it?

443
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,950
The third descendant said
it was too strange.

444
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,161
Actually, I find it strange too.

445
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,540
How could a mere slave like me...

446
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,042
Moa.

447
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,795
You have something else to say.

448
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,922
Niruha.

449
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,425
Can the second descendant of Asa Sin

450
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:48,346
relay the message to the first descendant
of Asa Sin in reverse?

451
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,598
Of course you can.

452
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,183
Go ahead.

453
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,061
The first descendant of Asa Sin

454
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,980
hears the second descendant's words.

455
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,610
I don't know which descendant
is asking this question.

456
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,547
High Priest Niruha.

457
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,884
JEUNGSUGAE

458
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,635
What brings you all the way here?

459
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,137
Is this where...

460
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,305
MINISTER

461
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,432
...the slaves working in your farm stay?

462
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,269
It's not a big farm.

463
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,771
- But why--
- It's nothing.

464
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,481
I'm just here to have a look.

465
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,359
Wait.

466
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,321
This is no place for someone like you.

467
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,822
It is a shabby place.

468
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,286
Why are you laughing?

469
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,872
I must be seeing things.

470
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,249
There shouldn't be anyone in Arthdal

471
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,169
who can get in the way
of the reincarnation of Asa Sin.

472
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,546
I'm wondering what this is in front of me.

473
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,363
Why

474
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,281
aren't you treating those

475
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,076
that are dying?

476
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,788
Niruha.

477
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,207
They're sick and wounded,
so they will die anyway.

478
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:43,336
Instead of healing them,
it's much better just to buy new slaves.

479
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,509
- Niruha.
- Are you higher than

480
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,971
Airuju who is in charge of lives?

481
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:58,977
Who are you to divide life and death
and discriminate lives?

482
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,061
Niruha.

483
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,604
Please forgive me.

484
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,815
I selected those with a lot of slaves

485
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,067
and gave them a lot more blessings
and totems

486
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,569
and you promised to
take good care of them.

487
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,448
You betrayed my faith

488
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,493
and severed the promise with God.

489
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,502
How will you reconnect

490
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,005
the severed promise?

491
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,674
I will take good care of them.

492
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,260
I will treat them immediately, Niruha.

493
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,179
What are you doing? Call the yakbachi.

494
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,604
The descendant of Asa Sin

495
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,607
who asked me a question must be here.

496
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,527
You asked

497
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,697
how can a sickly slave
become the descendant of Asa Sin.

498
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,615
I, Asa Tanya, High Priest

499
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,076
and the reincarnation of Asa Sin
will answer.

500
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,287
The descendants of Asa Sin

501
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,498
aren't decided by your lineage or status.

502
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,459
It is passed on via Asa Sin's will.

503
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,295
Whoever follows Asa Sin's will
is the descendant

504
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,130
of Asa Sin.

505
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,717
Tell this to everyone you meet.

506
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,028
Eat up. Is it good?

507
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,155
Here.

508
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,115
Eat up. Eat slowly.

509
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,784
Slowly, yes.

510
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,620
Oh, Niruha.

511
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,791
We, believers of
the White Peak Mountain's Hearts,

512
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,876
plan to join you in giving relief.

513
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,170
Is that so?

514
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,588
I'm grateful.

515
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,924
Airuju will look after you.

516
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,427
But everyone wants to know

517
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,514
when you will acknowledge our doctrine.

518
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,896
The time will come.

519
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:11,734
Right, Niruha.

520
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:17,490
She will make clothes
for children without proper clothing.

521
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,536
Thank you so much for volunteering
to do something so difficult.

522
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,287
It's nothing, Niruha.

523
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,707
I was able to come to Arthdal recently
and make fabrics

524
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,001
all thanks to Airuju and Niruha.

525
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,212
I'm just trying to repay the favor.

526
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,047
Actually,

527
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,176
I really like children
whether they're orphans or slaves.

528
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,059
Niruha, isn't my flower decoration pretty?

529
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,270
Yes.

530
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,689
It is very pretty.

531
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,275
I'm sure Asa Sin will like it too.

532
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,318
Here.

533
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,237
Is this for me?

534
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,864
Goodness.

535
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,658
Hey. Gosh.

536
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,076
Hey.

537
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,161
Give me that.

538
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,496
- Brats.

539
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,540
Is it fun? Is it?

540
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,666
Yes.

541
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,043
My goodness.

542
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,171
How strange.

543
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,299
At that age, even that must be fun.

544
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,301
It is fun.

545
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,803
It is indeed.

546
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,930
That is

547
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,183
a kind of illness.

548
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,523
That's what Eunseom always used to say.

549
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,483
He did.

550
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,944
When I asked what was so fun about it...

551
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,655
he would just say it was fun.

552
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,075
He thought it was kind of an illness.

553
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,194
Lord Saya.

554
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,662
Are you okay?

555
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,875
No, don't bother.
We now have two more slaves.

556
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,877
It's all thanks to you.

557
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,546
Are you okay, Lord Saya?

558
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,344
None of your business.

559
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,096
Lord Saya.

560
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,224
How dare you stop me?

561
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,809
I apologize.

562
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,090
Lord Saya!

563
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,718
You're awake.

564
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,094
Ishillobu dikeva.

565
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,346
GOD'S CARE

566
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,431
Gosh.

567
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,353
I apologize.

568
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,314
I must've startled you.

569
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,858
Airuju must've taken care of you.

570
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,443
Well...

571
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,070
- Yes.

572
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,324
If it's okay with you,
would you like to get a report?

573
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,337
Why are you looking at me like that?

574
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,258
It's nothing.

575
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,224
What happened to the front?

576
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,893
It has reached stalemate.

577
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,105
We're confronting the Ago Tribe
with Bijaram Canyon as the border.

578
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,484
Then Arthdal...

579
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,867
Did our troops retreat?

580
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,035
Well...

581
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:35,331
After Mubaek died,
you couldn't give them orders...

582
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,792
Yeonbal and Gitoha.

583
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,837
It was because these two commanders
abandoned the front and came back.

584
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,131
What do you mean we abandoned it?

585
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,300
How can you say that?

586
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,760
How else can I phrase it?

587
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,012
The front has reached stalemate,

588
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,931
and the war became prolonged
thanks to you.

589
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,229
Your Highness.

590
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,313
It's bad news.

591
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,942
Lord Saya woke up.

592
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,903
He's walking around and everything.
He's perfectly fine.

593
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,240
Lord Saya will testify soon.

594
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,408
What should we do?

595
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,451
I brought her here.

596
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,540
She's the one I told you about.

597
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,501
She's one of the servants
serving the prince.

598
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,878
NUNBYEOL

599
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,839
Yes.

600
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,090
I'm counting on you.

601
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,002
You.

602
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,712
What is that?

603
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,048
Well...

604
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,050
- It is laundry.
- Laundry?

605
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,511
Laundry's done over there.

606
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,513
Uncover it.

607
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,893
What are you doing? Uncover it quickly.

608
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,479
I can deal with them

609
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,064
in a second.

610
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,566
What is she saying?

611
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,378
- Good job.
- It was nothing.

612
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,511
Excuse me.

613
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,139
Can I become a servant

614
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,934
who serves the king now?

615
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,647
The queen will remember you.

616
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,815
Just wait.

617
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,105
You're back, sir.

618
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,900
Why is everyone here?
What about the guild?

619
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,361
Get back to your posts and work.

620
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,656
I have business to attend
with my guests over here.

621
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,074
I understand.

622
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,957
"I have business
to attend with my guests."

623
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,750
Goodness.

624
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,961
You have no idea
how many people work for me

625
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,755
and how much wealth I manage.

626
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,799
How are we going to meet the general now?

627
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,510
We should get going soon.

628
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,137
Before that,

629
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,057
let's go see a familiar face.

630
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,061
There's someone I want to surprise too.

631
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,146
Let's go.

632
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,690
- Hey.
- What is he saying?

633
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,403
Doti?

634
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,030
You're Doti?

635
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,700
Susu Dalsae.

636
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,493
A TERM WHICH REFERS TO MALES

637
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,786
Doti. Dalsae.

638
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,954
- What?
- Wait.

639
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,039
Go in.

640
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,834
You bastard. Go in, bastard.

641
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,836
- Gosh. Don't push me.
- Go in.

642
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,046
I got it. I'm going in.

643
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,841
You're going to swallow a fly, you haho.

644
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,259
A SERVANT

645
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,510
Are you really Susu Dalsae?

646
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:00,596
What happened?

647
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,474
You survived

648
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,310
and now you're all grown up, Doti.

649
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,729
How did you guys come here?

650
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,731
On horse, of course. We didn't fly here.

651
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,776
This is impossible.

652
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,986
You and you.

653
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,281
You guys traveling together
doesn't make sense to begin with.

654
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:22,993
Should I tell you something
that makes even less sense?

655
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,579
I am the head

656
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,165
of the Hamji Guild

657
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,584
that entered Arthdal recently!

658
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,920
- What?

659
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,047
What nonsense is this madman saying?

660
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,383
The head of Hamji Guild is--

661
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,803
That's me, you pathetic haho.

662
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:41,887
How dare you?

663
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:45,140
- You bastard.
- Let me go. It hurts.

664
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,990
What? He didn't come?

665
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,368
He clearly said he would go see the king.

666
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,870
Are you sure?

667
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,997
- Did you stand guard the whole time?
Yes.

668
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:12,209
I last saw him in the western corridor.

669
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,293
What?

670
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,379
And you just let him go?

671
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,221
Don't you know how important
what Lord Saya might say is?

672
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,515
The court meeting will start soon.

673
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,726
If the queen were to hurt him...

674
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,396
Search everywhere
from the palace to the marketplace

675
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,357
- and every alley around it!
- Right away, sir.

676
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,786
The general disappeared.
Everyone is looking for him.

677
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,039
- Did he get caught?
- Eunseom might've escaped.

678
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,292
Yes.

679
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,501
If he got caught,

680
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,420
the palace would've been in an uproar.

681
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,964
Did he escape?

682
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,340
If he didn't,

683
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,426
we must find him first.

684
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,094
Yes, of course.

685
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,473
Firstly, start searching
from the bottom of the western gate.

686
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,892
I'll make my men look for him
from the south

687
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,268
of the Great Gochiju Rock--

688
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,728
Why are you so enthusiastic?

689
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,521
How should I say this?

690
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,983
I have the feeling
that something big might happen.

691
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,651
Gosh.

692
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,664
Search thoroughly.

693
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,709
He has yet to fully recover,
so he might have fainted somewhere.

694
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,002
Yes, sir!

695
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,891
I can control my breath now.

696
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,521
I could easily tear you apart now.

697
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,648
Tell me properly.

698
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,568
Where is my sister?

699
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,986
Nunbyeol?

700
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,113
Why are you back alone? Where's my sister?

701
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,699
Where is my sister?

702
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,493
Lord Saya?

703
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,081
It is you.

704
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,752
Kill Saya. The order will not change.

705
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,300
He's talking with me.

706
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:19,938
Who is she?

707
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,986
Where is my sister?

708
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,953
You're not Saya.

709
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,624
What happened?

710
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,584
Why are you in Arthdal? Where's Saya?

711
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,629
Have you heard about my sister?

712
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,631
Your sister is safe.

713
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:51,929
Inaishingi.

714
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,187
Why didn't you come with my sister?

715
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,898
She said there was someone
she had to treat.

716
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,358
She said it was important.

717
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,444
Could that person be

718
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,279
Saya?

719
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,864
I think so.

720
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,743
She must've thought she had
to bring Saya for me to be safe.

721
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,662
You must go back now.

722
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,871
Everyone is so anxious.

723
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:20,290
Beyond that wall
is the royal guards' lodging.

724
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,210
A lot of them know your face
and something might happen.

725
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,213
Merchants will use the northern gate
at night. We'll leave then.

726
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,674
How do you know about Arthdal so well?

727
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,927
Syoreujagin said
we can leave with his guild's goods.

728
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,762
You came with Syoreujagin?

729
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,931
I'll explain on the way. Let's get moving.

730
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,315
Nunbyeol. When I go back,

731
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,527
I'll find your sister
and send her back safely.

732
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,822
- I promise.
- Thank you.

733
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,906
Please help me.

734
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:58,370
By the way, how did you know it was me?

735
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,122
No one could tell.

736
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,624
Sarams won't know,

737
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,877
but you two have different smells.

738
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,845
Are you Doti?

739
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,431
Are you really Doti?

740
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,808
Susu Eunseom.

741
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,396
Excuse me.

742
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,189
Eunseom.

743
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,692
It's nice to see you and all,

744
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:32,195
but how long will you stay here?

745
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,448
He'll be here as long as he wants.

746
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:38,869
Don't worry.

747
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,078
I'm going to leave soon.

748
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,164
Is that so?

749
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:43,790
Of course.

750
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,462
Inaishingi is in my house.

751
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,392
Inaishingi is in my house.

752
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,103
Inaishingi is in my house.

753
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:06,855
Have you seen the general?

754
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:11,526
Gosh.

755
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,404
He is...

756
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,573
Darn it.

757
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,707
Are you just going to leave?

758
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:31,129
Maybe we could meet
the Wahan Tribe before we leave.

759
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,673
No. We can't meet anyone.

760
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,802
Both you and I.

761
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,804
What did Yakdu say before he died?

762
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,639
- What did he say--
- Now's not the time.

763
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,143
We must hurry up. We're already late.

764
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,063
We must not meet anyone from Wahan.

765
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,481
This is an order.

766
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,150
Then what about Tanya?

767
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,613
Tanya's been looking
for Susu Eunseom continuously.

768
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,864
She missed you so much.

769
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,163
The soldiers are searching

770
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,791
for Lord Saya all over the marketplace.

771
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,876
Shop owner, come out.

772
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,257
Did Lord Saya come here...

773
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,805
Lord Saya. You were here.

774
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:22,889
What happened?

775
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:23,974
What do you mean?

776
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,893
You disappeared before the court meeting,
so everyone's panicking.

777
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,067
Is he the one?

778
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,027
The guy who betrayed the Wahan Tribe?

779
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,196
Yes.
I didn't expect to see him here.

780
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,199
What do you want to do?

781
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,826
Why are there so many soldiers?

782
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,995
Should we just do it now?

783
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,580
Tanya Niruha will be there too.

784
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,543
She was desperately waiting
for you to wake up.

785
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:56,756
Let's go.

786
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,978
What will Lord Saya say?

787
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,940
Lord Saya will go straight
to the reception room.

788
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,233
Captain.

789
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,860
- Yes.
- Before his testimony starts,

790
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,737
place more guards in the room.

791
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,197
I already gave the order.

792
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,616
Place one troop to the east
of the Gambal Mountain

793
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,368
in front of the Fortress of Fire
and wait for the order.

794
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,287
You don't know what the queen might do

795
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,581
once Lord Saya gives his testimony.

796
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,584
We must be very careful

797
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,211
to avoid any mishap.

798
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:35,879
Yes, sir.

799
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,640
I was happy to hear that you woke up.

800
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,601
Airuju looked after you.

801
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,628
Let us go, General.

802
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,267
Have you fully recovered?

803
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,187
Was it really Taealha's doing?

804
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,607
Both you and Mubaek.

805
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,697
But then again,
that's not important, is that?

806
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,243
Regardless of who it was,
your testimony would be the same.

807
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:35,790
Shahati.

808
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,669
Can we get rid of
the queen just with that?

809
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,174
Well, the king must've prepared
the next steps.

810
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,427
He'll throw you out because you lost,

811
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:51,473
and he'll hold the queen accountable
for Mubaek's death and throw her out.

812
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:02,776
Did you meet him?

813
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,031
Did you meet your benetbeot?

814
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:11,493
Did you meet him?

815
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,779
Saya...

816
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:50,949
don't do this.

817
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,586
Saya...

818
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,506
stop.

819
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,542
The world

820
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:44,794
is fun.

821
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:50,592
It must be some kind of an illness.

822
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,455
My Queen.

823
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,121
High Priest Niruha.

824
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,417
It was the Children of Shahati.

825
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:51,045
Queen Taealha ordered
the Children of Shahati to attack you.

826
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,047
He'll throw you out because you lost,

827
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:57,176
and he'll hold the queen accountable
for Mubaek's death and throw her out.

828
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,640
Taealha, the queen.

829
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,489
Lord Saya.

830
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,533
Let me ask you this first.

831
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:25,455
That day, why did you go
to the warehouse in Hanchoa with Mubaek?

832
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,130
It's not something I can say here.

833
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,841
It's related to Mubaek's death.

834
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,760
General, answer him.

835
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,222
I followed Mubaek

836
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,101
because he said
there was someone I needed to meet.

837
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,394
Who was that someone?

838
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,564
I... don't know.

839
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,651
You don't know? That doesn't make sense.

840
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,902
I didn't ask him.

841
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,320
Why?

842
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,823
Because he was Mubaek.

843
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:05,870
You trusted Mubaek fully and followed him,
but you got attacked?

844
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,373
Yes. As soon as I entered the warehouse,

845
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,749
they attacked us.

846
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,709
And it caught on fire.

847
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,839
Actually,

848
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,509
my memory of that day isn't clear.

849
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:23,304
What kind of knife did the attacker use?

850
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,022
It was a strangely shaped knife.

851
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:34,899
Strangely shaped knife?

852
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,235
Was it a knife you saw for the first time?

853
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,237
Wasn't it this knife?

854
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,364
He said it was a strange knife.

855
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,617
If it wasn't that knife,
then they weren't the Children of Shahati.

856
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:46,744
Lord Saya. It was this knife.

857
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,789
That knife...

858
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,593
Lord Saya?

859
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,474
Don't you know the name

860
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,269
of that dagger?

861
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,773
There's no way

862
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,400
- he wouldn't know its name.
- No.

863
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,527
Keep quiet.

864
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,448
Lord Saya. What is the name

865
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:25,324
of that dagger?

866
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:36,586
Eunseom.

867
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,091
Eunseom.

868
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,848
It's Crescent Dagger.

869
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,810
It's Crescent Dagger, Eunseom.

870
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:01,068
If it was the Crescent Dagger,

871
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,198
would I have said
it was a strangely shaped knife?

872
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,786
It wasn't the Crescent Dagger.

873
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,538
Lord Saya.
That doesn't make sense.

874
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,916
This was found on the site.

875
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:18,503
Whoever attacked Mubaek later
might have had the Crescent Dagger.

876
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,587
But...

877
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,257
I didn't see them.

878
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,009
It wasn't the Children of Shahati?

879
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:28,846
Then can you draw the sword?

880
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,174
The knife looked like this.

881
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,305
I've never seen
such a knife before.

882
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,682
How is that a knife?

883
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,061
If it wasn't the Children of Shahati,
who was it, General?

884
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:18,938
I feel very frustrated myself.

885
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,022
And actually,

886
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,984
I'm not certain about that drawing either.

887
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,735
The memory of that day is very faint.

888
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:30,700
But I think I saw someone in the fire.

889
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,871
That might or might not have been
the Children of Shahati.

890
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:36,664
But...

891
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,544
I will remember.

892
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,337
Certainly.

893
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,228
You did well.

894
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,398
You should get some rest.
Your memories will come back to you.

895
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,778
High Priest Niruha has arrived.

896
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:23,020
When did you discuss
what to say with Saya?

897
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,315
I never did, my King.

898
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,111
If that wasn't the case,

899
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,322
you wouldn't have come here
without any plan,

900
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,241
my Queen.

901
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,288
I did have a plan,

902
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,125
but that wasn't it.

903
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,710
I see.

904
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:47,628
Is that so?

905
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:49,213
My Queen.

906
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,893
Why did Lord Saya do that?

907
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:04,353
You were shocked too, right?

908
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,689
What's with that strange sword?

909
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,984
And what should we do about the prince?

910
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,235
Should I send him back?

911
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,783
Your Highness, where are you going?

912
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,205
So that's what happened.

913
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:26,667
Then what about Saya?

914
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,546
I think he's alive.

915
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,548
Not sure how well, though.

916
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,883
Ah...

917
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,635
Thank goodness.

918
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:39,680
Although he wouldn't feel like
he was alive even if he was.

919
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:41,640
Why?

920
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:43,559
Because he lost the war.

921
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:47,605
Saya might be thinking he got eliminated
from the battle of the heirs.

922
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,901
By the way,

923
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:55,571
how could I hear your voice just now?

924
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,033
I think

925
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,869
I developed the psychic ability
of the gods.

926
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,499
It would've been nice
if Mother Choseol saw this.

927
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,251
I'm sure she will see it.

928
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,837
I'm sure she's always watching you

929
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:13,923
to check if you're doing as she said.

930
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,219
By the way,

931
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:20,930
was it really not the Children of Shahati?

932
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,599
No. It was.

933
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,559
Saya said that too.

934
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,604
Then why didn't you say that?

935
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:32,066
Looking at you

936
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,985
made me want to do something fun.

937
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:36,904
What are you planning to do?

938
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:41,951
More importantly,
there's something you must know.

939
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,035
What is it?

940
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:47,081
It's for you and I,
and everyone else in the world.

941
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:48,457
What is it?

942
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:54,296
You make it sound so grand.
What is it?

943
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,842
The queen has arrived.

944
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,186
Gosh.

945
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:12,815
I didn't expect to see you here,
High Priest Niruha.

946
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,233
You must have come here

947
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:17,153
because you were worried
about the general as well.

948
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:21,532
Well, it seems like
I don't have to worry about him.

949
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:24,368
Should I come back later?

950
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:25,452
You don't have to.

951
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:29,165
Yes, High Priest Niruha.

952
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,458
I will go to the Great Shrine to see you.

953
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:49,560
Find someone to search for Saya.

954
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,896
Sorry? What do you mean?

955
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,189
He was in there.

956
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,399
I'll explain as we go.

957
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,446
You came earlier than I thought.

958
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,366
You look very relaxed.

959
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,871
Crescent Dagger?

960
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:13,500
You must have a lot
of questions to ask me.

961
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:15,920
No.

962
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:18,631
I only have one question.

963
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:21,258
Why...

964
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,345
did I testify like that?

965
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:27,014
I'd like to know that too.

966
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:32,186
But that's not what I really want to know.

967
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:34,897
Then what is it?

968
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:37,274
I'd like to know now.

969
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:38,359
Well...

970
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:40,694
What I want to ask...

971
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,572
is nothing much.

972
01:10:51,538 --> 01:10:53,707
Just who are you

973
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:56,293
and why are you pretending to be Saya?

974
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,550
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

975
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:47,678
What do you mean by the man
who has the same face as Lord Saya?

976
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:50,139
You must've known
something, Niruha.

977
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,724
He must be Eunseom.

978
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:52,850
He's Eunseom, right?

979
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,060
We must work together
and kill him.

980
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,437
That's how we can survive.

981
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,064
Don't trust anyone, Tagon.

982
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,401
You will pay
for those sins today, Tagon.

983
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,028
I just need to kill all of them.

984
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:06,739
Every single one of them,
as I always have.

985
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:09,992
Igutu...

986
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:11,952
No...
