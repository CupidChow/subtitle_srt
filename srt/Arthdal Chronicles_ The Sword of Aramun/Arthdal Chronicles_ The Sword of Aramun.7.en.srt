1
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:49,966
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

2
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,385
Tell her! I, Eunseom of the Wahan Tribe,

3
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,889
will become Inaishingi
and Aramun Haesulla!

4
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,099
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

5
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,143
Inaishingi has returned.

6
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,479
I knew you would come back alive.

7
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,023
Are you really going
to pretend to be Inaishingi?

8
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,942
Eunseom took my place.
I don't see why I can't do the same.

9
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,570
You know.

10
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,365
Tachukan!

11
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,202
What nonsense is that?

12
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:24,375
Do you really think
people consider Igutus as sacred

13
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,253
and are praising you?

14
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,672
You must kill everyone now.

15
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,925
How you're acquainted with

16
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,385
Saya's benetbeot.

17
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:38,139
By any chance,
are you thinking of another Aramun?

18
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,474
It's the sword of Aramun.

19
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,770
"When the zelkova tree cracks
and my sword is revealed,

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,022
Aramun shall know their mission."

21
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,400
If the sword has been revealed
but I do not know the mission,

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,027
does that mean I am not Aramun?

23
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,321
Apprehend every man

24
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:57,033
born in the year of the singing wolf
in Arthdal and in the vicinity of Arthdal.

25
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,494
We received amazing intelligence.

26
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,664
It says the supplies will be
moved from Hanta Dock to the forest.

27
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,998
I will lead them myself.

28
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,671
It's a trap.

29
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,964
Retreat!

30
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:30,316
IKOMAHIS

31
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,812
WAHAN TRIBE, EUNSEOM'S FRIEND

32
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,899
You've complicated everything.

33
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,568
If I cut your throat here
and buried your body,

34
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,070
it would make things a lot easier.

35
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,616
Is there a reason I shouldn't kill you?

36
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,076
A reason? There is.

37
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,580
You don't want me to die.

38
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,664
Me?

39
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,958
Why would I not?

40
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,668
You're the leader of the enemy,

41
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:34,297
you took my place while I was gone,
and fooled us, the Ago Tribe.

42
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,813
You must be feeling proud
after winning once.

43
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:54,651
You could get lucky
and take over Molabeol Castle.

44
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,278
Then Arthdal will send more troops,

45
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,031
more soldiers, and more powerful weapons.

46
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,201
The blood of thousands
of the Ago Tribe will flow.

47
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:10,667
Only then, you will realize
that you led all of them to their death.

48
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,295
We won.

49
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,546
We will continue to win.

50
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,423
Your bronze swords came from Arthdal.

51
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,593
After a few more fights,
half will become useless.

52
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,806
You lot cannot even make
nor fix bronze swords.

53
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,557
What will happen?

54
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,726
Continue.

55
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,687
What does the Ago Tribe fight with?

56
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,938
Willpower?

57
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,856
Desperation?

58
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,650
The divine power of Inaishingi?

59
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,610
Right.

60
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,947
Will that strange horse pretending
to be Kanmoreu solve everything?

61
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,283
LEGENDARY HORSE KNOWN
TO HAVE BEEN RIDDEN BY ARAMUN HAESULLA

62
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,244
Is that why I cannot kill you?

63
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,412
What's worse is,

64
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,874
Arthdal will be armed
with iron swords soon.

65
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,545
I guess you know what those are.

66
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,422
You must know for sure now.

67
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,049
You guys won once

68
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,677
just by chance.

69
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,014
Drop your weapons.

70
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,685
CHOMO

71
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,228
TAE DACHI

72
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,486
BADORU

73
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,746
You know you're going to lose,
but you'll lie to them that you can win.

74
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,707
You must've felt touched
as you gave them hope

75
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:37,754
and received endless praise and love
from the children of Ago.

76
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,881
It must've been overwhelming.

77
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,301
Those children don't even know
you're the gosal that will kill them.

78
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,427
REVENGEFUL SPIRIT

79
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:48,306
They'll just helplessly die
in your arms, you bastard.

80
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,601
You risked your life too?

81
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,770
What about your life?

82
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,772
Is your life so great?

83
00:05:55,772 --> 00:06:00,109
Is your life worth so many people's lives?

84
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:04,989
You...

85
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,617
You really are like Inaishingi.

86
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,371
- Don't mock me.
- No.

87
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,873
I mean it.

88
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,210
In that short amount of time
you imitated me, you've become serious.

89
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,423
You were praised by people,

90
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,968
you got excited by their expectations,

91
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:32,725
and you were touched and overwhelmed
by the children's endless love for you.

92
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,352
Right?

93
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,481
You want to be cherished, don't you?

94
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,110
What?

95
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,153
I'm not Tagon.

96
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,281
I don't rely on such things and hesitate.

97
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,409
I don't live like a fool.

98
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,077
No, you want it.

99
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:56,165
You just learned very early
that you couldn't have it.

100
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,751
How do I know?

101
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,088
It was for a short while, but I...

102
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,675
lived as you.

103
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,348
Why did you stop?

104
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,684
You seem to be very angry. Aren't you?

105
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,735
Let's form an alliance.

106
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,070
Why?

107
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,533
- Why should I?
- That is the only way you can win.

108
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,874
Then why do you want it?

109
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,568
Throw that here.

110
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,488
- What?
- I said, throw that here.

111
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,911
Gosh.

112
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,955
Throw that to me.

113
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,048
Huh? Hurry.

114
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,095
- Me?
- You.

115
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,184
You're not the guy from back then.

116
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,978
There was someone else
with that hairstyle.

117
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,193
You bastards.

118
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,153
How dare you walk away?

119
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,245
Then how should we go?

120
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,873
Should I bow?

121
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,631
That lunatic.

122
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,924
Hey.

123
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,469
You came to save
these Ago bastards, didn't you?

124
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,389
They're the Ago Tribe?

125
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,798
You're slow.

126
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,513
Mm...

127
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,731
Thank you.

128
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,316
Please untie me.

129
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,702
He looks strong.

130
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,080
Tie him tighter.

131
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,915
Are you not here to save us?

132
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,418
Where is Hae Kkadak?

133
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,504
"Hae" what?

134
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,756
Gosh, Hae Kkadak.

135
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,840
Where have you been?

136
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,966
Let's leave.
- What?

137
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,678
You said you needed to ask
what "Ikomahis" was.

138
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,807
Did you know
that your friend had a benetbeot?

139
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,768
What? What are you talking about?

140
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,271
Stop changing the subject.
Let's help Eunseom.

141
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,856
Father, let's do that.

142
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,192
We can't go back to the Hae Tribe anyway.

143
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,985
You said Taealha killed Mihol.

144
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,154
You said you'll need an army if they come.

145
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,615
Eunseom even beat Arthdal's army.

146
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,993
He can't win in the end.
They lack weapons and supplies.

147
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,830
What if you make them?

148
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,708
How can I make them?

149
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,084
The Lake of Stars.

150
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,503
- Right? We found it.
- Yes.

151
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,255
There's no way to take it out.

152
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,799
Don't even bring that up.

153
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,364
Inaishingi, are you okay?

154
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,409
I heard you were ambushed by
soldiers from Arthdal.

155
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,702
Things could have been...

156
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,581
Gosh, how are you...

157
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,752
Inaishingi, how did you meet Dalsae?

158
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,925
There definitely is a yeomari,
just as I thought.

159
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,010
A SPY

160
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,928
Still, I'm very glad that you're safe.

161
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,973
Did everyone come back?

162
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:50,269
Badoru, Dachi, and Chomo
have not come back yet.

163
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,775
We're checking on them.

164
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,611
Let me know when they get back.

165
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,614
- I will.
- And release Ipsaeng.

166
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,450
Why release Ipsaeng?

167
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,368
He was bait to catch the yeomari.

168
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,204
He was bait?

169
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,498
Gosh, how...

170
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,541
I'll explain later.

171
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,753
I understand.

172
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,464
So the yeomari...

173
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,511
Not yet. But we will find out soon enough.

174
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,014
Yes, we must.

175
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,982
What will you do now?

176
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,985
Myonita will recover, and the epidemic--

177
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,654
- What about Myonita?
- What?

178
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,532
Hey, do you find this situation fun?

179
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,492
Is Myonita hurt?

180
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,661
What are you playing at?

181
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,705
I can't even sleep
because I'm worried about Nunbyeol.

182
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,544
Nunbyeol is fine.

183
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,713
- How do you know that?
- I met her in Arthdal.

184
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,175
Nunbyeol was worried about you.

185
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,223
Dalsae?

186
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,479
Are you Eunseom?

187
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,357
What happened? Where's Saya?

188
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,703
Then why do you want it?
- The same goes for me.

189
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,581
That is the only way I can win.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,334
Because you lost the war

191
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,587
and you've been eliminated as the heir?

192
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,172
Yes.

193
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,632
I have to beat Tagon now.

194
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,386
Let's form an alliance.

195
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,522
How foolish.

196
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,154
Then those Neanthals...

197
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,781
They left.
I don't know where they went.

198
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,827
But is Nunbyeol really okay?

199
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,330
Yes. She said everything will be fine

200
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,582
as long as you are okay,
and that she's all right.

201
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,336
Saya is in Molabeol Castle. Go there.

202
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,587
Dalsae will escort you.

203
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,840
Thank you.

204
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,225
By the way, you've changed a lot.

205
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,860
EUNSEOM'S ADVISOR

206
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,791
You did well.

207
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,923
- Does it hurt a lot?
- No.

208
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,049
It will heal soon.

209
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,428
- Where's that bastard?
- He left to Molabeol.

210
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,638
You just let him go?

211
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,764
Why let that punk go?

212
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,266
There's a more important matter at hand.

213
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,352
Call a meeting.

214
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,175
Stay still.

215
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,635
You move and I will cut you.

216
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,811
WAHAN TRIBE, SCRIBE

217
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,201
It's unbelievably light.

218
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,997
It's sharp, strong, and even fast.

219
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,540
TANYA'S FATHER, A GYEOKMULSA

220
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,042
- Yeolson.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

221
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,462
You did it.

222
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,673
On top of that, you made so many swords
in a short time.

223
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,009
The minister and the bachis
he trained

224
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,303
worked on it day and night.

225
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,182
Good job, good job.

226
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,817
This sword will end the Hae Tribe
and the Bronze Age.

227
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,363
Poor Taealha.

228
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,990
Good swords have a name.

229
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,367
Name the sword, Your Majesty.

230
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,957
I'll call it the Sword of Seed.

231
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,709
Seed?

232
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,544
The seed of blood,

233
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,715
death, and prosperity.

234
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:17,012
Then I will engrave the name "Seed"
on the sword and offer it to you.

235
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,184
Is the sword that strong?

236
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:28,732
It was a sharp and fast sword,
but soft as waving a whip.

237
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,861
How can they make such a sword
with something like iron?

238
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,988
Moreover, if iron is the material,

239
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,283
they could make them easily, quickly,
and many at a time.

240
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,996
We have two options.

241
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,916
We could make them too.

242
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,752
Or...

243
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,547
steal from them.

244
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,464
Eventually, you'll succeed again.

245
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,385
I hope I will.

246
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,679
But I'm afraid.

247
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,098
I've never heard you say that.

248
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,517
But Inaishingi,

249
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,313
when you look back,
everything was impossible.

250
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,149
You survived the waterfall,

251
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,735
became Inaishingi
when you were just a stranger,

252
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,695
and reclaimed Doldambul, our old land.

253
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,657
None of these seemed possible.

254
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,289
But you made all of them happen.

255
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,584
"Only one out of Tae Apdok and Inaishingi

256
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,920
will see tomorrow's blue sky."

257
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,546
The day you prophesied as such,

258
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,758
I, Suhana, as if lured by a gwitgeot...

259
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,884
GHOST

260
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,470
...killed Tae Apdok
and made that prophecy come true.

261
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,514
Your words have such power.

262
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,809
Thank you.

263
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,188
You told us to find a way,
so it will happen again.

264
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,357
Believe in yourself.

265
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,152
But say that you're afraid

266
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,741
only in front of me.

267
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:45,953
Okay.

268
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,330
I will, Suhana.

269
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,376
Listen, Ago Tribe.

270
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,963
Listen, Ago Tribe.

271
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,757
Listen, Ago Tribe.

272
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,427
We are listening. Say the next part.
How many times has it been already?

273
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,890
Bring back our brothers.

274
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,975
Brothers?

275
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,059
TACHUKAN - TAE MAJA

276
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:14,564
If you don't,
we will kill your brother, Badaru.

277
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,233
You mean Badoru.

278
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,695
Anyway, we'll kill him.

279
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,865
We will kill Chomo and Dachi too.

280
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,077
Tomorrow at noon, bring our brothers

281
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,872
to the front of the Baku Cliff.

282
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,792
Who are your brothers?

283
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,419
Who do you want us to bring?

284
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,796
Our brothers,

285
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,841
Hae Kkadak, Ttaemun.

286
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,679
Buksoe.

287
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,432
Buksoe?

288
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,684
Bring them to us.

289
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,189
Hae Kkadak? What's that?

290
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,319
Hey. What was that all about?

291
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,116
Eunseom, what's wrong?

292
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,200
What?

293
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,910
Nothing.

294
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,163
By the way, you've changed a lot.

295
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,539
Even that hair.

296
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,499
This isn't the first time you saw it.

297
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,544
My hair kept growing this way.

298
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,008
Who are they?

299
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,595
Right. I was waiting
for the right time to introduce them.

300
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,306
This is Hae Kkadak
and this is his son, Hae Ttaemun.

301
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,560
Oh, so that really was a person's name.

302
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,063
Why is your name so weird?

303
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,482
Everything in the world has its reasons.

304
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,360
It's my mission to shine the light
upon them in the dark.

305
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,444
I see.

306
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,530
I had no idea it had such a deep meaning.

307
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,118
Some unknown people
abducted our warriors

308
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,037
and are demanding we take you to them.

309
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,373
- They said you were brothers.
What?

310
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,167
Brothers? Who...

311
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,252
I see, it must be them.

312
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,631
We were supposed to meet them.
They must've misunderstood.

313
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,551
But why brothers? We only met once.

314
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,053
Who are those people?

315
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,638
They have three of my brothers.

316
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,681
We don't really know either.

317
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,935
I needed to meet them
to talk about something. Don't worry.

318
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,355
Once the misunderstanding is cleared up,
they'll release your brothers.

319
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,604
You're here, Father.

320
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,526
What in the world are you doing?

321
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,778
What do you mean?

322
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,572
The sword of Aramun in Yuil Temple.

323
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,907
I made it and gave it to Eunseom.

324
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,243
What are you going to do with it?

325
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,579
Tanya!

326
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,749
When Eunseom comes to Arthdal,

327
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,502
he will hold that sword and become Aramun.

328
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,716
What? Eunseom cannot win.

329
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,385
Arthdal will be armed with iron swords.

330
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,429
Are you going to kill everyone with such

331
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,681
foolish actions
for a guy who's going to lose?

332
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,099
I'm trying to save everyone.

333
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,350
That's nonsense!

334
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,228
You said
that millions instead of thousands

335
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,189
will fight in wars in the Iron Age.

336
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,940
You are right.

337
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,567
You started the era of slaughter

338
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,819
where millions
instead of thousands will die.

339
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,030
Fine. But can you stop that?

340
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,074
Even Airuju cannot stop this,
not to mention Asa Sin.

341
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,076
I know. She can't stop it.

342
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,246
That is why the Great White Wolf,
Asa Sin, failed.

343
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,374
We were unable to give up
on anything we achieved,

344
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,211
but she went to Iark
and did an experiment to undo it.

345
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,631
There was nothing she could undo.

346
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,633
I know.

347
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,427
I know. I know I can't stop it.

348
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,095
I saw how you

349
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,725
and the Wahan Tribe
so easily threw away the teachings

350
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,728
that have been passed down
for more than 200 years, and changed.

351
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,731
How can I not know that?

352
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,815
Tanya.

353
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,027
That's why I'm going to do it.

354
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,156
In this unstoppable era of slaughter,
I should do what I have to do

355
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,284
as the descendant of the Great White Wolf.

356
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,702
What are you going to do?

357
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,996
I'll tell them God doesn't help people

358
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,040
and that only people help people.

359
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,584
If they don't help each other,

360
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,961
they'll all be done for.

361
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,629
I'll threaten them in God's name.

362
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,091
So, as we learned, the world--

363
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,801
The world, the world!

364
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,178
Stop talking about that. It's ridiculous.

365
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,390
Yes, it might be.

366
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,061
But I'll make preparations
at the very least.

367
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,147
A world ruled by Aramun and Inaishingi

368
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,235
where people don't have to fight
in this continent.

369
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,532
You're going to make
Eunseom become Aramun?

370
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,785
Eunseom can never win.

371
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,245
What if there's no Tagon?

372
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,456
What if he's really gone insane?

373
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:33,174
What in the world are you thinking?

374
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,734
"What if there's no Tagon?"
What do you mean by that?

375
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,242
The king isn't acting normal.

376
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,119
As you know.

377
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,537
So?

378
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,206
I'm not going to do anything right away. But...

379
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,960
you need to choose now.

380
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,213
I'll say this again.

381
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,175
I will not betray the king.

382
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,885
Then you must tell him everything.

383
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,887
Do it as soon as possible.

384
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,473
Do you think I won't?
I'll tell him right away.

385
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,016
You don't know

386
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,602
what kind of past the king and I had.

387
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,771
Do you know where my mother is?

388
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,190
- My mother--
- All options.

389
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,568
Evaluate all those options and choose.

390
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,450
Goodness, Niruha.
Are you insane?

391
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,578
Niruha.

392
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,143
This is Tanya Niruha's order.

393
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,896
Don't mess around
and get lost from Arthdal.

394
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,947
Here's the list of people who offered
a lot of wealth to the Great Shrine.

395
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,118
I got it.

396
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,205
Anything else to say?

397
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,710
Well...

398
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,256
If there's none, leave.

399
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,685
NUNBYEOL

400
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,355
Do you have family or friends
you can trust completely?

401
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:58,236
Yes. I have one, Your Majesty.

402
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,989
You have more than me, the king.

403
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,329
How long have you held back?

404
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,416
- I don't understand.
- Your mind.

405
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,460
Honest thoughts and emotions.

406
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,128
Hiding all of those,

407
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,006
being with those
you don't want to be with,

408
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,091
and enduring it
while waiting for the right time.

409
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,553
Could you do that for ten years?

410
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,308
I don't think
I could endure it for ten years.

411
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,562
I would do something before that,
whatever it is.

412
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,772
Yes.

413
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,900
I don't think
I can endure it any more either.

414
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,824
But there is someone who has endured it
for more than ten years.

415
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,919
TAEALHA'S SERVANT

416
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,136
ROYAL GUARD HEAD

417
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,568
I brought her as you ordered.

418
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,571
But why did you want the queen's servant?

419
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,573
Ten years.

420
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,534
You've waited for ten years.

421
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,328
Tell me everything now.

422
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,123
She's deaf and mute.

423
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,168
Your Majesty.

424
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,795
She can speak?

425
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:42,966
Since Mihol was alive until now,
it has been a long time.

426
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,926
Was she a yeomari?

427
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,469
I said

428
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,472
I would use you just once.

429
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,349
Today is the day.

430
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,685
Tell me the important things first.

431
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,271
First, ever since the Hanchoa War,

432
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,398
Lord Saya has never come to Arthdal.

433
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,280
- Are you okay?
- Can you hear?

434
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,823
I'm fine.
Goodness.

435
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,880
The king asked me to relay his orders.

436
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:26,426
Why? Where is the king, Royal Guard Head?

437
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,846
Your Highness, I do not know
as the order was relayed to me.

438
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,266
I will read them now.

439
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,187
The king gave three orders.

440
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,442
I will adhere to it.

441
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,611
First, Commander Dupa,

442
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,572
go to Molabeol Castle immediately
and relay the king's order.

443
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,950
I will. What order should I relay?

444
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,078
Molabeol's Commander Sodang,
Deputy Commander Daesayi,

445
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,705
and General Saya

446
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,041
shall return to Arthdal immediately.

447
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,504
Wait. He's calling in...
What?

448
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,215
the commanders in the front line
during the war?

449
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,218
It hasn't been long
since the general left for the front line.

450
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,889
Second, I appoint Commander Dupa
as the commander

451
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,933
in charge of the Ago's front line.

452
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,351
What?

453
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,144
Gosh.

454
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,398
I, Commander Dupa, will follow his order
and annihilate the Ago Tribe.

455
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,026
What is happening?

456
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,529
That is not the end of the orders.

457
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,239
The third and the last order.

458
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,201
A banquet hosted by the king
will be held soon.

459
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,955
He ordered everyone to attend it.

460
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,498
- A banquet?
- What?

461
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,708
- All of a sudden?
What is this?

462
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,341
Why is he calling back
Lord Saya out of the blue?

463
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,053
- Is there no news from Tamjo?
- Yes.

464
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,179
HAE YEOBI

465
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,556
If he found something,
he must've sent a message.

466
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,641
HAE TUAK

467
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,228
If Lord Saya were alive, there's no reason
for him not to have come back yet.

468
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,981
Yes. You should consider Lord Saya dead.

469
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,608
Then what will happen?

470
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,946
What if Commander Sodang comes
and says he never came?

471
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,074
The king couldn't have
found out everything, right?

472
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,204
Where is Elder Asa Nipa?

473
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,915
She's here. Would you like to meet her?

474
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,460
With Asa Pil and the ministers
of the Asa Clan.

475
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,422
Tonight.

476
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,510
Is the White Mountain Tribe

477
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,847
on my side?

478
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,765
Pardon, Your Highness?

479
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:42,228
Of course. The White Mountain Tribe
is helping you as per Asa Sakan's order.

480
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,147
Are the warriors

481
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,358
of the White Mountain Tribe
loyal enough to shed blood for me?

482
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,737
Is it not to that extent?

483
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,575
Asa Nipa.

484
00:33:56,242 --> 00:34:00,830
I don't know why you are asking,
but if the reward is clear,

485
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,167
and if you pay for the blood,

486
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,420
it wouldn't be impossible.

487
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,361
You dare abduct Agos on Ago land?

488
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,781
Are you insane?

489
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,409
Since when was this Ago land?

490
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,078
We occupied it

491
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,039
and Inaishingi declared it,
so it's the land of Ago!

492
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,540
Did Inaishingi declare it?

493
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,126
That's bullshit.

494
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,545
You dare insult Inaishingi?

495
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,715
- Yes.
- Damn it.

496
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,383
I, Karat, am good at insulting.

497
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,552
- You'd better get used to it.
- What?

498
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,429
Karat?

499
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,932
Both your name and that sword...

500
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,018
I can clearly tell
which tribe you're from.

501
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,853
Then there's no reason for us to do this.

502
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,230
You and us--

503
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,607
I'm not interested in
what those higher-ups do.

504
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,485
We didn't abduct Hae Kkadak
or whatever their name is.

505
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,569
We don't do that!

506
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:18,449
Really? Doesn't the Ago Tribe abduct
their own siblings and sell them off?

507
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,992
That was a long time ago.

508
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,995
Inaishingi put an end to it
when he was reincarnated!

509
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,914
We'll wait and see.

510
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:25,998
Here.

511
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,500
Eat up.

512
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,546
The fish smells.

513
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,759
Is the smell from your waterfall?

514
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,261
You bastard.

515
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,437
That guy was a very skilled bachi
even recognized

516
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,189
in the Bronze Workshop in Arthdal.

517
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,858
Really?
Yes.

518
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:56,529
Then do you think
he knows about iron swords too?

519
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,531
Arthdal made iron swords.

520
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,662
Right. Buksoe, listen to me carefully.

521
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,081
Iron swords are--

522
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,916
Arthdal did it.

523
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,335
They made iron swords.

524
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,297
Gosh, even Hae Kkadak couldn't do it
in the end.

525
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,425
Do you know about iron swords?

526
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,928
When you remove impurities from iron ore
and melt pure iron,

527
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,513
you can make incredible swords.

528
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,223
They're light, fast, and strong.

529
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,809
Hey, you.

530
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,186
Why did you change so much?

531
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,478
Why are you so smart?

532
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:34,233
Eunseom, hold onto him.
That is the only way.

533
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,652
You said he couldn't make
iron swords.

534
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,821
That's right, he can't. But...

535
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,702
Gosh, I shouldn't say this.

536
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,953
What is it?

537
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,206
Tell us quickly, you punk.

538
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,167
Well...

539
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,377
Gosh.

540
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:58,007
Arthdal made iron swords?

541
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,843
- Yes.
- Gosh.

542
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,512
Whoever it is, they're amazing.

543
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,934
But why are you telling me that?

544
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,894
I heard you could make one.

545
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,815
I cannot.

546
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,568
I can melt iron
and I've studied swords for a long time,

547
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,861
but there's no way...

548
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,073
to extract pure iron.

549
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,539
I heard there was a meteorite
made of pure iron.

550
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,170
But that is too rare.

551
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,673
It's very hard to find one,
and even if you do,

552
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,549
it would be too little.

553
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:47,014
I heard there was a huge meteorite
at the bottom of the Lake of Stars.

554
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,893
I shouldn't have trusted Buksoe.

555
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,479
That is none of your business.

556
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,941
Hae Kkadak, don't say that
and bet on Eunseom.

557
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,110
Yes. You need to stop them.

558
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,281
Them?

559
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,616
It's better for you not to know.

560
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,883
THE LAKE OF STARS

561
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,555
So there's a huge block of iron
at the bottom of the lake?

562
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:32,560
Yes. We found it before,
but there was no way to take it out.

563
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,729
Our lives depend on this.

564
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,772
We must find a way.

565
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,774
Let's check first.

566
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,486
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.

567
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,072
Even if it's deep,
I should be able to see it.

568
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,324
I'm a very good swimmer.

569
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,117
Don't fool around.

570
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,327
You punk.

571
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,205
Inaishingi, I'm going in.

572
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,219
Will Inaishingi come or not?

573
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,306
Of course he will.

574
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:14,310
You'll find out how absurd
your misunderstanding was.

575
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,438
The Ago Tribe is so funny.

576
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,691
You serve a dunce with unknown roots
as Inaishingi

577
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,653
and now you firmly believe in him.
What bullshit.

578
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,792
Why? Are you offended?

579
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,961
When this rope comes loose,

580
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,172
I'll pull out your tongue.

581
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,092
So keep talking.

582
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:47,843
Don't stop.

583
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:51,180
If Inaishingi doesn't show up,

584
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,474
I'm going to cut off your hand

585
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,601
and send it to him.

586
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,779
- He isn't coming out.
- It's been a while.

587
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,909
I'll go in.

588
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,042
Hey! Darn it.

589
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,837
Oh!

590
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,882
Is there something?

591
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,551
There is. I saw it.

592
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,011
But I couldn't even go near it.

593
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,474
Hey, you should've touched it
to find out what it was at least.

594
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,767
You go in then.

595
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,437
If I went near it,

596
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,605
I would've run out of breath and died.

597
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,359
Is the lake that deep?

598
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,404
We need to reach it
so we can use a net or tie it with a rope.

599
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,239
No, no, no. Impossible.

600
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,868
Sarams cannot hold their breaths
for that long. It's not like we're fish.

601
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,163
That's why
Hae Kkadak couldn't take it out either.

602
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,084
You must go now, Inaishingi.

603
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,880
There must be a way.
We'll think of one. Get going.

604
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,309
Did you jump in

605
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,561
because you were worried about me?

606
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,025
No. I felt a bit hot.

607
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,904
It's hot?

608
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,114
Isn't it cold now?

609
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,511
Stop there.

610
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,183
You really came.

611
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,103
Are you hurt?

612
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,188
No, we're fine.

613
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,273
We were careless.

614
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,360
I am sorry.

615
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,612
You have a sorry face.

616
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,410
Are you Inaishingi?

617
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,249
We did not abduct your brothers.

618
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,252
Brothers? I don't know them.

619
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,379
Who are you? Which tribe are you from?

620
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,880
Enough with the nonsense.

621
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,300
Send them here first.

622
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,763
After the trade, I'll kill that bastard.

623
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,014
We need

624
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,850
to get Hae Kkadak back.

625
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,769
Restrain yourself.

626
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,048
Thank you for accommodating us.

627
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,135
Forget what I said yesterday.

628
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:21,640
My nose was rotting
from the smell of your waterfall.

629
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,810
Hey, what are you blabbering on about?

630
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,535
Father!

631
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,786
Ttaemun, Ttaemun!

632
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,871
Follow him!

633
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,444
Help me!

634
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,583
Help me!

635
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,420
This way.

636
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:41,845
Help me.

637
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,264
Help me.

638
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,254
Dalsae, duck!

639
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,169
Drop your sword and tell us who you are.

640
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,838
You already saved your hostages.

641
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,090
He is

642
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,926
not your brother.

643
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,805
The person who's supposed to take him
is already dead too.

644
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:50,933
Let him go and leave.

645
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,602
We must bring him with us.

646
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,927
An Igutu.

647
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,769
No way.

648
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,729
He was definitely dead.

649
00:47:56,623 --> 00:48:00,502
I, Karat of Marugin,
have resolved my galma...

650
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,628
EVERYTHING TO REPAY

651
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,046
...so I return it to water.

652
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,974
Please accept it.

653
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:31,158
-  What are you looking at?
- Hold on.

654
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,826
Weren't you dead?

655
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,203
How were you alive in the water?

656
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,496
He's from the Momo Tribe.

657
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,252
The Momo Tribe?

658
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,340
Then you weren't dead.

659
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,050
As I was fighting,

660
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,093
I got tired,

661
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,220
so I took a rest.

662
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,805
He's Karat of the Momo Tribe.

663
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,308
And he is the Xabara's beogeumbari.

664
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,559
CHIEF OF THE MOMO TRIBE

665
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,810
HALF-BROTHER

666
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,565
Hey, I'll pull your tongue out
as promised.

667
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,485
What? Why?

668
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,529
Do you know what he said
after he tied us up? Darn it.

669
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,949
Please shut up, will you?

670
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,368
What is it?

671
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,536
Why are you doing this?

672
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,455
Damn it.

673
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,482
High Priest Niruha has arrived.

674
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,936
It is nice to gather together like this.

675
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,648
Since High Priest Niruha is here,

676
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,317
I have something to say first.

677
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,763
What's so funny, Your Majesty?

678
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,432
Is there something amusing?

679
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,642
I was talking about you.

680
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,686
About me?

681
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,771
That is right.

682
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,149
- Arok, come here.
- Yes, Father.

683
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,234
My Queen, have a seat too.

684
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:15,822
Arok. Do you know where Saya is?

685
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,492
He went to fight the Ago Tribe.

686
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:22,829
He did not.

687
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:26,708
It seems that your mother has killed Saya.

688
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,882
Am I wrong?

689
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:40,806
Everyone must've heard
that since that day,

690
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,683
the king took too much medicine
and his mind became cloudy.

691
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,936
So he says bizarre things once in a while.

692
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,771
Once,

693
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,942
he even killed three yakbachis.

694
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,363
Where is Saya?

695
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,658
Did you kill him
or did you lock him up somewhere?

696
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,035
Obviously, he left
to Molabeol Castle recently--

697
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,829
Not the fake one! The real one!

698
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,705
The real Saya!

699
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,091
What do you mean, "fake" and "real"?

700
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:20,178
You instigated the Children of Shahati
to kill Saya.

701
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,930
Asa Yon confessed everything.

702
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,056
Your Majesty.

703
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,016
Asa Yon has deep resentment against us.

704
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,018
He could say anything.

705
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:28,854
Arok.

706
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,148
Your father seems to be ill.

707
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,899
- Let's see him next time.
- Gilseon!

708
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,988
Bring him here.

709
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,376
Tell me what you did

710
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:54,171
in Hanchoa under whose orders.

711
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,922
Yes, Your Majesty.

712
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,136
The queen told me

713
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,555
to find someone
that looked like Lord Saya.

714
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,975
She told me to bring his body at least.

715
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,226
That's nonsense!

716
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,561
Did you want to kill Saya,

717
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,981
make his benetbeot act as him,

718
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,984
and make that fake give up
on his position as the heir

719
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:17,986
so that when Arok succeeded me,

720
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,906
you could try and kill me?

721
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,290
Mother.

722
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,708
Do you really not see

723
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,586
Asa Yon's lie and that dunce's trick?

724
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,795
Your Majesty.

725
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:41,009
Commander Sodang will return
from Molabeol soon.

726
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,845
It would be nice if he came with Saya.

727
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:44,971
But if he doesn't,

728
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:48,016
if Sodang says
Saya never went to Molabeol,

729
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:52,145
it'll be over for you, Your Highness.

730
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,023
So just go and wait.

731
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,951
I'll escort you to the Fortress of Fire.
Follow me.

732
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,829
I know where it is.

733
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,180
- Prince Arok.

734
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,155
It's hard to believe

735
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,075
that there is a fake general.

736
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,538
Is it so hard to believe?

737
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,179
Have you never heard
about Saya's benetbeot?

738
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,099
Answer me.

739
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,184
Have you heard of it or not?

740
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,023
I've never heard of it.

741
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:23,903
After you announced

742
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,365
that the blood of Aramun came to me,

743
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,200
I keep dreaming.

744
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,369
But not long ago,

745
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,705
as I was lying down in my bed,

746
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,792
Yangcha said this to Saya.

747
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,338
"This is Tanya Niruha's order."

748
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,298
"Get lost from Arthdal."

749
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,101
Was this a dream or reality?

750
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:58,855
Answer me
with your psychic ability of the gods!

751
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,944
Why? Can't you answer me?

752
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,864
Should I think about it however I like?

753
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,159
Your Majesty.

754
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,870
Why would I need the psychic ability

755
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,040
of the gods
to find out something like that?

756
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,042
Yangcha.

757
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,087
Did you meet the fake Saya

758
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,506
and say such things in the king's bedroom?

759
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,344
In the name of Airuju,
tell the king without any lie.

760
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,640
If there's anything else
you have hid from the king, tell him.

761
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,101
I command you in the name

762
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,770
of High Priest Asa Tanya,
the reincarnation of Asa Sin.

763
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,732
What are you doing?

764
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,859
The High Priest gave you a command.

765
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,611
Did you hide anything from me?

766
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,323
Did you say such things in my bedroom?

767
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,419
I have...

768
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,797
never done that.

769
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,341
I hid nothing.

770
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,514
Your Majesty.

771
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,810
I suppose it was just a dream.

772
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,206
Your Majesty, you are going too far!

773
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:45,503
I just cannot fathom what you are saying.

774
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,797
What is it about the general passing away?

775
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,215
And a fake general?

776
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,967
What is that now?

777
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,552
Continue.

778
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,305
I heard that dreams were like illusions.

779
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:58,349
In the past, they called it "gwitgeot."

780
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:02,061
Are you saying
I saw and heard a gwitgeot?

781
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:11,237
Or are you saying I am a gwitgeot?

782
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,199
Niruha has started a new world.

783
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:17,494
But are you still calling the dreams
dreamt by an Igutu

784
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,079
a dirty gwitgeot?

785
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,709
My King.

786
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,461
That's not what I mean.

787
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,962
It's the king's order.

788
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,633
I sentence Minister Chobal
to Daeyok Punishment!

789
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:34,886
PUNISHMENT OF COVERING ONE'S MOUTH
AND EYES AND DECAPITATING

790
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,889
Your Majesty.

791
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,642
You cannot use the banquet
to confine the queen

792
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,186
and give an order
to kill a minister who advised you.

793
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,063
Yes, I can.

794
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,315
I am the reincarnation of Aramun Haesulla.

795
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,816
I made you Aramun!

796
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,166
Since you appointed me,

797
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,502
dethrone me then.

798
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,179
I sentence Chobal to Daeyok Punishment.

799
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:24,894
Chobal, you will die,
unable to see the sky or make a sound.

800
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:26,938
Mungtae!

801
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,648
Yes, Your Majesty.

802
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,319
- Drag him out.
- Your Majesty.

803
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:37,073
Sanung Niruha saved my life.

804
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,755
The banquet is over!

805
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,271
Daeyok Punishment?

806
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:12,191
He sentenced a minister
to Daeyok Punishment just for that?

807
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,319
Yes, the rumor is true.

808
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:17,572
The king is not in his right mind.

809
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:21,242
What's with the fake general
and Lord Saya being killed?

810
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,287
Hey, where are you going now?

811
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,290
You're going to headbutt him again?
Bakryangpung, hold him!

812
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,587
Should I sit still
when the country's going down?

813
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,680
You are insane.

814
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,975
How could you make me do that?

815
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,853
Do you think my mind is yours
just because you can read it?

816
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,772
Do you find pranks like this funny?

817
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:54,942
Shall I

818
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,195
tell you a secret?

819
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:05,328
A huge secret nobody has heard
and I've never spoken out loud.

820
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,246
What is it?

821
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:08,706
I'm actually...

822
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,542
an ordinary person.

823
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:17,006
One who has psychic ability of the gods
that can listen to others' thoughts?

824
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,884
No. To me,

825
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:24,305
that is like an incurable disease.

826
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,725
Just because I accepted it
as the voice of God,

827
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,103
it doesn't mean the pain goes away.

828
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,730
Yangcha.

829
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,898
I'm just...

830
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,068
struggling.

831
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:43,366
One day, I received a mission,
and it's too much for me,

832
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,370
but I don't even have the courage
to run away like Asa Sin.

833
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,622
I'm just someone like that.

834
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:54,752
Regardless of what history you have
with Tagon and what situation you are in,

835
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,421
I'm lacking and in a rush

836
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,673
that I cannot even be considerate.

837
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,134
Is this a prank?

838
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,927
Is this funny?

839
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,596
No.

840
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:10,852
I just desperately
held on to you asking for help.

841
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:15,064
- Niruha.
- Please join my side.

842
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,367
MOLABEOL CASTLE

843
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:28,369
What do you mean?

844
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:29,954
Why did he suddenly summon us?

845
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,039
I'm just relaying
the king's message.

846
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,541
COMMANDER SODANG

847
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:37,670
Also, from now on, I will be responsible
for the front line of the Ago.

848
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:39,964
This is the king's order too.

849
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:44,927
General Saya and Commander Sodang,
you must return to Arthdal without delay.

850
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:53,936
If you go to Arthdal,
what would I do here alone?

851
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,856
You'll get a message.
Follow Eunseom's orders.

852
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:58,524
Gosh.

853
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,526
Excuse me.

854
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:03,321
Will the new commander listen to me?

855
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,037
Tell him it was my order.

856
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,540
Write down what you need in there.

857
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:18,127
I don't know if this is enough.

858
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:25,635
Tell Eunseom to conquer Molabeol Castle
no matter what.

859
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:31,057
I'll go back and conquer Arthdal Castle.

860
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:38,147
It's him.

861
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,192
He had it.

862
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:50,952
Ikomahis.

863
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:55,998
Don't get on his nerves
and do it sincerely.

864
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,626
How many times are you going to say that?
I get it.

865
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,379
Why did he make me do it?

866
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:02,839
Dachi.

867
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,215
This is a military command.

868
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,051
You're bringing up military command?
Cheap move.

869
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:08,636
Yes, ma'am.

870
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,849
Only the Momo Tribe can take out
that iron meteorite

871
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,351
and that Hae Tribe guy can make it
into swords.

872
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,562
We must not let go of any of them.

873
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,522
Bring the raspberry wine!

874
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,065
I'm coming.

875
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,116
I can assure you that he won't help us.

876
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,617
You've never dealt with him.

877
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:33,369
It's Inaishingi's order.

878
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,789
Until Ipsaeng comes back,
we must hold him here no matter what.

879
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:37,874
Gosh.

880
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:42,378
What did he order Ipsaeng?
Why did he go to Agoha Forest?

881
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,255
Goodness.

882
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,894
If you need anything,
feel free to let me know.

883
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,524
What are you plotting?
Why are you doing this to us?

884
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:05,860
What do you mean?

885
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,863
We just want you to rest well
until your wound is healed.

886
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,033
Then enjoy.

887
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,084
This is strange.

888
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:28,090
- Welcome.

889
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,175
Come in here.

890
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,428
Isn't there something
we need to talk about?

891
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,430
Yes, there is.

892
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:38,267
I resolved my galma
and am done with my business,

893
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,227
but you must have a lot of questions,

894
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:41,562
so I should tell you.

895
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:42,939
Before that,

896
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,858
why are you chasing after them?

897
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:49,445
My clan has a deep history with them too.

898
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,489
Gosh, what's the use of me knowing that?

899
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:55,076
But it's strange.

900
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:59,497
Why are these sly guys
treating us this way?

901
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,040
You aren't going to help them.

902
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,337
So they do want something from me.

903
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,006
Right? Of course I won't help them.

904
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:11,842
It's the best
for us Momo Tribe not to do anyone

905
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:13,511
any favors nor receive any.

906
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,555
That's all galma.
If I have galma, I need to repay it.

907
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:19,475
If I can't repay,
I can't go to the Land of Light.

908
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,602
Thinking about it alone is tiring.

909
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:24,063
- Gosh.
- If you help,

910
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:26,065
the history of the entire Arth continent

911
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,775
will change.

912
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:35,908
The history
of the entire Arth continent will change?

913
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:45,209
Then I must never help them.

914
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:49,255
I cannot form galma with the entire world.

915
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,161
Relay my words to Minister Asa Pil.

916
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,747
Then you will get ten times more.

917
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:23,998
You should give me more.

918
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:26,000
For example...

919
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,215
the whole of Arthdal?

920
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:36,469
What is this?

921
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,553
Who are you?

922
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:42,099
And isn't this Mihol's memento?

923
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:43,976
I see.

924
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,147
Since you killed him yourself,
it must not be very precious to you.

925
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,231
Saya?

926
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,567
Are you Saya?

927
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,735
Who else would it be?

928
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:53,903
What happened?

929
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,821
You were alive, but until now--

930
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:58,574
Aren't you being too shameless
when you tried to kill me?

931
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,284
Believe it or not,

932
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,953
I never tried to kill Arok.

933
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:05,664
I know...

934
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:08,167
that it was not you.

935
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,088
Did you try to kill me when you knew that?

936
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,672
Why?

937
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,301
Because you needed to kill me anyway?

938
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,805
No.

939
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:24,308
When I sent the Children of Shahati,
I really thought it was you.

940
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:26,936
Then?

941
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,396
I investigated the poison
that almost killed Arok.

942
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:33,567
But the Hae Tribe's bachis who knew about
more than 200 poisons

943
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,945
couldn't figure it out.

944
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,906
Then we finally figured it out.

945
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,993
That poisoned needle...

946
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,161
There was...

947
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,123
no poison.

948
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,752
We were trying to find poison,

949
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,338
but there was none,
so of course we couldn't.

950
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,716
Then that incident...

951
01:08:57,716 --> 01:08:58,801
It was Tagon.

952
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,888
He wanted to make me kill you
and kill me for that crime.

953
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,561
He almost succeeded.

954
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:13,524
So what will you do now?

955
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:14,608
I will attack Tagon.

956
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:17,403
Why?

957
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,405
Can you not forgive the king?

958
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,699
Tagon and I don't have
that kind of relationship.

959
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:25,161
- There's nothing to forgive.
- Then?

960
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:30,833
Something in me finally ended.

961
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:39,758
Do you want to listen to my plan?

962
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:44,346
If that plan consists
of you and I taking over Arthdal.

963
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:49,518
Kill Tagon and enthrone Arok.

964
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,605
You'll be the regent, of course.

965
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:55,566
What will you get?

966
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,194
Tanya.

967
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:00,529
I'm going to marry Tanya.

968
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,615
That is all I need.

969
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:04,700
That is all you need?

970
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:08,120
You don't expect me
to believe that, right?

971
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:11,999
In the end,

972
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,251
we might end up fighting.

973
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,213
I'll prepare too.

974
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:22,009
Sure. But until then,
we can work together.

975
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,552
Right?

976
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,604
Those that attacked Remus.

977
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,567
Are the records
in Pilgyeonggwan everything?

978
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,653
When Father helped Hae Kkadak run away,

979
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,780
he sent some with him.

980
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,823
What about it?

981
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,463
"Those with the shields
with finger patterns

982
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:01,966
wiped out Remus in an instant."

983
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:05,469
"In the place where they charged
shouting, 'Ikomahis,'

984
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,972
not one survived."

985
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:42,798
This is yours.

986
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:46,719
It has been
passed down in the family of Ragaz.

987
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:10,576
No way.

988
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,579
- What?
- Sodang is back,

989
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,247
and General Saya isn't dead.

990
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:16,623
They came together.

991
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:20,461
Where is Sodang?

992
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,262
Saya is here?

993
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:33,766
Yes. Not Eunseom, but Saya.

994
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,267
The real general is back.

995
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,331
What about my sister?

996
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,250
Where is she?

997
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,336
Don't worry. She is on her way.

998
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,755
Why didn't she come with you?

999
01:13:05,672 --> 01:13:08,050
- If you're fooling me--
Who is it?

1000
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:10,761
What brings you here?

1001
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:14,973
If anyone sees us together,
things will get messy.

1002
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:17,434
Go in there.

1003
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:18,852
I'll explain later.

1004
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,151
Who is it?

1005
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:27,277
Stop there!

1006
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:58,684
I have a question for you.

1007
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,646
How did you get that?

1008
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,608
What is your relationship with it?

1009
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:09,820
You came here for this?

1010
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:12,489
I guess this is very important.

1011
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:13,824
Where did you get it from?

1012
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:16,410
Before that,

1013
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:18,787
tell me what this is first.

1014
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:21,123
Did you steal it?

1015
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,666
Whose is it?

1016
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,626
Is it yours?

1017
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:25,878
If it is?

1018
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:29,047
If you are its owner, we must go together.

1019
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:32,468
If not, you must die.

1020
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:53,215
Who are these guys?

1021
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:57,386
I don't know.

1022
01:15:58,637 --> 01:15:59,846
They followed me here.

1023
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:02,808
I don't know why they did.

1024
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:05,102
Now tell me.

1025
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:08,772
If something happened to Chaeeun,

1026
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,275
you'll die.

1027
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,403
I shouldn't die.

1028
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,492
Our time has finally come.

1029
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,744
What do you mean?

1030
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,204
You'll take revenge.

1031
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:26,164
And I...

1032
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:28,375
will get Arthdal.

1033
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:30,836
We will...

1034
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,547
kill Tagon now.

1035
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:48,812
What I mean is...

1036
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,441
- I'll explain everything.
- Tell me your plan.

1037
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:55,152
How will you...

1038
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:58,405
take over Arthdal?

1039
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,996
The original plan we made with Mubaek.

1040
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:08,665
We'll kill Tagon,

1041
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:10,667
take down Taealha,

1042
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:13,211
and we,
the three children of the prophecy,

1043
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:15,589
will take over this world.

1044
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:55,712
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

1045
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:59,341
I sentence Yeonbal and Gitoha
to Daeyok Punishment.

1046
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,010
His madness is getting out of hand.

1047
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,553
We must not miss this timing.

1048
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:07,224
Can you really kill someone
whom you've wished for for so long?

1049
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,810
Because he was someone
I wished for in the past.

1050
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,895
See you again at this time
tomorrow night.

1051
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:13,271
In front of Tagon's corpse.

1052
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:16,358
The High Priest is with us too,
which gives us a lot of support.

1053
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:19,653
We benetbeot brothers
will make this land peaceful

1054
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:23,865
with the least amount of blood, for you.

1055
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,326
Only for you, Tanya.
