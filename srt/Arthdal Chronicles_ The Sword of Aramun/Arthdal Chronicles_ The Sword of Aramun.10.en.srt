1
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:49,966
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

2
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,011
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

3
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,388
The king knew everything.

4
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,973
If Tagon is dead...

5
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,517
Stop. Don't hurt Father.

6
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,519
Nunbyeol. It's a trap.

7
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,771
We need to run away.

8
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,440
- Drop the knife.
Let's escape for now.

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,193
Go to Eunseom. Go and give this to him.

10
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,986
Isn't your mother there?

11
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,321
Since when?

12
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,697
Thirty years.

13
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,657
Mother.

14
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,117
I will never die.

15
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,830
It has no smell. Is this bichwisan?

16
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,166
I guess there's no way
for me to live.

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,335
There's only one way
for you to live.

18
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,669
Kill Tanya.

19
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,090
The real one is coming. The real Aramun.

20
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,384
I might die here like this.

21
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,096
But you will die at my hands.

22
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,388
Saya is dead.

23
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,099
So my plans have changed.

24
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,935
I, Tagon, King of Arthdal,
will go to war myself.

25
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,937
Arthdal's army will pass the Arth Forest

26
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,022
and raid the South Gate
of Molabeol Castle.

27
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,943
All soldiers, retreat quietly.

28
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,195
It's an ambush.

29
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,614
All soldiers, retreat.
- Do not let Tagon escape.

30
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,157
Inaishingi. I think...

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,244
you guys have fallen into a trap.

32
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,220
Inaishingi!

33
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,434
Remember my face.

34
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,232
WHIRLWIND FIRE

35
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,154
I might die here like this.

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,283
But you will die at my hands.

37
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,034
Remember...

38
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,745
my face.

39
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,129
General?

40
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,798
TACHUKAN

41
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,883
Inaishingi, focus here.

42
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,637
Arthdal's king is over there!

43
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,224
- Kill him!
- Why did you come down here?

44
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,811
Your Majesty!

45
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,312
The name of the stranger
who became Inaishingi is Eunseom.

46
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,147
THE AGO TRIBE'S LEGENDARY HERO

47
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,357
He's a Wahan from Iark.

48
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,651
One day,
in the year of the singing wolf...

49
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,363
Sword, Bell, and Mirror appeared
in the world together.

50
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,073
He is Saya's benetbeot,

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,743
and a Wahan who was born
on the same day and time as Tanya Niruha.

52
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,936
You're fake.

53
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,729
No.

54
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,440
We are all fake.

55
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,110
You must've heard about

56
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,529
Inaishingi riding Kanmoreu.

57
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,581
It's not a legend.

58
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,083
The real one is coming.

59
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,502
The real Aramun.

60
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,343
Eunseom of the Wahan Tribe,
Saya's benetbeot,

61
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,056
and Inaishingi. All of them were you?

62
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,392
Also, I'll become the reincarnation
of Aramun Haesulla...

63
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,022
with Kanmoreu.

64
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,283
Retreat!

65
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,081
I'll deal with that bastard.

66
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,457
You retreat with the rest.

67
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,541
That's nonsense.

68
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,544
I'm not trying to save you.
Are you trying to get the others killed?

69
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,426
Retreat!

70
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,387
Retreat!

71
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,689
Your Majesty.

72
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,360
Stop! Face me!

73
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,113
Stop right there!

74
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,573
Your Majesty!
There's no need to chase them.

75
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,909
The armored infantry in the forest
will finish them.

76
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,953
I must chase after him. I must catch him!

77
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,079
You can't!

78
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,045
Do you know who he is?

79
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,338
- He is--
- I know!

80
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,423
COMMANDER YEONBAL

81
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,882
Inaishingi who rides Kanmoreu.

82
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,386
We cannot catch him.

83
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,470
I don't know why...

84
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,599
but that really is Kanmoreu.

85
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,978
No.

86
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,564
That isn't Kanmoreu.

87
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,858
No.

88
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,568
He's not Aramun!

89
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,654
I am. I am Aramun!

90
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:31,284
I, Gitoha, and everyone in the Third Corps

91
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,663
are not following you
because you're Aramun.

92
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,769
NORTHMOST OF THE ARTH CONTINENT

93
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,314
It's been about a week
since Tagon went to war.

94
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,566
The victor must've been decided.

95
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,027
It's hard for Eunseom to win.

96
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,488
He probably lost.

97
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,614
NUNBYEOL, CHAEEUN

98
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,991
It's not like
we were relying on them anyway.

99
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,452
I will find a way.

100
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,582
Nunbyeol.

101
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,418
To me, you're more important than revenge.

102
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,378
What about you?

103
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,130
Is revenge more important than me?

104
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,423
What do you mean?

105
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,467
I hate myself for acting so foolishly.

106
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,802
Why did I hesitate?

107
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,472
He's from the tribe
that killed our mother and father.

108
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,391
I'll never hesitate again.

109
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,476
I will...

110
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,520
kill all of them.

111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,814
I'm afraid I might lose you too.

112
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,151
What's wrong, Chaeeun? Don't do this.

113
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,447
I want you to leave with them.

114
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,907
Stop saying nonsense.

115
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,333
There's a long way
to go until the fox flowers blossom.

116
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,918
NEANTHAL

117
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,962
We need your help.

118
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,802
You're Nunbyeol?

119
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,513
I've heard a lot about you.

120
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,432
You came to us like this.

121
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,518
NEANTHAL

122
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,144
That's not why she's here.

123
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,272
Don't get excited.

124
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,568
What do you think I am thinking?

125
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,238
I just thought it was nice to see her.

126
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,116
Welcome.

127
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,451
Yes. Nice to meet you.

128
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,497
But the person
who came with you last time...

129
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,375
He left.

130
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,379
You know Rottip.

131
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:54,051
He said everything was meaningless
no matter what happened,

132
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,430
but this time, he even put some makeup
on his lips before he left.

133
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,390
You're very fluent in Arthdal language.

134
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:05,605
The person who saved my life
and raised me was from Arthdal.

135
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,233
But did something happen?

136
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,361
- Why did Rottip leave?

137
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:16,824
It is said
that long ago, hundreds of winters ago,

138
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,869
there were brothers who got separated.

139
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,748
I think they're back.

140
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,791
Then isn't that a good thing?

141
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:31,088
Is it related to the strange Igutus
we met that day?

142
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:35,092
I think Rottip went to find out.

143
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,678
Who did he go to meet?

144
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,556
The person who knows that...

145
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,643
is probably...

146
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,528
NEANTHAL

147
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,992
We won. We won.

148
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,077
The Arthdal army

149
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,954
defeated the Ago Tribe
in the first Arth Forest battle.

150
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,207
- I knew it.

151
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,126
Did they catch Inaishingi?

152
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,211
SEUCHEON - GEOMBUL

153
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,171
They weren't able to.

154
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:16,092
Anyway, all of the Ago Tribe ran away
to the Achi Hill.

155
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:21,138
If they're on the Achi Hill,
it's not over yet.

156
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,015
It means they're in the Arth Forest.

157
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,476
Gosh, I'm glad.

158
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,521
I was worried
because they were right in front of us.

159
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,109
What's there to worry about
when King Tagon went to war himself?

160
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,694
What I'm actually worried about

161
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:40,366
is that it has been many days
since High Priest Niruha came for relief.

162
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,662
What are you doing there?

163
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,622
What are you talking about?

164
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,127
Let's go.

165
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,213
Let's go.

166
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,799
What's that?

167
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,635
Kids must've scribbled on the wall.

168
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,554
The drawings are pretty good.

169
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,891
This looks like baby Aramun Haesulla.

170
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,268
Yes.

171
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,438
It's about
how baby Aramun Haesulla met Kanmoreu.

172
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,690
LEGENDARY HORSE
THAT ARAMUN HAESULLA RODE

173
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,692
But who's this baby?

174
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,110
Why are there two of them?

175
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,987
Is Aramun a benetbeot?

176
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,072
TWIN

177
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,533
That's how children's drawings are.

178
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,617
Kids, let's go.

179
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,745
Let's go.

180
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,254
Let's go.

181
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,223
There's stir-fried sorghum
in the backyard. Have some.

182
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,433
Okay.
- Go ahead.

183
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,700
You're bold to have come here.

184
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,923
Those children...

185
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,928
How terrible.

186
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,764
I thought
you weren't interested in what happens.

187
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,694
What's this? How ominous.

188
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,448
I think they're here.

189
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,036
How incredible.

190
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,247
I thought you had

191
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,792
no emotions or feelings.

192
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,546
How can I get rid of others' emotions
without any myself?

193
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:05,678
To dry up, crush, and completely remove
the feelings of fear, joy, and sadness,

194
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,763
I must know

195
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,558
what those emotions are.

196
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,310
That is why

197
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,230
you're the worst gosal...

198
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,314
REVENGEFUL SPIRIT

199
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,649
...in this world.

200
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,818
Shahati.

201
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,156
I thought nobody knew who Shahati was.

202
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,951
That's probably true for Sarams.

203
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,998
But she has had
a very ill-fated history with us

204
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,667
for a long time.

205
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,462
When the Asa Clan first came to this land,

206
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,882
we were already here.

207
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:50,055
Sarams wanted to drive us out,

208
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:56,103
but they couldn't
because they were too afraid of us.

209
00:14:56,103 --> 00:15:00,524
That's why she created beings
that know no fear.

210
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,528
That is how
the Children of Shahati started.

211
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:10,034
And that Shahati knows something
about those strange Igutus?

212
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,120
If they are related to our brother

213
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,207
who left a long time ago, she might.

214
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,253
That brother left
saying he would take revenge

215
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,214
on Shahati one day.

216
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:29,178
By any chance,
do you know what "Ikomahis" means?

217
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,139
"Ikomu," promise.

218
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,726
"Ahis," brother.

219
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,770
"Brother of promise."

220
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,648
It's our old language.

221
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,452
NEANTHAL

222
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,541
Someone had this.

223
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,836
If it is truly that of the legend,

224
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,171
we must find it and check.

225
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,637
Brother of promise?

226
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,725
GAMBAL MOUNTAIN COTTAGE

227
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,018
Lord Saya.

228
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,956
HAE YEOBI

229
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,212
Drink this.

230
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,882
You must drink this
to live without any aftereffects.

231
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,889
You've been sleeping for a long time.
Hurry up and drink.

232
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,112
How am I...

233
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,990
alive?

234
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,660
I definitely drank bichwisan.

235
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,163
It wasn't bichwisan, it was mahasin.

236
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,790
DRUG THAT MAKES YOU LOOK DEAD
FOR A SPECIFIC DURATION

237
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:26,712
Tagon must've taken the queen's mahasin
thinking it was bichwisan.

238
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,672
Then what about Taealha?

239
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,010
She's still alive, but she's confined.

240
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,511
Her original plan

241
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,475
was to drink mahasin if she failed,
and escape to the White Peak Mountain.

242
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,811
That's why...

243
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,064
Asa Pil wasn't around.

244
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,275
She must've sent Asa Pil to the mountain.

245
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,737
What about Tanya?

246
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,158
- Is Tanya safe?
- She's confined in the Great Shrine.

247
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,495
So...

248
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,164
that's how they ended up.

249
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,294
After the king left for the war,
Gilseon is in charge of Arthdal.

250
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,378
So...

251
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,922
He went to war?

252
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,882
The Ago Tribe took over Molabeol Castle,

253
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,426
and there seems to have been a battle
in Arth Forest.

254
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,636
The Arth Forest?

255
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,306
With a fast horse,
it would take one to two days.

256
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,974
For the first battle, Arthdal won.

257
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,019
The Ago army is isolated in the Achi Hill
and is confronting them

258
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,524
It will take time,
but it will be over soon.

259
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,984
It probably will.

260
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,095
How did the war go? Did we win or lose?

261
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,721
What about Tagon? Is he safe?

262
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,848
Pardon?

263
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,391
Well...

264
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,131
Eunseom hasn't been captured,
but everyone says the fight is over.

265
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,102
From Doti...

266
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,187
MOA

267
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,362
People can recognize baby Aramun
just from the drawings.

268
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,117
Is that so?

269
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,204
I wonder how far
the Whisper Organization has spread.

270
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,788
I'm not sure.

271
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,540
About 50 people?

272
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,710
Or it could be 100 people.

273
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,547
I also can't wait to find out
how far your thoughts have traveled.

274
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,925
Is the queen still confined?

275
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,760
Yes, Niruha.

276
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,595
They are keeping it quiet,
but everyone knows.

277
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,099
Are you curious about Aramun's next story?

278
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,226
Of course.

279
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,150
The first descendant of Asa Sin

280
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,985
to the second descendant of Asa Sin.

281
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,785
AGAJI

282
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,292
Isn't this about Eunseom?

283
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,127
THE WAHAN TRIBE, SCRIBE - YEOLSON

284
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,212
It is.

285
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,672
MUNGTAE

286
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,215
This is the Great Black Cliff,

287
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,967
this is the Lonicera Flower Forest,

288
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,551
and this...

289
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,929
Isn't this that horse?

290
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,473
I think so.

291
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,849
Why is something like this...

292
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,310
happening now?

293
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,021
Pretend you don't know.
We don't know anything.

294
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,983
Yeolson. Yeolson.

295
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,597
I really don't understand.

296
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,682
BAKRYANGPUNG

297
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,268
You aren't dragging me
to the military division

298
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,644
nor are you letting me go.

299
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,439
What do you want?

300
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,156
It's Aramun Haesulla.

301
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,491
- Is it his birth story?
- Bakryangpung.

302
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,204
Didn't you try
to find the real Aramun Haesulla?

303
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,582
Of course. Because Tagon...

304
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,834
is fake.

305
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:20,630
That was why Mubaek, Lord Saya,
and Niruha tried to dethrone Tagon.

306
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,799
If the true reincarnation of Aramun...

307
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,510
is Inaishingi...

308
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,263
will you be able to accept that?

309
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,727
Just kill me. Kill me!

310
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,811
TACHUKAN

311
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,606
Even if you tear my body

312
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,359
into nine pieces
and feed them to the fish,

313
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,986
it will not make me open my mouth.

314
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,239
You lot will be cursed by the waterfall.

315
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,492
Your limbs will become fins...

316
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,576
TAE DACHI

317
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,788
your skin will rot
and become food for maggots!

318
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,081
Just kill me!

319
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,171
You will not find out anything from us.

320
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,298
We have nothing to find out.

321
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,134
We have nothing, you idiot.

322
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,137
Your Ago Tribe is isolated
on the Achi Hill.

323
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:12,140
All supplies have been cut off
and they're totally surrounded.

324
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,520
Crushing the Ago Tribe
and catching Inaishingi?

325
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,188
That's going to be a breeze.

326
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,273
Then why are you keeping us alive?

327
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,651
The king seems to have a use for you.

328
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,741
That's enough.

329
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,618
Don't waste your energy.

330
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,702
Okay?

331
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,040
Right.

332
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,252
You were pretty good with your sword.

333
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,421
Yes.

334
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,385
Your Majesty.

335
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,638
We blocked off the way back to Molabeol
as per your orders.

336
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,640
Now, the Ago Tribe is like a bug

337
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,892
that won't even leave a trace
when stepped on.

338
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,769
- So--
- The soldiers saw it too, right?

339
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,480
Eunseom's face.

340
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,944
I told them they were a benetbeot.

341
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,989
I told them the general
and Inaishingi worked together

342
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,615
to start the rebellion...

343
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,743
and fooled the king and all of us.

344
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,954
They weren't very shaken.

345
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,038
Is it...

346
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,375
really Kanmoreu?

347
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,627
Why do you need...

348
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,214
something like Kanmoreu?

349
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,346
I'm the reincarnation of Aramun.

350
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,765
Why wouldn't I need it?

351
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,730
Why did you name this sword
the Sword of Seed?

352
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,901
Because it is the beginning
of destruction, slaughter,

353
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,820
and great prosperity.

354
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,905
So I dared to hope

355
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,283
that it would be the beginning
of the name, Tagon,

356
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,577
instead of the reincarnation...

357
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,874
of an old legend...

358
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,502
for you.

359
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,172
Forgive me.

360
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,840
I crossed the line.

361
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,030
Hey, Yeonbal.

362
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,449
How is the king?

363
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,537
He will overcome it.

364
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,916
So what you saw last time was true.

365
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,753
You said you saw a slave
who looked just like the general.

366
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:51,132
But how did he become Inaishingi?
I'm disappointed in Airuju.

367
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,634
THE HIGHEST GOD OF ARTH

368
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,678
How could he send Kanmoreu to Inaishingi?

369
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,431
No. We can take him back.

370
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,101
Yes. Hey.

371
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,602
Let's ask him to attack now.

372
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,522
What's the use of
just surrounding them all day?

373
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,941
The path to get in there is too narrow

374
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,278
for a large army to attack at once.

375
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,573
We need to find a way
to make them crawl out.

376
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,325
Our damage will increase.

377
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,453
Yes, the damage on our side would be huge.

378
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,664
But we won't lose!

379
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:35,969
How did it go?

380
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,470
It's almost done.

381
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,181
You must've worked really hard. Good job.

382
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,183
I'm thinking hard about

383
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:46,605
how we should let Ago know about this.

384
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,901
We are completely surrounded indeed.

385
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,698
The path back to Molabeol
has the most soldiers.

386
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,744
More than 40% of our soldiers
are dead or unable to fight.

387
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,828
Tachukan and Dachi

388
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,080
have either been caught...

389
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,625
or are dead.

390
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,669
Arthdal has
three times more soldiers than us.

391
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,754
IPSAENG

392
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,714
But we can't keep doing this
without supplies.

393
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,716
We must put an end to this.

394
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,385
- Time isn't on our side.
- Nor is it on their side.

395
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,432
Inaishingi. Arthdal sent a messenger.

396
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,744
I remember when I first saw you.

397
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,579
Yes, it was in Doldambul.

398
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,623
You were a slave.

399
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,957
How do I look?

400
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,628
Do I look exactly like your general?

401
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,879
Our general?

402
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,757
He's a traitor now.

403
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,551
Both you and him are Arthdal's enemies.

404
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,637
Are we the only ones?

405
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,974
Everyone in this continent,
excluding Arthdal, is your enemy.

406
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,603
We cut off all waterways to the Achi Hill.

407
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:14,150
You'll notice it in a few days, but he
told me to inform you first as a courtesy.

408
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,197
So, do you want us to surrender?

409
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,451
We, Ago, are the warriors of forests.

410
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,162
Can warriors of forests live
without water?

411
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,582
Sucking tree sap and drinking dew?

412
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,962
As each day passes,
you will become weaker by the day,

413
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,589
and after ten days,
you will become much weaker,

414
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,758
regardless of what you are.

415
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,929
Are you here to see
how much I can endure it?

416
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,724
If that's your aim,
my answer is beheading you

417
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,892
and sending your head to Tagon.

418
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,437
King Tagon wishes to meet you.

419
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:56,192
Tomorrow at sunset, he wishes to meet you
without any troops, except two escorts...

420
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,862
on both sides.

421
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,907
He wants something from us.

422
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,161
That is why he cut off the waterways.

423
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,495
Yes.

424
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,206
What will you do?

425
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,388
There's no doubt.

426
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,643
You look so alike.

427
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,727
Don't tell me

428
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,564
you were still doubting
that Saya and I are brothers.

429
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,982
I'm not talking about Saya.

430
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,319
Ragaz.

431
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,697
The Neanthal who died
during the Great Hunt.

432
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,741
Ragaz, the Great Hunter.

433
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,702
He fought really well.

434
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,497
He terrorized us until the day he died,

435
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,751
and many countless Daekan comrades died
because of him.

436
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,129
What about that Neanthal?

437
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,299
He is you and Saya's...

438
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,802
father.

439
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,139
He is...

440
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,517
my father?

441
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,937
He was a great warrior.

442
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,605
Much better than you.

443
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,319
What happened to him?

444
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,490
I...

445
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,160
I...

446
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,038
shot his neck with an arrow.

447
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,585
Dozens of Daekan warriors
rushed to him immediately

448
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,545
and hacked at him with all their might.

449
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:25,341
Clear blue blood spewed out
like a waterfall.

450
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:30,054
It's vivid
although it happened a long time ago.

451
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,895
It was unspeakably miserable.

452
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,443
Still...

453
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,033
I'm sure it wasn't as miserable a death
as your father, Sanung,

454
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,410
who was killed by his own son.

455
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,830
Since you witnessed both, think about it.

456
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,333
Whose death was more miserable?

457
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,919
At the moment of their deaths,

458
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,379
who do you think felt...

459
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,090
more terrible?

460
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,517
You're trying to become Aramun Haesulla?

461
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,144
I'm not trying to.

462
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,773
- I will become it.
- That's what I thought too.

463
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,775
No, I'm different from you.

464
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,318
What's different?

465
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,905
You want to become something,
but I want to do something.

466
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,909
You do something to become Aramun,

467
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,746
but I want to become Aramun
to do something.

468
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,124
What is that something?

469
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,794
A world where being weak isn't a sin.

470
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,838
The world
where being powerless isn't a sin.

471
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,425
That kind of world won't happen
even after 10,000 years.

472
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,510
But I'll keep going.

473
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,220
What's important is the direction.

474
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,808
Your goal ends with your death.

475
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,892
But the path I take...

476
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,895
will stretch endlessly beyond my death.

477
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,490
Fighting with you
even after your death sounds horrible.

478
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,785
So try to live.

479
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,037
I'll open the path for you to survive.

480
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,125
- You will?
- I'll clear the troops in front

481
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,461
of the Pine Tree Forest
at the north of the Achi Hill.

482
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,672
When my soldiers withdraw,

483
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,883
come out of there
and retreat to Molabeol Castle.

484
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,635
Let's decide the victor after that.

485
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,053
You think I'll believe that?

486
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,097
I hope you're different from Saya.

487
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,809
I showed Saya the way to live too.

488
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,062
I told him I would let him live
if he killed Tanya.

489
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,523
Since I raised Saya differently,

490
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,151
I thought he'd be different
from you and your father,

491
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,777
but in the end, he was the same.

492
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,821
I guess you can't fool blood.

493
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,242
Saya chose death without hesitation.

494
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,078
What about you?

495
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,455
Will you be any different?

496
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,081
Stop with your nonsense.

497
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,834
What do you want from us?

498
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,419
Hand over Suhana...

499
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,216
and Kanmoreu.

500
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,014
Then I will open up the way.

501
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,849
And Tachukan and Dachi?

502
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,477
I'll hand over your subordinates too.

503
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,561
They're alive?

504
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,940
Do you want to keep the name
of the reincarnation of Aramun that badly?

505
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,654
Do you think you'll become the owner
of that name just by having Kanmoreu?

506
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,907
You don't know anything!

507
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,535
You have no idea

508
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:43,664
what that name means to me
or how many people I have killed,

509
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:47,710
and what kind of blood I've shed
for that one name!

510
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,507
You're just trying to pick the name
off someone and make it your own,

511
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,343
so you cannot say that.

512
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,806
You are...

513
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,559
tightly bound to that name.

514
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,353
How pitiful.

515
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,979
Two days later.

516
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,023
Here, before the sun sets.

517
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,778
If you have any other choice, try it.

518
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,750
So they are alive.

519
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,210
Tachukan and Dachi.

520
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,672
Suhana, that yeomari, is one thing,

521
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:36,259
but handing over the horse of the heavens
is strategically...

522
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,846
Our warriors will be demoralized too.

523
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:43,141
Then should we just let them die
when we know they're alive?

524
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,768
If Tachukan discovers
he was exchanged with the horse,

525
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,228
he'll try to kill himself.

526
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,312
That's not the issue.

527
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,398
He said he'd open up the path to Molabeol.

528
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,316
Can we trust him or not?

529
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,403
I mean, must he go this far for the horse?

530
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,529
DALSAE

531
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,322
Because he's crazy over Aramun.

532
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,116
Even I believe that.

533
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,535
So the horse of the heavens
is Kanmoreu, right?

534
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,203
And that is the symbol of Aramun.

535
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,955
Why are you silent?

536
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,251
Karat.

537
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,669
That bastard said this once.

538
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,672
The one who blocks flowing water...

539
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,758
will be eternally unfortunate.

540
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,805
Who? Tagon?

541
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,473
Is it?

542
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,643
It's not like I want to believe him.

543
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,604
Damn it.

544
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,772
ARTHDAL PALACE

545
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,608
It's not a big deal.

546
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,695
The queen must be getting a massage
from that servant.

547
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,779
JEUNGSUGAE

548
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,198
I'm saying this as that servant...

549
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,282
ROYAL GUARD HEAD GILSEON

550
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,451
...went in yesterday
and hasn't come out until now.

551
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,871
A guard who went in today morning
hasn't come out either.

552
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,456
A guard?

553
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,540
Yes.

554
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,585
- The door is locked from the inside.
- If he was a guard...

555
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,794
CHOJAHA

556
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,088
...he must've gone in with a sword.

557
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:59,717
The queen can subdue a guard easily
without a sword.

558
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,596
Still, it's impossible to escape
from the rooftop prison.

559
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:08,559
There are soldiers on each staircase,
and many are guarding the doors too.

560
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:13,773
What if she wasn't planning to escape
but commit suicide?

561
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,736
The queen has already tried
to take bichwisan once.

562
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,910
The queen's swordsmanship
is better than most commanders.

563
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,120
Everyone, be alert and put your guards up.

564
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,705
- Yes, sir!
Start.

565
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,650
She's still alive.

566
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,235
Move her quickly. Now!

567
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,696
Hurry up and inform the yakbachis too.

568
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,822
DOCTOR

569
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,463
Be careful.

570
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,263
I must tear her clothes to see the wound.

571
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,806
Everyone, leave.

572
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,225
Still, I cannot leave her alone.

573
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,393
You two, stay.

574
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,520
Yes, sir.

575
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,489
If the queen dies,
we'll be held accountable.

576
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,366
Don't even say that.

577
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,827
That will never happen.

578
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,180
Who are you?

579
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,099
You knew that I was fine.

580
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,893
But why?

581
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,229
High Priest Niruha
wishes for you to escape.

582
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,814
Tanya?

583
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,525
Things went well
because you made the first move.

584
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,321
We were actually planning
to do something tonight.

585
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,993
- Who are you?
- We are just descendants of Asa Sin.

586
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,828
ARTHDAL'S LEGENDARY SACRED MOTHER

587
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,205
You, slaves, and I alike.

588
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:39,001
- What?
- Niruha said names are what bind us.

589
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,588
I am also bound by many names,
but for now,

590
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:48,719
I'll help you under the name
of the 938th descendant of Asa Sin.

591
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,310
How did it go?

592
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,646
She's still alive.

593
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,648
But we can't be sure.

594
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,359
If something really happens, we'll all...

595
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,443
We'll all what?

596
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,613
I mean, the queen
is the Royal Guard's responsibility.

597
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,407
Is that what's important right now?

598
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,450
That's the truth.

599
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,663
The queen has escaped.

600
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,137
This is terrible.

601
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,932
It went according to your order.

602
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,726
The queen has escaped.

603
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,687
It's a mess outside, Niruha.

604
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,565
It worked. Did she leave Arthdal?

605
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,987
I don't think she's left the castle,
but it seems she hasn't been caught.

606
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,323
Niruha, what are you trying to do?

607
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,950
Why did you help the queen?

608
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,412
The queen will try to leave Arthdal
and go to the White Peak Mountain.

609
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,497
That must've been her original plan.

610
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:03,627
Yes, so you should escape
before the king returns too.

611
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,554
DOTI

612
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,265
Doti, how did you come here?

613
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,809
I barely made it here after you called me.

614
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:23,647
I told you to take over the hearts
of a few people and treat them well.

615
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,691
I'm communicating with them as you said.

616
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,944
Among them,
pick three people who are most faithful.

617
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,031
- Then...
I will pick

618
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,493
three people who are currently
the pillars of Arthdal.

619
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,952
Niruha.

620
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,079
What do you mean?

621
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,626
In this Arthdal, where Tagon is at war
and Taealha has left,

622
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,086
if we knock down those three pillars,

623
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:47,880
Arthdal...

624
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,466
will collapse.

625
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,892
Let's go, Your Highness.

626
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,187
This must be Tanya, right?

627
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,359
Probably.

628
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,695
Can you tell what Tanya is trying to do?

629
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,239
I don't know what it is,

630
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,200
but since she's alive,
she's doing something.

631
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,370
We should do something too.

632
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,542
What about Saya?

633
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,751
He is recovering.

634
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:59,159
I'm back.
It was just like you said, Inaishingi.

635
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,122
What is it?

636
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:07,751
From here to all the way here
is the Pine Tree Forest.

637
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,754
But the trees are wounded
and resin is flowing out.

638
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,506
Someone did that on purpose.

639
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,466
What?

640
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,385
What's that? What is wrong with that?

641
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,470
Tagon...

642
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,682
has no intention of
clearing the way for us.

643
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,772
This is where we will exchange captives.

644
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,108
This is the path Tagon said he'd clear.

645
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,360
So?

646
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,614
It's a northeast wind.

647
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,115
Moreover, with resin,

648
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,869
imagine how easily
they would catch on fire.

649
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,663
Fire attack.

650
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,707
Is that what you mean?

651
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,962
Tagon must be planning to drive us
into the Pine Tree Forest

652
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,673
and annihilate us in a sea of fire.

653
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,758
Bastard.

654
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,844
And the time he wanted to meet
happened to be during the sunset.

655
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,929
That's right.

656
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:04,600
When the sun sets here,
the northeast wind gets stronger.

657
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,145
We have no choice.
Let's fight them head-on towards Molabeol.

658
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,938
We've already lost
half of our troops.

659
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,191
Arthdal has three times
more soldiers than us.

660
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,486
Why not attack them with fire first?

661
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,279
We're facing the wind.

662
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,283
How can we attack with fire
when we are the ones facing the wind?

663
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:25,954
No, we can, as long as we lure them
to the direction of the wind.

664
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:27,998
But how?

665
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,668
They already know the wind's direction
for the attack.

666
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,378
They won't come to its direction.

667
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,129
It's impossible.

668
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,339
Then what is possible?

669
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,467
Should we just suck the tree sap,
endure it, and die?

670
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,428
Here. The Amdol Mountain,
the north of the Achi Hill.

671
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,973
They must have have less soldiers here.
Why don't we escape through here?

672
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,643
We may be good at getting around
mountains and forests,

673
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,562
but there's no way
we can go through it with a huge army.

674
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,856
This place is surrounded with cliffs.

675
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,401
Not exactly cliffs.

676
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,361
They're very steep slopes.

677
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,613
Not everyone can hike like you.

678
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,715
Inaishingi, I brought her.

679
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,766
What are you going to do with me now?

680
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,270
Wherever you are,

681
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,480
wherever you go,

682
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,399
come back to me,

683
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,359
Helper.

684
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,738
Inaishingi, I...

685
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,947
Tagon...

686
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,493
wants you.

687
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,165
He said he would open up a path
if I handed you and Helper over.

688
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,751
What's your relationship with Tagon?

689
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,462
Is it so deep that...

690
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,799
the king looks after you himself?

691
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,264
A very long time ago,

692
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,185
we met when King Tagon was very young.

693
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,730
I served a danggeuri
of the Saenyeok Tribe.

694
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,064
SHAMAN

695
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:19,193
And Sanung hid Tagon, an Igutu, there.

696
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,528
We grew up together.

697
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:27,326
Then there was someone I secretly dated...

698
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,079
and he saw Tagon's purple blood.

699
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,375
The danggeuri had to kill everyone

700
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,337
because my lover was
from the White Mountain Tribe,

701
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,756
and if it became known,
it would have been over.

702
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,132
So did you run away?

703
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,134
Yes, with Tagon too.

704
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,888
Because the danggeuri
tried to kill Tagon too.

705
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,225
My lover...

706
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,353
saved both of us and died.

707
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,189
No, he saved three.

708
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,360
The baby in my womb.

709
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,905
Yangcha.

710
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,282
After that,
there were a lot more ups and downs.

711
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:11,703
Tagon saved Yangcha
who was taken by Shahati.

712
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,874
He saved my life as well.

713
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,299
I guess even Tagon...

714
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,095
doesn't want to sacrifice
his precious ones.

715
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,061
Do you need to sacrifice someone...

716
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,106
in this battle?

717
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,692
In the end, the name, Inaishingi...

718
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,905
is the price you need to pay
by sacrificing your precious ones

719
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,158
because you need
to protect a lot more people.

720
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:52,870
It must be dreadful.

721
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,457
But you must endure it in your place.

722
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,878
- Tagon as well--
- Stop.

723
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,633
You're not my advisor anymore.

724
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,224
That's the way to death.

725
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,019
If the land gets hot in this season,

726
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,104
a huge whirlwind fire might start.

727
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,272
What? Whirlwind fire?

728
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,108
- What's that now?
-  What should I say?

729
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,695
You'll know when you see it.
It's extremely disastrous.

730
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,705
Dalsae, who wants
to attack with fire first.

731
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,376
Mirusol, who says we can't attack
with fire facing the wind.

732
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,380
Tae Maja, who wants to lure them
to the direction of the wind.

733
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,676
Ipsaeng, who says there is no way
to lure them.

734
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,349
Everyone is right.

735
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,726
So I'll follow everyone's opinion.

736
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,479
What do you mean?

737
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,189
If we cannot lure the enemies...

738
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:07,778
nor change the direction of the wind,
there's only one thing we can change.

739
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,118
Our location.

740
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:16,954
Inaishingi.

741
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,998
If an army crosses the Amdol Mountain,
they will find out soon.

742
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:23,043
They'll attack us from both sides
at the end of the mountain.

743
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,628
Not a big army. A small group.

744
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:28,465
A small number of elites will set fire
at the back of the enemies.

745
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,096
We'll attack with fire
from the other side.

746
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:42,104
If we can set fire
behind the enemies' backs,

747
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,106
they'll be in the direction of the wind.

748
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,191
If we succeed,

749
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,027
where they are
will become the sea of fire.

750
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,489
They'll be the ones...

751
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,492
to face the whirlwind fire.

752
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,957
Of course, it could fail.

753
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,792
Even if it succeeds,

754
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,461
the lives of the warriors
who go to the back

755
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:08,880
won't be guaranteed.

756
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,346
Will you do it?

757
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,561
Cross the mountain before the sun rises,
ambush the enemies from behind,

758
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,188
and wait for the northeast wind.

759
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:12,277
Whether you succeed or fail,
we cannot send a rescue force.

760
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,945
AMDOL MOUNTAIN

761
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,640
ARTH FOREST, SOUTH

762
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:41,945
You made the wise choice.

763
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:45,156
I'll have to see the results first
to know that.

764
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,992
Send Kanmoreu here first.

765
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,660
I will send Tachukan.

766
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,371
Inaishingi.

767
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,165
How can you hand over
the horse of heavens to save us?

768
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,418
Stop it. You shouldn't.

769
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,378
I'll just die.

770
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:03,258
You have a subordinate who's willing
to die for you.

771
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,051
You must be happy.

772
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,388
Does it make you happy?

773
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:15,979
Both Suhana over there and Tachukan

774
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:20,025
are willing to die for you and me.

775
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:26,656
Does that...

776
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,575
really make you happy?

777
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,328
I see.

778
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:36,082
That's why you made it to that place.

779
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,587
It's painful.

780
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,924
It's excruciatingly painful
that I'll curse everything I have.

781
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:49,554
But showing that pain...

782
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,223
is cowardly.

783
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:58,813
I sacrifice them willingly,
confidently, and ruthlessly,

784
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,733
no matter what pain I feel alone.

785
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,242
ARTH FOREST, NORTH,
THE REAR OF ARTHDAL TROOPS' CAMP

786
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:39,854
What?

787
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,902
Ago's ambushing us!

788
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:48,405
What is it?

789
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,951
Everyone, hurry up!

790
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,747
Over there!

791
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,634
Is this really Kanmoreu?

792
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,511
Why?

793
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,306
Do you really feel like
you've become Aramun?

794
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,183
Aramun?

795
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:03,271
I told you, when we met in Arthdal,

796
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:09,486
that everyone is acting in front of us
and that you should not trust anyone.

797
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,406
I said everyone. Everyone!

798
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,868
Did you think I didn't count?

799
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,090
Helper!

800
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,511
You believed your enemy
like a fool!

801
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,597
Did I look like I was crazy over Aramun?

802
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,765
Aramun!

803
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,642
I don't need stuff like that.

804
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,061
I was bound by that name
and wandered for too long.

805
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,896
I am Tagon!

806
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,774
There was nothing else
to add to this name.

807
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,694
I will break off that chain today.

808
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:57,075
Don't be surprised.

809
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:01,329
All of you will die together today.

810
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,165
Tagon!

811
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,292
Send Dachi here!

812
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,545
I'll kill her!

813
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,137
Sister.

814
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,108
Your Majesty.

815
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:32,902
I'm sorry.

816
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:38,658
In the name of Inaishingi!

817
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,660
Stop, Tagon!

818
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,567
Cover me!

819
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,236
Cover me!

820
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,030
Get that bastard!

821
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,617
Shit!

822
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:03,701
Stop there!

823
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,714
Your Majesty, you shouldn't!

824
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,139
Your Majesty, we should leave.

825
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:29,977
Tagon!

826
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,562
Inaishingi.

827
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,272
We must leave.

828
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,188
Stop them! We must stop them!

829
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:33,166
Great warriors of Arthdal.

830
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,959
We will drive the beasts of Ago

831
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:38,379
into the northern Pine Tree Forest,
set fire to it,

832
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,882
and offer them to Airuju!

833
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,676
- Yeonbal!
- Armored infantry!

834
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,011
Step forward!

835
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,099
Veterans, forward!

836
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,520
Charge!

837
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,318
Are you safe, Inaishingi?

838
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,444
What about Tae Maja?

839
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,862
No signal from the back yet?

840
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,323
No.

841
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,325
I think they failed.

842
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,951
Gosh, hey.

843
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,870
Untie me.

844
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:15,374
Inaishingi, Arthdal's army is coming.
East of Yangdaegil and north of Jemakgil

845
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:18,336
- are full of armored soldiers.
- It was just as expected.

846
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:21,088
Yes. Let's retreat
to the south of the Pine Tree Forest--

847
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,632
If Tae Maja failed,

848
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,009
that plan is useless.

849
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,552
But other than that...

850
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,721
- You'll lead them.
- Pardon?

851
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,557
If we go in to the forest like this,
we'll be annihilated.

852
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:35,228
That's why we made preparations
on the south of the Pine Tree Forest.

853
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,271
If we can't set fire to the enemy's rear,

854
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:39,357
- it's useless.
So?

855
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,609
You'll break through the enemies
to set the fires?

856
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,152
- That's nonsense!
He's right.

857
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,238
You must never.
You can't go, Inaishingi.

858
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,405
That's ridiculous.

859
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:47,573
Believe in me!

860
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:52,620
I will set fire

861
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:57,124
to the bottom of the Amdol Mountain,
behind the enemies' rear.

862
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,918
- But--
- Just like how you believed

863
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:02,755
in Inaishingi who jumped
into the waterfall 200 years ago,

864
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,091
believe me. Believe me,

865
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,261
retreat to the south as we planned,
and get ready.

866
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,387
Eunseom.

867
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,265
Inaishingi's life isn't yours.

868
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,227
Yes, you're right.

869
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,687
But so is Tagon!

870
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,355
I should sacrifice someone else.

871
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:21,399
I should do it willingly!

872
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:26,237
But if the Ago's army gets annihilated
and Inaishingi survives alone...

873
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,116
that's not Inaishingi anymore.

874
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:38,666
On this battlefield,
there are no superior or inferior lives.

875
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,877
I can do it best!

876
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,422
I'll prepare a horse.

877
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,633
I'll go through the radius.

878
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:48,801
I don't need a horse.

879
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,887
Then I'll escort you.

880
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,681
I'm coming with you too, Inaishingi.

881
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:10,448
All forces,
retreat to the Pine Tree Forest!

882
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,949
Yes, sir!

883
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,508
The main squad of the Ago

884
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:32,595
is being chased by the armored infantry
and are headed to the Pine Tree Forest.

885
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:38,225
Pressure them with veterans from the east
so they won't escape through Galgaetgol.

886
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:40,603
I will relay the message to them,
Your Majesty.

887
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,621
The Pine Tree Forest will be turned
into a sea of fire now.

888
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,290
- Get ready.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

889
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,875
Your Majesty!

890
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:09,465
There's a report saying someone who looks
like Inaishingi is heading north.

891
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:10,758
There are three of them.

892
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:12,760
Inaishingi jumped into our territory?

893
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,304
He might be trying to lure our troops.

894
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,181
Tell the front line to stop them,

895
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:20,184
and the rest to stay calm
and stick to the original plan.

896
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,936
Yes, Your Majesty.

897
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,982
Go quickly, Inaishingi.

898
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:22,705
Go now!

899
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:49,774
Hey.

900
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,275
It's all over.

901
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:52,902
So you tried to set fire here.

902
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,739
Yes. It was an amazing strategy,
but it failed.

903
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,617
I'll spare your life.

904
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,577
Give me that.

905
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:03,871
Give me that!

906
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,005
Kill him.

907
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:16,967
- What's that now?

908
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,546
Stop him!

909
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,742
No!

910
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,340
Tae Maja!

911
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,806
No!

912
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,272
ARTH FOREST, SOUTH

913
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,447
Don't look back!

914
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:07,906
Keep moving forward!

915
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:09,575
Don't fight them. Just run!

916
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:11,785
Don't stop!

917
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,831
Flame veterans, Row One.

918
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:17,583
Step forward!

919
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,097
Start.

920
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:33,682
Flame veterans, Row One.

921
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,017
Prepare to fire!

922
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:29,446
ARTH FOREST, NORTH

923
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:01,061
- They succeeded.
- All forces, start!

924
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:03,272
Archers, forward. Follow me!

925
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:38,765
Your Majesty.

926
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,603
The Ago Tribe set fire to the back.

927
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,271
What?

928
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:47,232
We're in the direction of the wind now.

929
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:49,443
We must escape. Give us the order now!

930
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,131
Fire!

931
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,345
Badoru!

932
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,103
Retreat!

933
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,192
What's that?
What's that smoke?

934
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:39,993
Fire

935
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:42,162
Fire!
Fire!

936
01:15:45,832 --> 01:15:47,251
Do not scatter!

937
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:50,879
Form a defensive formation
and march forward!

938
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,930
Run away!

939
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,848
We have to go. Run.

940
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:20,742
Your Majesty!

941
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,331
We must escape from the flames.

942
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:27,666
Stand up!

943
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,750
Now!

944
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,220
Your Majesty.

945
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:42,514
It's the whirlwind fire.

946
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:19,468
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

947
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:38,278
Only High Priest Asa Tanya
is left in Arthdal.

948
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:40,238
I wish to open the new sky of Arthdal.

949
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:43,408
You want to take over Arthdal
and give it to Eunseom

950
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:45,118
by turning Inaishingi into Aramun?

951
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:48,246
Following the High Priest is treason!

952
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:49,873
When there's a storm,

953
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:53,168
even the worst enemies
have to row together.

954
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:55,796
I will follow the queen and fight!

955
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:58,882
We must drag Asa Tanya,
the wicked fake Asa Sin,

956
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,219
and protect our Arthdal!
