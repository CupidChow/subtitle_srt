1
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:49,966
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

2
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,844
That is not what's important for you,
is it?

3
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,555
This is about who becomes the heir.

4
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,059
Whoever I am,
you need me right now, don't you?

5
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,977
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

6
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,188
The prince has been abducted.

7
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,522
What?

8
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,985
Is this boy really Tagon's son?

9
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,947
Did you summon me here?

10
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,909
Then the note in my sleeve...

11
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,118
Yes, that was me.

12
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,829
This is where Aramun is asleep.

13
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,915
Only the missionaries of the prophecy can.

14
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,833
Sword, Bell, and Mirror.

15
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,585
Therefore, the two of you must open it.

16
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,546
What are Sword, Bell, and Mirror?
And what's the mission?

17
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,215
It's an old prophecy of Arthdal.

18
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,884
It says Sword, Bell, and Mirror
will end the world.

19
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,594
Eunseom, you are the Sword.

20
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,516
Aramun was Igutu.

21
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:44,104
Before the sun sets,
come to the Ttesari Hill alone, Tagon.

22
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,066
If you wish to save your son,
you will have to sacrifice your life.

23
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,027
- Tagon is an Igutu.

24
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,244
Arok.
- Arok.

25
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,662
He's alive.

26
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,337
Step back.

27
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,924
Igutu.

28
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,275
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

29
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:34,904
Now

30
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,283
that Aramun has reclaimed
power and nature.

31
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,910
Airuju has bestowed the purple blood

32
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,997
of the most sacred Aramun.

33
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,626
as the proof of eternal blessings
to the heirs of Arthdal.

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,143
Tanya Niruha gave her blessings.

35
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,730
High Priest Niruha
gave the blessings of Airuju.

36
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,566
They are Tanya Niruha's blessings.

37
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,905
Aramun's purple blood
has been passed on to them.

38
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,615
I announce

39
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,284
that the Aramun dynasty,

40
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,330
the first dynasty of Arthdal, has begun.

41
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,501
Tanya Niruha.

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,381
Hurrah.

43
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,511
Hurrah.

44
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,014
All hail Tanya Niruha.

45
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,307
All hail Tanya Niruha.

46
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,861
All hail Tanya Niruha.

47
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,114
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

48
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,741
Tagon.

49
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,378
Niruha.

50
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,588
The king's wound is deep,

51
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,674
but he should be fine
once he gets treated.

52
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,050
That is a relief.

53
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,095
However, a lot of people
saw the king collapse.

54
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,222
Spread the word to the public

55
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,350
that the king was injured,
but he is still alive and well.

56
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,602
I understand, Niruha.

57
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,773
I will go to Aramun's tomb to pray.

58
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:38,319
Tell the priests to bring an oil lamp,
a thurible, liquor, and a glass.

59
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,404
Yes, Niruha.

60
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,658
You made the White Peak Mountain's Hearts'
long-time wish come true.

61
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,831
But this is about changing people's
long-standing thoughts.

62
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,668
We must not leave any chances for rifts.

63
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,796
We must stir up like a storm.

64
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,589
Yes, Niruha.

65
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,264
Aramun of Haesulla.

66
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,308
The messenger of Asa Sin

67
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,687
who came as an Igutu
and ascended to heaven with the wind.

68
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,731
Aramun of Haesulla.

69
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,441
The messenger of Asa Sin

70
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:21,112
who came as an Igutu
and ascended to heaven with the wind.

71
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,239
Aramun of Haesulla.

72
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,199
There's a tomb of Aramun?

73
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,452
Then what happens with the Igutus?

74
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,040
The White Peak Mountain's Hearts
were right?

75
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,666
It must be true.

76
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,627
What is going on?

77
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,713
They want me
to serve an Igutu as a king?

78
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,006
My goodness.

79
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,376
Do we really have
to serve an Igutu as a King?

80
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,422
White Peak Mountain's Hearts.
Does this make sense?

81
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,424
Purple blood...
An Igutu will become the King?

82
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,719
Right?

83
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,180
Still...

84
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,142
What will happen to the Igutus?

85
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,435
He was Igutu?

86
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,063
Gosh, do I need
to serve an Igutu as a king?

87
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,027
The White Peak Mountain's Hearts
were right?

88
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,946
What have I done?

89
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,576
Serve an Igutu as a king?

90
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,758
Thank you.

91
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,555
But I'll listen no matter what it is.

92
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,523
How can people do that?

93
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,774
Do what?

94
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,195
Ever since we were born, we learned that
Igutus were dirty and filthy.

95
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,780
But with one word from the High Priest...

96
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,825
The White Peak Mountain's Hearts
are the only ones excited.

97
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,327
You saw it just now.

98
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,537
They were painting Aramun's statue purple,

99
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,997
but nobody stopped them.

100
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,124
Then why didn't you stop them?

101
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,418
Well,

102
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,505
I'm not particularly against it.

103
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,639
Your Highness, did you plan this
with High Priest Niruha in advance?

104
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,099
No.

105
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,312
The High Priest did that
without even knowing

106
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,772
that the king was Igutu?

107
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:48,528
Then both the abduction
and Aramun's tomb happened

108
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,821
by coincidence.

109
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,449
Perhaps Tanya Niruha really is a god!

110
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,538
What is wrong, Your Highness?

111
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,791
Let's go see Arok.

112
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,097
She didn't fail
because of her greed and desires.

113
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,265
When you flip them,

114
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,268
they become fervent wishes and hopes.

115
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,397
I decided to consider the Ago Tribe's
selfish greed and ugly desires

116
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,650
as God's voice and became Inaishingi.

117
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,070
The first descendant of Asa Sin

118
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,197
hears the second descendant's words.

119
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,411
I don't know which descendant
is asking this question.

120
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,209
It's nothing, Niruha.

121
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,378
I cannot say it.

122
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,422
Whatever you want to say is fine.

123
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,798
Just tell me.

124
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,930
"Descendants of Asa Sin?"

125
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,349
"Don't be ridiculous."

126
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,145
"In the end, slaves are lesser than bugs.

127
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,689
"Someone like me is Asa Sin's descendant?"

128
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,108
"Tell her to stop lying."

129
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,070
"If she speaks nonsense, I will kill her."

130
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,200
That's what they said.

131
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,462
In the end,
God's voice was the people's voices.

132
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,339
The voice of every living thing

133
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,841
crying out loud.

134
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,218
In fact, God

135
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,597
never spoke.

136
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,606
What is this?

137
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:44,161
Aramun was put into the coffin alive.

138
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,332
And before he died, he engraved this.

139
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,710
Niruha.

140
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,795
The ministers have come to worship.

141
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:07,685
This is the last oracle left
by Aramun Haesulla.

142
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,607
"When the zelkova tree cracks
and my sword is revealed,

143
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,693
Aramun shall know their mission."

144
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,949
"When the Sword of Aramun
appears in the zelkova tree,

145
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,201
Aramun shall know their mission."

146
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,619
What does this mean?

147
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:32,042
I went there to find out what we should do
with the world that changed overnight.

148
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,795
I'm very worried about what might happen

149
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,213
and whether if this is okay.

150
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:40,217
How can people just accept
something as shocking as this?

151
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,012
An Igutu's blood became sacred overnight.

152
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,597
Why aren't you saying anything?

153
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,311
Shall I tell you a funny story?

154
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,021
What is it?

155
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,566
I met 11 people after what happened today.

156
00:12:55,566 --> 00:13:01,322
There were ministers, priests,
bachis, guards, and even a haho.

157
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,449
They all asked me the same thing.

158
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,742
What did they ask?

159
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,160
"How can people

160
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,497
accept something

161
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,290
as shocking as this

162
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,001
overnight?"

163
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,629
- That was the question.

164
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,799
You were the 12th person
to ask me that question.

165
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,718
Besides the White Peak Mountain's Hearts,

166
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,721
I'm sure hundreds more
have the same question.

167
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:32,520
Now, who are the people that are accepting
this big news overnight?

168
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,064
I'm not sure.

169
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,483
Locusts are different from birds.

170
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,152
They don't have a leader,
but they move somewhere.

171
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:44,365
If you grab one
and ask, "Why are you going that way?",

172
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,450
every locust
will give you the same answer.

173
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,952
What will they say?

174
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,747
"I'm not sure."

175
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,083
"Everyone was going that way."

176
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,007
What does that mean?

177
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,345
I think he's saying that Tanya Niruha
has turned us into locusts.

178
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,682
My goodness.

179
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,560
You must've been very shocked.

180
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,812
- How are you feeling?
- Yes.

181
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,397
I'm fine.

182
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,776
Were you scared?

183
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,956
I was scared.

184
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,336
I was scared too.

185
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,424
You were scared too, Mother?

186
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,927
I thought everything I built
with my own strength

187
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,513
was going to collapse.

188
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,142
It was the scariest moment of my life.

189
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,353
But I'm glad everything turned out well.

190
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,149
Tanya Niruha saved us.

191
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,402
- Arok.
- Yes, Mother.

192
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,279
Nobody can save us.

193
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,616
Only we can save ourselves.

194
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,993
But from now on,

195
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,455
I don't have to hide my purple blood.

196
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,458
Arok, we didn't achieve that
with our own strengths.

197
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,211
The one who'll be the king
shouldn't be grateful for what was given.

198
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,379
You need to doubt it.

199
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,008
Who gave it to you,
why they gave it to you,

200
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,218
and whether it's yours or not.

201
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,682
Tanya...

202
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,061
You did the right thing.

203
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,564
I didn't do it because
it was the right thing.

204
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,235
Do you know why I worked up

205
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,946
the courage?

206
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,201
Aramun is Igutu,
and so are you. That's why.

207
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,285
Tanya.

208
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,370
Stop it.

209
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,503
This is Aramun's will and last oracle.

210
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,718
So?

211
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,303
What does this mean?

212
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,388
I don't know.

213
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,348
But if the zelkova tree cracks

214
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,142
and a sword is revealed
as the oracle states,

215
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,020
I hope you realize that you're Aramun.

216
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,025
You believe in these things?

217
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,778
Tanya, I told you.

218
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,364
Even if anyone can become Aramun,

219
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,075
I can never be it.

220
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,411
Inaishingi.

221
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,329
Aramun's only enemy.

222
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,874
What do you think
is the biggest tragedy of this land?

223
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,961
It's Inaishingi.

224
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,588
- Why me?
- And Aramun Haesulla.

225
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,050
These two are the biggest tragedies.

226
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,685
No one can know about you.

227
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:04,606
You must never reveal your blood
nor get discovered.

228
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,442
Stop it.

229
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,820
- You must never reveal your blood...
- Pardon?

230
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,823
What did you say, Your Majesty?

231
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,991
Nor get discovered.

232
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,492
I said stop it.

233
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,994
Nobody must find out.

234
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:21,165
You must never reveal your blood
nor get discovered.

235
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,583
I said stop!

236
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,876
Please!

237
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,960
Stop!

238
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,799
Everyone, leave.

239
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,886
Now.

240
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,476
Tagon, what's wrong?

241
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,686
Look at me.

242
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,813
You know what happened, right?

243
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,732
I don't know.

244
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,905
Taealha heard this too.

245
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:57,201
Taealha fooled you
and made a political decision.

246
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,537
Mubaek tried to beat you instead.

247
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,542
What's wrong, Tagon?

248
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,213
My head hurts.
It feels like it's about to explode.

249
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,464
Call a yakbachi.

250
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,548
I understand.

251
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,680
What do you mean?

252
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,352
Originally, there were many gods
in Arthdal,

253
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,730
and people served different gods freely
as they liked.

254
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:32,069
Also, they did not reject other gods
just because they served one god.

255
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,862
I know. So?

256
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,157
Even before, when various gods
coexisted peacefully,

257
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,369
only two gods could not.

258
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,996
They were Aramun and Inaishingi.

259
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,541
Eunseom.

260
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,793
Even if you win this war,

261
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,088
will Arthdal's people follow Inaishingi?

262
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,841
They will resist endlessly.

263
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,425
Then you will end up

264
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,928
killing the people of Arthdal
and rule by blood.

265
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,888
That's no different from Tagon.

266
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,390
The opposite is the same.

267
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,936
In the end, this war will not end
until one side is annihilated.

268
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,898
That's inevitable.

269
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,400
Even if that were true,

270
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,819
there is no other way.

271
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,404
There is.

272
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,240
The being who is both

273
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,242
Inaishingi and Aramun.

274
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,661
Eunseom.

275
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,707
Why did your mother call you Aramun?

276
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,711
And why did you become Inaishingi?

277
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:35,174
When I realized that, I finally saw a way.

278
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,011
You will become Aramun Haesulla.

279
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,388
That is the only way to save this land.

280
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,310
How can I do that?

281
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:52,733
How can Inaishingi,
who has been Aramun's enemy for 200 years,

282
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,819
become Aramun Haesulla?

283
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,446
We must find a way.

284
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,990
That is your mission.

285
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,116
I do not believe

286
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,744
- in missions.
- No.

287
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,332
Even if you don't believe in it,
even if you abandon your mission,

288
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,833
the mission will come to you.

289
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,960
- So--
- Tanya.

290
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,757
You think the mission is important
right now?

291
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,219
We're parting ways now.

292
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,720
If we part ways now,

293
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,474
we don't know when we'll meet again.

294
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,685
We don't even know if we'll be alive.

295
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,770
So?

296
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,857
Do you want us to hug and cry
before parting ways?

297
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,528
Should we sling rocks and fight
before parting ways like we did before?

298
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,879
I will be back.

299
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,632
I promise.

300
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,697
What is this?
Why are you giving this to me?

301
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,532
This is yours.

302
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,662
It has been passed down
in the family of Ragaz.

303
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,999
He says it is passed down
in your father's family.

304
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,126
I can understand roughly.

305
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,088
Since you are Ragaz's son,

306
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,048
it is yours.

307
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,467
Not Eunseom's?

308
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,303
It is probably yours.

309
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,764
You're the older brother,
and you used to be more energetic.

310
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,104
What is this?

311
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,898
I don't know how long ago it was.

312
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:00,360
A long time ago, two brothers parted ways.

313
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,822
The brothers promised to meet one day
and each took one

314
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,366
so they could recognize each other

315
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,702
when they met again.

316
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,079
It's meaningless now.

317
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,583
So what if I meet him? I'm not a Neanthal.

318
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,086
Anyway, it is yours.

319
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,589
We don't have the right to this object.

320
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,717
He says it's yours anyway.

321
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,387
It is time for us to leave.

322
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,723
Let's meet again.

323
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,603
Let's meet again.

324
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,569
We need to go to Arthdal quickly.

325
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,071
What if we go?

326
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:46,948
"What if we go?"

327
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:53,080
You clearly said you don't know
what might happen to Nunbyeol

328
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,415
if you don't go back safely.

329
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,209
Nunbyeol will be fine.

330
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,669
You said Eunseom went to Arthdal.

331
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,214
That's what it seems like.
I can't be certain.

332
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,298
I'm certain.

333
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,175
I met him in my dream.

334
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,805
Eunseom is in Arthdal
as the head of the Royal Administration...

335
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,265
ARTHDAL'S SECRET INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION

336
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,809
...and as Tanya's lover.

337
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,277
So you're not going?

338
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,531
I should.

339
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,450
Even if I lost the war
and lost half of the troops,

340
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,661
I should go.

341
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,372
As the first commander that lost
to the Ago beasts,

342
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,249
even if I've been eliminated as an heir...

343
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,627
I should go.

344
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,004
Save me.

345
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,852
Run!

346
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,901
Run.

347
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,791
Are you okay?

348
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:08,089
- Who are they? Are they the Ago Tribe?

349
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,842
They're not the Ago Tribe.

350
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,553
I've never seen such clothes
and accessories.

351
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,649
Who are you lot?

352
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,113
There.

353
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,576
They're Igutu.

354
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,749
What are you lot? Who are you?

355
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,252
My God...

356
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,755
He's speaking our language.

357
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,675
Who are you?

358
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,969
He's right here...

359
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,096
Who's here?

360
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,348
He's right...

361
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,058
here.

362
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,106
Ikomahis.

363
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,237
Who are you?

364
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:40,557
THE GREAT GOCHIJU ROCK

365
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,611
What? They showed up and said, "Ikomahis"?

366
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,407
I told you. He clearly said that
to those people as he died.

367
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,285
So where are those people now?

368
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,871
I don't know. They must've parted ways.

369
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,917
You brat. How could you just come back?
Get up quickly. We need to find them.

370
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,338
What about the people
we promised to meet here?

371
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,131
They're important people.

372
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,424
This is more urgent.

373
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,010
Hurry up.

374
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,420
Ikomahis.

375
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,099
Where are the Neanthals? Did they leave?

376
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,101
Yes.

377
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:11,648
Did they say "Iko" something
when they saw you?

378
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,858
Or

379
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,527
when they saw that?

380
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,571
Do you know what it means?

381
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,948
I don't.

382
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,002
I will be back.

383
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,005
I promise.

384
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,386
How incredible.

385
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,179
So this really is

386
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,057
Aramun's tomb, is it?

387
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:52,313
"When the zelkova tree cracks
and my sword is revealed,

388
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,357
Aramun shall know their mission."

389
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:02,157
The king might cut down
every single zelkova tree in Arthdal.

390
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,452
What brings you
all the way here, Your Highness?

391
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,415
If announcing Igutus
as sacred beings was so easy,

392
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,085
I should've asked you to do it sooner.

393
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,671
Everyone believed

394
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,801
the purple blood he gave
as the proof of eternal blessings.

395
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,222
If you have nothing to say, please leave.

396
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,935
How did you know Tagon was Igutu?

397
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,521
You knew.

398
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,442
You wouldn't have engaged in
such a huge gamble without knowing.

399
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,655
Since when and how did you know?

400
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,076
Aramun Haesulla told me.

401
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,122
It was Saya, wasn't it?

402
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,584
He's the only one who could.

403
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,462
It is Saya.

404
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,424
He longed for you so much

405
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,552
that he let something so huge slip.

406
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,678
Right?

407
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,472
But why...

408
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,683
did you keep it a secret until now?

409
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,772
By any chance,

410
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,692
were you waiting until Arok was abducted?

411
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,236
I didn't know about it before.

412
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,199
If I had known,

413
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,035
I don't know what I might have done.

414
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,413
I could've ended both of you.

415
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,208
But now,

416
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,961
I also know how Arthdal works.

417
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,921
That's why I ended it here.

418
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,841
So shouldn't you express your gratitude

419
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,426
and respect to the High Priest?

420
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,182
Leave now.

421
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,228
Wait.

422
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,481
Recently.

423
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,150
You found out recently?

424
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,988
Yes, Your Highness. You should leave now.

425
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,866
You found out about it

426
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,119
from Saya, recently?

427
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,377
What's with that face?

428
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,879
Do you understand

429
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,381
what I mean?

430
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,177
You know about it.

431
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,429
Then why...

432
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,513
Your Highness.

433
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,810
I'll be on my way now, Niruha.

434
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,328
You also knew

435
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,622
that Saya wasn't Saya, didn't you?

436
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,766
What? What do you mean Dalsae?

437
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,225
Is Dalsae in Arthdal too?

438
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,102
There's no time to explain.

439
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,356
Go to the apothecary
and tell Dalsae to leave immediately.

440
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,149
- You must hurry.
- I understand.

441
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,533
Yes, it is Eunseom.

442
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,036
What are you going to do? Report it?

443
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,120
What about Lord Saya?

444
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,081
Is Lord Saya dead?

445
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,750
No, he is alive. I can feel him.

446
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,419
I am searching for him.

447
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,548
Niruha hid and helped Inaishingi,
the leader of the enemy?

448
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,426
- Keep it a secret.
- Do you think

449
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,303
- I'll actually follow that order?
- No.

450
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:56,307
I'm begging you to save him just once.

451
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,518
Or think of it this way.

452
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:02,021
I, High Priest Asa Tanya,
am indebted to you.

453
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,692
Eunseom will leave today.

454
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,859
Until then,

455
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,820
keep it a secret.

456
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,703
I am going to Molabeol.

457
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,372
Inform Commander Sodang.

458
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,959
Yes. I already sent a messenger
on a fast horse.

459
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,337
I will leave as soon as I meet the king.

460
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,880
I understand.

461
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,009
Organize the troops and come right away.

462
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,011
Yes, General.

463
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,562
Why are you still here?

464
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,274
Things happened.

465
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,860
I'm leaving soon.

466
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,486
Find Chaeeun and send her back.

467
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,949
Before that, tell her I am safe.

468
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,261
I heard there was a commotion.

469
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,722
It's probably because of the medicine.

470
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,434
I used strong medicinal herbs
because the wound was deep.

471
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,437
He won't be able to wake up.

472
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,231
Even if he does, he will be groggy.

473
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,158
Was it you?

474
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:46,250
- Your Majesty, please do not move.

475
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,674
Did you

476
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,843
plan this?

477
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,429
Lie down.

478
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,849
I was planning to go to Molabeol
right after seeing you.

479
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,017
The purple blood

480
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,396
was revealed to the world, as you wished.

481
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,148
Are you happy?

482
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,319
Are you unhappy?

483
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,081
We must kill everyone
who has seen our blood.

484
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,165
Now,

485
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,544
-   Igutus are not--
- Everyone is pretending...

486
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,172
in front of us.

487
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,676
We must not trust anyone.

488
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,805
We must kill everyone who has seen

489
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,141
our blood.

490
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,519
We must not reveal our blood...

491
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,481
nor get discovered.

492
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,158
Are you insane?

493
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,243
I do not wish to make you bleed.

494
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,204
This is Tanya Niruha's order.

495
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,248
Don't mess around
and get lost from Arthdal.

496
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,674
Lord Saya.

497
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,724
The queen wishes to see you
before you leave.

498
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,938
She wishes to meet you
to express her gratitude.

499
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,064
Please join us.

500
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,996
What is this about?

501
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,998
You didn't have to see me off like this.

502
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,376
A deal is a deal,

503
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,170
but I thought
I should express my gratitude

504
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,256
for your help in Ttesarichon.

505
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,637
Thank you. I mean it wholeheartedly.

506
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,278
Who are you?

507
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,072
Why are you in here?

508
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,451
- Where's General Saya?
- Lord Saya's gone.

509
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,703
- He disappeared.
- What?

510
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,330
What do you mean?

511
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,539
Mungtae's not around?

512
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,541
That day, he went to tail Lord Saya

513
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,293
saying something was off about him.

514
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,502
And?

515
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,049
Since then, I've been seeing Lord Saya,
but Mungtae's gone.

516
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,426
He's neither at home
nor with the royal guards.

517
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,013
Isn't he
a Wahan Tribe royal guard?

518
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,765
What happened to him?

519
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,224
His injuries aren't severe.

520
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,562
Keep an eye on him for a while
and let him go after we leave. Please.

521
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,813
You're leaving?

522
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,774
When?

523
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,235
As soon as Eunseom comes.

524
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,990
We'll come back.

525
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,369
Until then, stay safe. Understood?

526
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,206
Don't worry about me.

527
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,249
Take care.

528
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,002
If you die, I will kill you.

529
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,765
Hey. What the hell have you been doing?

530
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,017
Someone came here
looking for you just now.

531
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:59,063
- They knew my name? Who?
- Exactly.

532
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,565
How can there be someone
in Arthdal who knows you?

533
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,404
- So what did you say?
- That there wasn't anyone with that name.

534
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,906
I'm so anxious. Did we get caught?

535
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,367
- Come on. What did they look like?
- I don't know.

536
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,120
She was this tall and quite pretty.

537
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,955
But she suddenly said your name, so...

538
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,373
Dalsae.

539
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,918
Gosh.

540
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,672
Were you the one who was looking for me?

541
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,424
Yes, it was her.

542
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,008
Do you know her?

543
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,719
The queen abducted Eunseom.

544
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,013
- What?
- What?

545
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,807
Eunseom is gone.

546
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,392
He isn't in the palace,

547
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:40,062
the military division, or in Lord Saya's
house. Perhaps he has already left.

548
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,403
- You...

549
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,905
- Dalsae.
- Agaji.

550
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,868
Are you really Dalsae?

551
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:58,747
You are alive.

552
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,624
What about Eunseom?

553
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,751
Where is Eunseom?

554
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,087
I think

555
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,340
Eunseom has been abducted by the queen.

556
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,419
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

557
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,381
I have three questions.

558
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,009
First.

559
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,886
Who are you?

560
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,472
Pardon? Why do you want to know
all of a sudden?

561
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,434
I told you I'm just a dunce
who wanders all over the place.

562
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,395
Wrong.

563
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,439
Second.

564
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,358
What is your relationship with Tanya?

565
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,653
How sacrilegious.

566
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,322
What relationship would I have
with the High Priest?

567
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,783
Another wrong answer.

568
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,118
Third.

569
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,872
How did you know Tagon is Igutu?

570
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,666
How could I have known that?

571
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,919
The king is Igutu? I didn't know.

572
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,757
You answered all three questions incorrectly.

573
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,634
First.

574
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:37,763
You hugged the High Priest passionately
and stayed together with her for a while.

575
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:42,810
Second, before Aramun's tomb was revealed,
you met her there in secret.

576
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,271
If you thought I trusted you

577
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,815
and didn't keep my eyes on you,
you're in for disappointment.

578
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,234
I can explain.

579
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,694
Third.

580
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,363
You knew Tagon was an Igutu
from the beginning.

581
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,575
Your Highness, I don't know
what nonsense you've heard, but--

582
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,076
I may not be able to find out

583
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,204
who you are, what you're thinking,

584
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,166
or what you're planning.

585
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,294
I know. But I...

586
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,964
don't play games
unless I plan them myself.

587
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,882
I'll just upset the applecart.

588
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,385
Now...

589
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,138
So you, whose name I don't even know,

590
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,683
you'd better think
about my questions carefully

591
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,186
and answer well.

592
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,987
Confinement?
Why would the queen confine the general?

593
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,822
Exactly! How would I know?

594
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,741
Someone saw him getting dragged away.

595
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,118
The general is locked up
in the Fortress of Fire?

596
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,996
If not, why did they hide him in a chest?

597
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,915
Yeonbal, this is the queen's rebellion.

598
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:49,501
How dare she abduct the general
during the war?

599
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,253
Let's bring the military there.

600
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,880
That would be a real rebellion.

601
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,175
Let's bring Corp One
to the Fortress of Fire.

602
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,721
What? The Fortress of Fire?
Why go there when they need to leave soon?

603
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,222
I do not know.

604
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:05,100
Yeonbal and Commander Gitoha
are going there with soldiers.

605
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,315
Yeonbal, what is that lunatic
planning to do now?

606
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,484
Confinement?

607
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,569
The queen confined the general?

608
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,780
- Why?
I don't know.

609
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,365
Yeonbal and Commander Gitoha

610
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,993
rushed to the Fortress of Fire
saying that the general was confined.

611
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,078
There must have been
a misunderstanding.

612
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,289
Why would the queen confine him
when he needs to go to war?

613
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,625
I cannot figure out
what is happening either.

614
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,169
The king just keeps sleeping.

615
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,253
This is bad.

616
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,050
Things seem to be getting out of hand.

617
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:42,388
The Royal Guard Head led the guards
to the Fortress of Fire just now.

618
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,514
What?

619
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,517
What is happening?

620
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,730
Yeolson, something must have happened.

621
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,942
Mungtae disappeared and Lord Saya
was dragged to the Fortress of Fire.

622
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,112
Maybe the queen caught on to something.

623
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,780
Let's meet Niruha first.

624
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,532
Okay, let's go to the Great Shrine.

625
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,327
You two. Where are you going
at this time of night?

626
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,704
- To the Great Shrine.
- What?

627
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,122
Niruha probably isn't there.

628
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,750
THE WAHAN TRIBE

629
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,587
This won't do.

630
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,922
I'll go out and...

631
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,924
It's even more dangerous
for you to go.

632
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,385
I will go and find out.

633
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,430
Susu.

634
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,514
Why haven't you left?

635
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,309
Why are you here, Niruha?

636
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,061
Mungtae.

637
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,440
Look here.

638
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,400
Dalsae is here.

639
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,320
Yes, we've already met.

640
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,536
Susu Eunseom was taken away?

641
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,746
Yes.

642
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:52,833
But since Commanders Yeonbal
and Gitoha have gone...

643
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,676
Dalsae, how are you here?

644
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,892
Dalsae, Dalsae.

645
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,144
Mungtae, why are you here, too?

646
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,234
You must be surprised.

647
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,488
Dalsae became a merchant
and came to Arthdal--

648
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,114
He's Eunseom.

649
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,034
Eunseom?

650
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:30,913
General Saya is Eunseom, not Saya. Right?

651
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,836
Please go out and check the surroundings.

652
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:38,962
I will.

653
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,135
Niruha, is that true?

654
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,220
Is he Eunseom?

655
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,848
Please say something.

656
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,099
My goodness.

657
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,392
It must be true.

658
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:59,650
Just what on earth is going on?

659
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,987
Then did the queen drag Lord Saya away
because he got caught?

660
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,155
Dragged him away?

661
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,866
Yes, I think he got caught.

662
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,540
Well, the queen
knows he isn't Saya,

663
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,167
but I don't think the queen found out
he's Eunseom.

664
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,879
If he's been caught by Taealha,
it's only a matter of time.

665
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,465
Commander Yeonbal went
to the Fortress of Fire,

666
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,550
so let's check--

667
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:29,096
The Royal Guard Head is already
headed there with the guards to stop that.

668
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,723
How absurd.

669
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,934
- Who abducted who?
- Yes.

670
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,479
I heard such an absurd rumor,
so I just wanted to check.

671
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,858
Is that why you brought
all these soldiers here?

672
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,778
- Are you going to force your way in?
- Hey.

673
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,947
Is the general inside or not?

674
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,324
What are you doing?

675
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,492
Stop them.

676
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,294
Open the door.

677
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,343
The queen formed an alliance with him
knowing he wasn't Saya.

678
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,511
She fooled the king.

679
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,390
- She won't be able to expose him openly.
No.

680
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,184
It will change
once she finds out that he is Inaishingi.

681
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,729
What should we do?

682
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,272
Everything will be revealed,

683
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,525
and you hid Inaishingi of all people.

684
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,152
We're all doomed.

685
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,740
I will go.
What?

686
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,493
I just need to
save Eunseom and leave quietly.

687
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,204
You? How can you do that?

688
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,458
You know nothing
about the Fortress of Fire.

689
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,792
Why wouldn't I?

690
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,377
We were all locked up in there.

691
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,963
That's the place I abandoned you.

692
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,883
I've never forgotten it.

693
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,011
Let me go with you.

694
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,097
That idiot will get lost on the way there.

695
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,807
Susu Mungtae.

696
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,976
You said you abandoned me
because you were afraid,

697
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,145
not because I was bothersome.

698
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,689
How can I leave it to that coward?

699
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:03,982
I must go with him.

700
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,819
- I'll go too.

701
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,281
I know the Fortress of Fire
like the back of my hand.

702
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,326
I think I know
where Eunseom is being held.

703
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:15,953
Let's try this.

704
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,287
Okay.

705
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,832
Let's try this, yes.

706
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,920
We'll work something out,
so go to the Great Shrine.

707
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,130
There is a secret passage.

708
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,675
- A secret passage?
- Last time, Saya let me

709
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,844
go into the Fortress of Fire
using that passage.

710
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:35,180
That was when I was a slave,

711
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,433
so it was a very long time ago,
but if that passage still exists...

712
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,564
How dare you
lead the soldiers here at night?

713
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,651
- This is a rebellion.
- A rebellion?

714
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,861
We only brought 10 soldiers.

715
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,238
Is that a rebellion?

716
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,656
Leading the soldiers

717
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,326
of the military division
without the king's order is a rebellion.

718
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,621
Then isn't confining the general

719
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,999
- a rebellion?
- You bastard.

720
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,459
How dare you speak such nonsense?

721
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,878
I'm telling you, someone clearly saw it!

722
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,717
Your Highness.

723
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,093
I am sure somebody did.

724
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:19,307
Yes. General Saya is here.

725
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,602
But what is wrong with that?

726
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,916
Officially speaking, I am Saya's mother.

727
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,919
I'm just meeting my son
who is going to war tomorrow.

728
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,796
Why are you raising a ruckus?

729
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,548
Nothing happened,

730
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,384
so Commanders, please go back.

731
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,386
You heard her.

732
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,556
Everyone, dismissed.

733
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,768
We will not leave
until we see that the general is safe.

734
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,681
Goodness.

735
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,809
How long will you...

736
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,356
Minister, what brings you here?

737
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,440
Eunseom.

738
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,239
- Eunseom.
- Dalsae.

739
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,117
Let's leave quickly.

740
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,494
You're here to save me?

741
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,958
No.

742
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,044
I came here to save all of us.

743
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,604
Who's there?

744
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,315
What should we do?

745
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,442
Go.

746
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,236
Let's go.

747
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,113
Hey.

748
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,698
Well.

749
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,991
I'm a royal guard.

750
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,534
A royal guard?

751
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,828
How is a royal guard here?

752
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,163
Who's there?

753
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,832
You must be feeling unwell.
Stand behind me.

754
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,125
Stop with your bravado.

755
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,716
Here.

756
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,347
Hurry up.

757
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,445
Intruders!

758
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,199
We'll leave once we see the general.
Is that so difficult to do?

759
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,743
If you do not go back,
I will arrest you all.

760
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,453
Guards!

761
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,669
If you wish to shed blood that much,
you shall.

762
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,326
You know Dalrae Dock, right?

763
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,286
Go quickly.

764
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,622
I'm sorry...

765
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,627
for what happened back then.

766
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,588
I'm also...

767
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,302
Don't forgive me.

768
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,012
Go.

769
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:43,947
Catch him.

770
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,241
- Search everywhere and get him.
Yes.

771
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,552
What do you think you're doing?

772
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,430
Can't you see?

773
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,182
The Sul Clan are leaving the union,
as you said.

774
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,646
Go back to your position.

775
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,482
Who are you to order me around?

776
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:24,279
How dare you give me orders
when Inaishingi isn't around?

777
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,409
Horses are dying from an epidemic.

778
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:33,246
Arthdal's horses are fine,
but only our horses are dying.

779
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,707
Inaishingi has disappeared too.

780
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,667
This is for crossing the Notsan River.

781
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,419
It's the curse of the gods of Arth.

782
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,587
How dare you!

783
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,179
Don't do this, Chief.

784
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,349
Tachukan! Put away your sword.

785
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,311
Tachukan.

786
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,442
How did it go?

787
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,361
We barely managed to calm them,

788
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,489
but Sul Sagang said something unnecessary.

789
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:10,367
We must not let the news
of Inaishingi's absence spread.

790
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,035
How can we keep their mouth shut?

791
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:16,664
As soon as morning comes,
they will ask about Inaishingi's absence.

792
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,209
We have nothing to tell them.

793
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,710
The epidemic is an issue too.

794
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,631
The horses are becoming useless
one by one.

795
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,387
Why is there no news
from Ipsaeng and Dalsae?

796
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,098
Also, why is Mirusol nowhere to be seen?

797
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:37,227
She went on a search again
with Badoru to find him somehow.

798
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:51,866
Hey.

799
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,451
We searched this place before.

800
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,746
Oh... Did we?

801
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,332
Then over there.

802
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,209
Let's check below the rocky mountain.

803
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,502
Mirusol.

804
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,712
We searched there thoroughly
in the morning.

805
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,757
Get a hold of yourself.

806
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,301
We'll find him.

807
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,970
We can find him.

808
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,525
What are you doing?

809
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,154
We must leave this forest
even if you want to rest.

810
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,613
Stand up.

811
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,032
Eunseom is taking my place in Arthdal.

812
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:37,412
And I have no idea what he is thinking.

813
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,289
On top of that,

814
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,375
he is Inaishingi.

815
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,335
What should I do there?

816
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,129
Do you have a plan?

817
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,422
Figure that out yourself.

818
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,591
I only know one thing.

819
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,927
I need to meet Nunbyeol.

820
00:57:57,515 --> 00:58:00,143
By the way, since when
did you speak casually to me?

821
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,438
I can do worse things
if something happens to Nunbyeol.

822
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,356
Like what?

823
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,567
I will kill you.

824
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:34,469
You must never reveal your blood
nor get discovered.

825
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,769
Nobody must find out.

826
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:04,874
Your Majesty.

827
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,292
You shouldn't move yet.

828
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,919
You need to get more sleep.

829
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,339
May I check your wound?

830
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,465
Your Majesty.

831
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,936
They had help from the outside.

832
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,772
And I don't know how this happened,

833
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,150
but they came through our secret passage.

834
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,403
Only you, me,

835
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,405
and Lord Saya know about it.

836
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,448
Your Highness.

837
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,120
You must head to the palace urgently.

838
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,046
This is as far as I can go.

839
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,466
I cannot say

840
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,011
- that I'm thankful.
- Yes.

841
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,847
We did this for all of us.

842
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:01,931
Now,

843
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:06,561
let us end
our ill-fated relationship here, Eunseom.

844
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,355
Do not come back.

845
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:11,649
No.

846
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,027
I will come back

847
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,279
as Inaishingi

848
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,948
with countless warriors of the Ago Tribe.

849
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,379
Take this.

850
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,070
- What is this?
- An iron sword.

851
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,076
They say if you make a sword

852
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,037
out of iron, it breaks or bends easily.

853
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,164
Is that so? Do you think it will break?

854
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,333
Do you think it will bend?

855
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:14,087
We finally made iron swords.

856
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,005
Arthdal has come this far.

857
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:19,175
It's much lighter
and stronger than bronze.

858
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,803
Above all, we can make a lot

859
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,346
very easily.

860
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,265
You probably even lack bronze swords.

861
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:28,601
Thousands and millions
of Arthdal's soldiers

862
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,520
will be armed with iron swords now.

863
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:34,273
You lot can never win this war.

864
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,025
Please go back across the Notsan River.

865
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,276
RIVER BORDERING ARTHDAL

866
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,528
Take that with you.

867
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:42,281
Show that to your people
and persuade them. By doing so,

868
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,827
I hope you will save
many lives of the Ago Tribe

869
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,413
who will die in vain.

870
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,156
Eunseom.

871
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,159
You're Eunseom, aren't you?

872
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,203
You are Eunseom, right?

873
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,332
You are.

874
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,877
Eunseom.

875
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:37,503
It's me.

876
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,046
I'm Buksoe.

877
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,840
Buksoe of the Wahan Tribe.

878
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,342
Eunseom.

879
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:46,053
Buksoe seems to know him.

880
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:49,515
It's them. Ikomahis.

881
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,435
- Ikomahis...
Excuse me.

882
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,438
Do you remember me?

883
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,857
Right.

884
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,442
We met in the herb room.

885
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,862
How are you with Eunseom?

886
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,530
Well,

887
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:08,159
this person isn't...

888
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,369
Inaishingi.

889
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:14,957
It's Inaishingi.

890
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,376
Inaishingi is here.

891
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,474
Inaishingi.

892
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,184
Inaishingi.

893
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:04,882
What is it?

894
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,718
You put Tanya Niruha in too much danger.

895
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,890
Die here, Inaishingi.

896
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,906
A lightning scar?

897
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,367
LICHTENBERG FIGURE

898
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:47,938
"When the zelkova tree cracks

899
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,941
and my sword is revealed,

900
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,362
Aramun shall know their mission."

901
01:07:58,407 --> 01:07:59,408
Is that

902
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,577
Aramun's sword?

903
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,122
Go and tell the High Priest two things.

904
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:08,375
That is the price of your life.

905
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:16,467
Aramun's sword was found
in the zelkova tree.

906
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:18,511
What nonsense is that?

907
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,722
- There's nothing inside.
No.

908
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:27,019
From now on, this is Aramun's sword.

909
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,028
No matter how you see it,

910
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,280
this sword is mine.

911
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:41,867
Tell her!

912
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,578
I, Eunseom of the Wahan Tribe,

913
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:48,958
will become Inaishingi

914
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,836
and Aramun Haesulla!

915
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,751
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

916
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,366
Inaishingi has returned.

917
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:06,619
That bastard isn't Inaishingi.

918
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,204
They are benetbeot.

919
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,955
He isn't Inaishingi.
Are you mad?

920
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:12,458
What makes the horses fall ill...

921
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,084
Eunseom took my place.

922
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:15,961
I don't see why I can't do the same.

923
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,421
If the sword has been revealed

924
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,632
- but I do not know the mission,
It's the sword of Aramun.

925
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,425
does that mean I am not Aramun?

926
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:23,302
Tagon is hallucinating.

927
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,804
You must kill everyone now.

928
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,057
I will not be fooled

929
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,600
by you

930
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,268
nor the prophecy.
