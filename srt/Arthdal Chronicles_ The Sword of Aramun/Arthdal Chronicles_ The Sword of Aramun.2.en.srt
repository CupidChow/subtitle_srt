1
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:49,966
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

2
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,642
Your long-lasting rebellion

3
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,978
has finally come to an end.

4
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,396
Congratulations.

5
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,732
Only the Bato Tribe
by the Notsan River is left.

6
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,400
Saya will finish them well

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,568
along with Inaishingi.

8
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,988
Have you really seen
Inaishingi's face?

9
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,532
Yes, it's a face I'll never forget.

10
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,784
Get ready.

11
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,952
We need to make him
take off that ugly visor

12
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,829
and show his face today.

13
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,419
Shall we go out?

14
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,215
If Lord Saya sees his face...

15
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,675
he'll be very surprised.

16
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,260
Have you ever seen the face

17
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,137
of Eunseom?

18
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,019
Eunseom is Inaishingi.

19
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,896
Did Eunseom see you?

20
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:45,980
He didn't.

21
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,484
Inaishingi, hurry up.

22
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,571
Because I hid like a fool.

23
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,699
She's the only Neanthal
in the world that uses swords.

24
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,409
What could beat her?

25
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,704
Can she beat Tagon's
monstrous strength?

26
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,998
I'll send you
into the palace as a servant.

27
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,253
The owner of your name commands.

28
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,379
Help Eunseom.

29
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,839
Save Eunseom.

30
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,008
You don't know
how Arthdal warriors fight on plains.

31
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,094
We won't fight on the plains.

32
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,055
Do you know who you're fighting?

33
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,605
Come back alive.

34
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,731
What about Eunseom?

35
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,191
Don't kill him.

36
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:48,835
WAR OF TWINS

37
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,927
EUNSEOM

38
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,346
SAYA

39
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,325
As the king said,

40
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,077
it seems like most of
the Ago Tribe's troops are here.

41
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,162
Yes.

42
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,040
The war could have lasted
for more than 10 years,

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,125
but we're going to end it today.

44
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,213
We might not even need Mubaek.

45
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,176
Is this not mine?

46
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,804
Is the visor small or is your head big?

47
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,140
The visor is small, obviously.

48
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,356
GREAT COMMANDER MUBAEK

49
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,982
Just do as you trained.

50
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,276
- Don't be nervous.
- Nervous?

51
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,738
Who gets nervous going against beasts?

52
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,075
They'll pee their pants
as soon as we fight them.

53
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,706
Shall we start?

54
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,875
The general of Arthdal commands.

55
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,710
Commander Sodang of Division One!

56
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,798
Cavalry One!

57
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,091
Charge!

58
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,175
Let's go!

59
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,516
In the names

60
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,559
of the waterfall and the Agoha Forest!

61
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,021
Under the name of Inaishingi!

62
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,773
Let's go!

63
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,119
Wipe out the Ago's beasts!

64
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,633
Yeonbal.

65
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,636
I think we need Mubaek.

66
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,555
Yes, General.

67
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,849
Tachukan! Tae Maja!

68
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,438
Shoot the smoke arrows.

69
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,812
How pitiful.

70
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,357
Inaishingi, we have to retreat.

71
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,234
I'll lure them. Escape.

72
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,318
No.

73
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,404
I'll kill the general of Arthdal.

74
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,863
You can't. Eunseom.

75
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,033
Arthdal will be fine even if he dies.

76
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,661
But without you, it's the end of Ago.

77
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,174
Retreat!

78
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,926
Retreat!
Retreat!

79
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,345
Retreat!

80
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,471
Retreat!

81
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,223
Retreat!

82
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,142
Retreat.

83
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,560
Retreat.
Retreat.

84
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,395
Retreat!

85
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,230
- Retreat!
Retreat!

86
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,526
Retreat!

87
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,069
Hyah!

88
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,745
It's meaningless
if we don't capture Inaishingi.

89
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,663
Capture Inaishingi!

90
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,416
Go after them!

91
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,472
He's going for Lord Saya.

92
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,057
Chase him!

93
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,192
What can you do alone?

94
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,415
The horses...

95
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,708
The horses are acting strange.

96
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,670
What's going on?

97
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,963
Mubaek!

98
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,177
What's wrong with the horses?

99
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,096
What's going on?

100
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,223
The horse won't move forward.

101
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,433
Could it be Kanmoreu?

102
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,443
Stop him!

103
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,671
Got you.

104
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,900
Catch him.

105
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,234
Catch him.

106
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,403
Helper, now's the time.

107
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,829
Helper, one more time.

108
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,012
Mubaek, that's Kanmoreu.

109
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,234
There's a saying from long ago
that when Kanmoreu began to run,

110
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,862
the enemy's horses all followed it.

111
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,450
It's Kanmoreu.

112
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,383
It's the whistle arrow of the Ago Tribe.

113
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,301
AN ARROW THAT MAKES A SOUND

114
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,996
We don't have more cavalry now.

115
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,080
General.

116
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,874
You need to order a retreat.

117
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,334
General, you must hurry.

118
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,020
- General!
General.

119
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,980
General, are you okay?

120
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,433
There's no news from the front line.

121
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,352
We'll get one soon.

122
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,229
The general may be smart,

123
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,814
but he learned wars from books.

124
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,608
I'm worried.

125
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,944
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

126
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,660
Your Majesty.

127
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,872
The number of people petitioning
about slaves is growing.

128
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,248
Slaves?

129
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,125
- What about the slaves?
Well.

130
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,545
High Priest Tanya
treats the slaves too well.

131
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,297
That's right, Your Highness.

132
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,715
All the people inside and outside

133
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,467
the castle are

134
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,761
giving up their food
for Arthdal's victory.

135
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,098
But High Priest feeds
and looks after slaves every day.

136
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,434
Furthermore, she forbade
the slave owners from punishing the slaves

137
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,144
and to feed them three times a day.

138
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,774
That's right.

139
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,943
People can put up with their own hunger,

140
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,570
but they cannot stand
those under them eating well.

141
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,867
I see you bought that too.

142
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,452
That bracelet.

143
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,205
Your Highness.
You can't buy this with riches.

144
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,873
Only with sincerity and faith--

145
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,291
But mostly,

146
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,627
you must've given her riches, right?

147
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,629
Just how many people are wearing them?

148
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,423
A lot of people want them.

149
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,675
Both the rich and poor.

150
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,052
She's pretty good.

151
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,889
I'll ask the high priest
about the slaves issue.

152
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,974
Next.

153
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,726
Due to the troops' food supply,

154
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,310
the price of crops increased,

155
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,397
people in the castle
are starting to starve.

156
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,648
The price increases

157
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,985
because there are merchants
who hoard the crops for themselves.

158
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,904
Find them and punish them.

159
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,741
Behead one or two to set an example.

160
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,285
Yes, we will do as you say.

161
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,412
But that's not enough
to help those starving--

162
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,705
Enough.

163
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,291
The issue will be resolved
as soon as the war's over.

164
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,878
Has the messenger arrived?

165
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,465
Not yet,
but the war should be over by now.

166
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,549
Yes.

167
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,717
How can those beasts

168
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,762
fight against our troops on the plains?

169
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,325
With the horse of the heaven,

170
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,745
Inaishingi defeated Arthdal.

171
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:01,997
Horse of the heaven.

172
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,957
- Horse of the heaven!
- Horse of the heaven!

173
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,834
Horse of the heaven!

174
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:10,422
- Horse of the heaven!
- Horse of the heaven!

175
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,799
Horse of the heaven!

176
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,842
- Horse of the heaven!
- Horse of the heaven!

177
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,260
Horse of the heaven.

178
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,887
Horse of the heaven!

179
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,389
Horse of the heaven!

180
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,851
Horse of the heaven!

181
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,145
SUHANA

182
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,369
Horse of the heaven!

183
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,284
It hurts.

184
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,461
It was that horse.

185
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,172
The horse I saw in Iark.

186
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,550
Mubaek, Mugwang,
and I tried to chase after it.

187
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,136
None of us could keep up.

188
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,430
Our horses refused to move forward.

189
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,016
It's Kanmoreu.

190
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,727
Why would Kanmoreu help the Ago Tribe?

191
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,395
Aramun Haesulla is in Arthdal.

192
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,480
THE LEGENDARY HORSE KNOWN
TO HAVE BEEN RIDDEN BY ARAMUN HAESULLA

193
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,275
Don't raise your voice.

194
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,156
How bad is the damage?

195
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,866
How many died?

196
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,326
I don't know.

197
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,911
The number keeps increasing.

198
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,121
Horses are another problem.

199
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,915
We lost too many horses.

200
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,542
Did you send the messenger to Arthdal?

201
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,586
Well...

202
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,005
The general told me not to send one.

203
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,432
What are you doing?

204
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,309
Don't stand there. Come and hold him.

205
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,395
Me?

206
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,608
What are you waiting for? Go.

207
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,319
Goodness.

208
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,372
Hey.

209
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,706
- Hey, wait...

210
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,588
Here.

211
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,929
What are you doing?

212
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,764
Press it down until the bleeding stops.

213
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:07,975
Okay.

214
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,024
Does she really not know Mugwang?

215
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,696
The General locked her up
for a long time to investigate.

216
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,239
He would've been thorough.

217
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,741
Where is General Saya?

218
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,077
After entering his barrack,

219
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,704
he hasn't come out at all.

220
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,045
You stupid fool.

221
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,771
Are you crazy?

222
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,732
Do you want them to find out
you're an Igutu?

223
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,317
HALF BLOODS BORN BETWEEN A SARAM
AND A NEANTHAL, THEIR BLOOD IS PURPLE

224
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,860
AND ARE PERSECUTED BEINGS IN ARTHDAL

225
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,656
Get a grip.

226
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,116
You know him too, right?

227
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,076
Eunseom.

228
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,413
- Why bring him up all of a sudden?
- That Eunseom...

229
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,459
is Inaishingi.

230
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,085
What...

231
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,630
do you mean? Eunseom's what?

232
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,715
Dujeumsaeng of Iark.

233
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,717
DEROGATORY NAME FOR THE IARKS

234
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,054
His clan was slaughtered
or turned into slaves.

235
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,515
He barely survived and escaped.

236
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,976
Without getting injured...

237
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,481
It would be a miracle if he's alive.

238
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,484
- But...
- No way.

239
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,527
Is it really Eunseom?

240
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,572
How...

241
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,288
Yes. That Eunseom

242
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,333
became the strongest warrior
of the east of the continent.

243
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,002
And today!

244
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,756
He destroyed Arthdal's most elite troops.

245
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,216
Huh...

246
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,301
Eunseom

247
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,137
is Inaishingi?

248
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,222
I...

249
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,057
cannot forgive...

250
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,229
I cannot forgive him.

251
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,878
Did you see Inaishingi's face?

252
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,174
Since when did you know?

253
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,926
There's no way I could've known.

254
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,679
I saw him for the first time
in today's battle.

255
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,229
What should we do now?

256
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,313
Lord Saya.

257
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,568
You said you would accept your mission.

258
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,319
Sword and Mirror.

259
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,613
You decided to be
with your brother, Eunseom.

260
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,867
Didn't you make a promise to Tanya Niruha?

261
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,914
I didn't know he was the head
of the Ago Tribe then.

262
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,999
Actually, there was

263
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,543
no reason for you two to fight.

264
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,171
Forget it.

265
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,344
Hey.

266
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,763
How did you come in here?

267
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,391
Speak now.

268
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,476
Who are you?

269
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,560
Answer me!

270
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,771
How did you get in? Answer me now.

271
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,609
What happened?

272
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,527
Great Commander.

273
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,238
We found a child hidden in the barracks.

274
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,490
I was interrogating her.

275
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,117
I thought
she could be the Ago Tribe's yeomari.

276
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,202
A SPY

277
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,669
A yeomari wouldn't have stolen crops.

278
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,553
Are you hungry?

279
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,891
Did you run away from Hanchoa Castle

280
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,976
to avoid the battle?

281
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,065
What about your parents?

282
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,820
Take her to Chaeeun and tell her

283
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,615
to feed her, wash her,

284
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,992
- and give her fresh clothes.
Sir?

285
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,412
From this war,

286
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,998
how many children will become war orphans?

287
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,961
I was a war orphan too.

288
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,249
NEANTHAL, ISSRUV: NEANTHAL

289
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,669
I heard Inaishingi was an Igutu.

290
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,714
We should check if he's Ragaz's son.

291
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,675
We grew up together,

292
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,136
but I don't understand Rottip.

293
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,432
Imagine how it must be for me
when even you can't.

294
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,351
Good thing we came without Rottip.

295
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,728
I mean, what?

296
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,646
It's meaningless?

297
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,024
What's the point of checking now?

298
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,319
If this is meaningless,
what in this world has meaning?

299
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,362
Why bother living?

300
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,866
Nosunaho, I had this thought for a while.

301
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,369
I think you and I click.

302
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,582
You're much older than me.

303
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,376
How could you just leave Rottip like that
and come?

304
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,503
We should've brought Rottip with us!

305
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,632
Why bring up my age?

306
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,592
We're not Saram.

307
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,267
We might

308
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,478
scare them.

309
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,448
I never saw any beings
that didn't care about us at all

310
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,574
like them.

311
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,410
They're the Children of Shahati.

312
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,120
WHITE MOUNTAIN
TRIBE'S SECRET ASSASSIN GROUP

313
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,372
What are they

314
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,916
doing here?

315
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,591
The reports you made.

316
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,259
I was heedless.

317
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,720
Tanya was pretty good.

318
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,142
Make a list of the people
who donate a lot to the Great Shrine.

319
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,332
The black hue is almost gone.

320
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,252
I think it can end now.

321
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,589
In the name of Aramun
and the king of Arthdal,

322
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,925
I end the punishment.

323
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,346
Why are you so taken aback?

324
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,265
Try speaking.

325
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,850
Don't tell me you forgot how.

326
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,980
It must still feel awkward.

327
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,648
Speak when you want to.

328
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,776
Do you know
what the last thing you said was?

329
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,989
"Mom."

330
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,243
Did you know how to smile?

331
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,164
The war will end soon.

332
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,041
You'll be able to see your mother again.

333
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,377
She'll be very happy

334
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,088
to see you smile.

335
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,633
For such a long time
in the foreign land of Ago,

336
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,135
she went through so much.

337
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,597
I'll definitely repay her.

338
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,662
You found out nothing?

339
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,707
A prince of a kingdom nearly got murdered.

340
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,210
But there's no evidence.

341
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,629
Actually, we need to investigate Saya,

342
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,672
but he's not here.

343
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,508
When he comes back...

344
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,592
Yes.

345
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,345
We should ask if he comes back.

346
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,597
If he can come back.

347
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,100
What about Hae Kkadak?

348
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,228
Could you still not find him?

349
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,356
Well... I think something's wrong.

350
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,983
Mihol helped Hae Kkadak break out

351
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,610
a very long time ago.

352
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,238
If he knew what was happening in Arthdal,

353
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,697
he should've come back already.

354
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,283
After Hae Alyeong passed away,

355
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,494
there's no bachi as skilled as Hae Kkadak.

356
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,662
A CRAFTSMAN OR ENGINEER

357
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,205
Please try harder, Minister.

358
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,709
I will, Your Highness.

359
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,844
Where's Shahati?

360
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,513
Pardon? Why all of a sudden...

361
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,516
I told her to aim for it after the war.

362
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,310
It might be over by now.

363
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,312
What? What's over?

364
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,107
What's happening?

365
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,026
I mean,

366
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,281
I'm nervous as it is already
because the messenger hasn't come.

367
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,993
I was wondering
if you planned something again.

368
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,911
Don't worry about the war.

369
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,913
The moment the Ago came out on the plains,

370
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,623
they were done for.

371
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,084
What about Yeolson?

372
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,836
Come on, Yeolson.

373
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:24,924
Why would I secretly throw away
iron scraps like these?

374
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,552
These aren't just iron scraps.

375
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,888
They're iron ingots made of pure iron.

376
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,514
Is that so?

377
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,892
I can't tell.

378
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,227
Look. Why are you acting like this?

379
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,063
I'm asking to give you a big award.

380
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,775
How did you make them?

381
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,486
Did you add other ingredients?

382
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,199
It's okay. Tell me.

383
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,413
I want to meet High Priest Niruha.

384
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,708
Then I'll decide
whether to tell you or not.

385
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,843
You can't do that.

386
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,473
What?

387
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,682
Yeolson?

388
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,767
Now?

389
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,748
You're foolish.

390
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,292
Are you doing this
trusting your daughter will save you?

391
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,677
Is he insane?

392
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,429
Do I trust my daughter?

393
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,351
What I trust...

394
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,688
isn't my poor daughter.

395
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,857
It's iron!

396
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,324
With enough riches
to make these bronze chains,

397
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,867
I can make enough iron chains

398
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,912
to tie up all the bachis
in the Fortress of Fire.

399
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,790
A scientist like you should know.

400
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,543
With the knowledge in my head,

401
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,545
history will change big time.

402
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,089
But you want to kill me?

403
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:29,966
Can you?

404
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,427
Scientists

405
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,762
can never kill another scientist

406
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,305
who is ahead of them.

407
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,391
If you can do that,

408
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,476
you're not from the Hae Tribe

409
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,937
nor a scientist.

410
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,623
DWELLING OF HAE TRIBE MANAGED BY TAEALHA

411
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,338
What in the world are you doing?

412
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:12,842
The queen is in charge of
everything that happens here.

413
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,679
How dare mere guards come here?

414
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,639
Just how...

415
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,391
It's the king's order.

416
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,479
Then the king should come here himself.

417
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,022
Are you looking for me?

418
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,033
Your Majesty.
May the honor of Airuju be with you.

419
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,329
I have something to ask Yeolson.

420
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,706
Can I not?

421
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,000
Well...

422
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,294
Of course you can.

423
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,184
Yeolson works in the Bronze Workshop.

424
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,435
He's not from the Hae Tribe.

425
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,603
Our negotiation states

426
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,731
Bronze Workshop, the Hae Tribe,
and the secret of bronze are yours.

427
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,817
Other than those,

428
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,777
you can have nothing

429
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,196
that I do not allow in Arthdal.

430
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,407
But how dare you torture
the father of the high priest?

431
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,492
Are you insane?

432
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,121
The time has finally come
to unify the continent Arth.

433
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,289
But to handle whining people,

434
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,708
I still need Tanya's divine powers.

435
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,502
Even I, the god of Arthdal,

436
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,797
is putting up with Tanya.

437
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,007
But how dare you...

438
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,259
Yes.

439
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,760
Yeolson is yours.

440
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,387
Because you're the king.

441
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,682
Fine, take him.

442
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,355
I'll take him right away.

443
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,191
But...

444
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,945
what should we do about the thing...

445
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,239
in his head?

446
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,579
Over all those years,
in my Bronze Workshop,

447
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,789
in Pilgyeonggwan,

448
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,250
and in the Fortress of Fire!

449
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,670
Incredible knowledge and skills
Yeolson learned and picked up.

450
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,797
Those are all mine.

451
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,259
How can I get those back?

452
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,095
It's just right if I give him back
to you without those.

453
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,263
What should I do?

454
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,223
That's right.

455
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,436
I can kill him.

456
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,149
I'll kill him right now.

457
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,650
Take his body.

458
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,527
That is clearly

459
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,321
yours.

460
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,746
You're going to kill
High Priest Niruha's father?

461
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,830
Why?

462
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,916
Do you think I can't do it?

463
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,834
Since you're going this far,

464
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,586
you must've found out something.

465
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,129
Then think about it.

466
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,883
Do you think I can do it or not?

467
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,927
Fine, do it.

468
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,387
I want to know what happens next.

469
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,182
The people, the ministers,
the White Peak Mountain, and Tanya...

470
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:11,103
I wonder what they'll do to the queen
who killed High Priest Niruha's father.

471
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,689
Kill who?

472
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,744
Since you want to know, I'll tell you.

473
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,956
If my father Yeolson dies
at the hands of the queen,

474
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,291
I, Asa Tanya, in the name of Airuju,

475
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,627
the beginning and the end of the world,

476
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,046
- and the reincarnation of Asa Sin...

477
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,465
Will you curse me, Niruha?

478
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,009
No way.

479
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,262
In the name of the god,

480
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,014
I'll say Prince Arok...

481
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,350
Tanya.
Prince Arok...

482
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,812
will be attacked by the countless lives
his parents took.

483
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,897
That evil will turn into wrath

484
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,274
and that wrath

485
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,235
will reach every people
in Arthdal with children.

486
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,569
So,

487
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,780
every mother and father...

488
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,032
If you wet the Arth Forest with the blood

489
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,867
from Prince Arok's eyes,

490
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,037
your children will live.

491
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,624
If I say that,

492
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,502
someone might stab Prince Arok's eyes.

493
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,839
It might be someone close to you.

494
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,718
A cursed prince won't be able to

495
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,469
succeed Aramun either.

496
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,638
If that happens,

497
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,891
I won't sit still either.

498
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,976
Me too.

499
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,395
If you kill Arok,

500
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,690
do you think I'll just sit by
and do nothing?

501
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,233
Yes, that's right.

502
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,609
So...

503
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,945
if you kill Yeolson,
there'll be a catastrophe.

504
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,532
Let my father go. Instead,

505
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,743
when Prince Arok turns 10,

506
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,244
I will give him divine powers.

507
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,958
Of course, you would have to ask.

508
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,420
Your Highness.

509
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,965
My father will not reveal any knowledge

510
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,842
or skill to the king.

511
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,969
As a scientist, he must know that

512
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,263
that is what's keeping him alive.

513
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,973
He won't reveal it.

514
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,017
What do you want to do?

515
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:17,355
A catastrophe
or Prince Arok's divine power?

516
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,898
One more.

517
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,361
Appoint three people of the Asa Clan
that I choose as Ministers.

518
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,196
THE SACRED CLAN
OF THE WHITE MOUNTAIN TRIBE

519
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,614
What do you want to do?

520
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,701
Instead, I'll remove

521
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:36,916
Hae Heulrip from the bang
of Bronze Affiliation and appoint Yeolson.

522
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,085
Do as you wish.

523
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,169
Everything is settled.

524
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,381
I'll take Yeolson right now.

525
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,892
It feels like I was under your thumb.

526
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,562
What do you mean by that, Niruha?

527
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,106
A TITLE OF HONOR

528
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,941
You told me on purpose.

529
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,109
Did you not?

530
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,735
For me to come here.

531
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,445
Me?

532
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,490
"Even if I killed Yeolson,
I cannot find out the secret."

533
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,325
"Let's get the best out of it."

534
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,494
Am I wrong?

535
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,789
I see. Maybe...

536
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,167
you already know something

537
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,336
about the secret of iron.

538
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,632
Niruha.

539
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,804
It's been a long time
since two of us met alone.

540
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,766
May I give you a piece
of advice like I did before?

541
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:37,768
Go ahead.

542
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,728
You...

543
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,942
are just like Asa Ron.

544
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,610
THE EX-HIGH PRIEST

545
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,362
You're like an old snake.

546
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,659
I don't deserve that praise yet.

547
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,828
Your Highness.

548
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,094
What was the thing that Yeolson hid?

549
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,179
It was charcoal.

550
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,266
And I looked into the powder
he threw away.

551
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,268
It was crushed shells.

552
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,687
Shells?

553
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,606
Shells...

554
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,984
It means it's lime.

555
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,403
We don't know in what ratio they're used

556
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,864
and at what timing yet,

557
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:35,117
but since we found out the ingredients,
it's just a matter of time.

558
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,709
The days of monopoly are over.

559
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,669
It's a competition now.

560
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,796
We need to make better iron.

561
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,632
Everyone.

562
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,509
Put your lives on the line.

563
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,053
Yes, Your Highness.

564
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,523
Why did you choose me?

565
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,485
Even if you have me,
you won't take away my skill.

566
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,948
It's light.

567
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,200
How strong is it?

568
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,743
It's still lacking.

569
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,662
I couldn't make pure iron.

570
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,038
But I will be able to soon.

571
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,123
Something this light will become

572
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,792
stronger than a bronze sword?

573
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,876
Yes.

574
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,754
But its strength isn't
what makes iron swords scary.

575
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,130
It's cheap and common.

576
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,717
If you can arm 1,000 soldiers with bronze,

577
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,553
you can arm 10,000 soldiers with iron.

578
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:39,682
In the Iron Age, tens of thousands
of people will fight in a battlefield.

579
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,101
Only I can do it.

580
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,229
What will you do for me, Your Majesty?

581
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,858
Go meet your daughter.

582
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:56,615
Father.

583
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,163
Yes.

584
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,336
Minister?

585
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,590
I'll become the minister
of the bang of Bronze Affiliation?

586
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,799
Yes.

587
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,467
That's what the king said.

588
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,845
- So if you don't want...
- What do you mean?

589
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,972
It's great.

590
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,141
That means I can have power now.

591
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,393
What power?

592
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,022
Are you going to do politics?

593
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,274
Of course. I should do politics.

594
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,319
I could become like Mihol.

595
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,528
Father.

596
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,990
Mihol was killed
by his daughter in the end.

597
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,826
Niruha. This is Arthdal.

598
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,662
If you don't trample,
you'll get trampled on.

599
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,539
I'm going to trample first.

600
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,125
Father.

601
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,919
What we learned in Iark is for the world--

602
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,671
Stop talking about stuff like that.

603
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,633
We Wahan Tribe is in danger already.

604
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,384
In danger?

605
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,096
Inaishingi.

606
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,891
Eunseom became Inaishingi.

607
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,934
How do you know that?

608
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,479
A few days ago,

609
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,190
Eunseom sent someone.

610
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,736
Come here quickly.

611
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,621
Yakdu. Stay with me.

612
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,293
- What happened?
- I don't know.

613
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,503
He came back like this.

614
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,554
What happened?

615
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,391
Did you not meet Father Yeolson?

616
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,601
I...

617
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,770
I met him.

618
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,939
But...

619
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,153
But? Where's Pungji?

620
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,155
He left with you.

621
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:01,949
He...

622
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,368
He's dead.

623
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,790
I told Mungtae to kill them.

624
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,960
What?

625
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,878
There were two of them. One died,

626
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,506
and one escaped,
but he won't live for long.

627
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,758
Father.

628
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,176
Eunseom

629
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,595
is trying to keep his promise to save us.

630
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,013
Why would he save us?

631
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,182
Eunseom is

632
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,226
the great Inaishingi.

633
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,686
We're at war now,

634
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,521
he's the leader of the enemy,

635
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,398
and he is Lord Saya's benetbeot.

636
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,275
If that comes to light, who knows

637
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,277
what'll happen to us
for keeping it a secret.

638
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,695
So

639
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,406
how can I let those sent
by Eunseom leave alive?

640
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,923
He said all of the Wahan Tribe

641
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,844
was on the same page.

642
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,347
Inaishingi.

643
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,768
The Wahan Tribe...

644
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,021
You don't need to save them.

645
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,201
Lord Saya.

646
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,620
Are you sure?

647
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,707
Yes. I couldn't think carefully
because I was too taken aback.

648
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,584
If I really have a mission,

649
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,753
I should meet him.

650
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,757
Inaishingi isn't my enemy. He's Tagon's.

651
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,008
And...

652
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,470
he is my brother.

653
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,974
We should work together.

654
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,310
Of course.

655
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,562
Of course you should.

656
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,901
Mubaek.

657
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,194
I know it is difficult...

658
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,657
but can you arrange a meeting?

659
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,617
Okay.

660
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,828
I'll arrange it secretly right now.

661
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,248
Two of you are going to meet.

662
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,001
Tanya Niruha would be very happy
if she knew about this.

663
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:38,856
Tanya.

664
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,737
How would it feel like

665
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:50,534
to be betrayed multiple times
by someone whom you've trusted?

666
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,744
Now,

667
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,538
forget it.

668
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,166
YANGCHA

669
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,714
Your mouth was closed for so long.
The first thing you say

670
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,632
is "forget."

671
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,302
How merciless.

672
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,404
You're here, Your Majesty.

673
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,745
Now that Yeolson is dressed

674
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,039
in minister's clothes, he looks decent.

675
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,582
A Wahan Tribe minister.

676
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,628
Consider it a small repayment
for that day, Niruha.

677
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,423
How are you going to use my father?

678
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:47,883
Use him?

679
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,428
I think I'm the one being used.

680
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,805
Yeolson, Dunji, and Mungtae.

681
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,308
All of them used me to make their way up.

682
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,186
That's why all of them changed horribly.

683
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,606
You're the one that changed the most.

684
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,402
You even use Airuju's name
to sell such crude things like this.

685
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,822
You only sell them
to a few and tantalize others.

686
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,117
Does this help
the Great Shrine make a living?

687
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:20,290
I have a lot to do. Why are you here?

688
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,382
You treat slaves and servants too nicely,

689
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,175
so a lot of people feel uncomfortable.

690
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,762
Why is that uncomfortable?

691
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,806
Because that groups them together.

692
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,016
They eat three meals a day,

693
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,018
but their slave eats
three meals a day too.

694
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,687
They don't like that.

695
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,816
Whether it's a slave,
a servant, a bachi, or a merchant,

696
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,402
they're all equal to me.

697
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,154
Yes, they are to me as well.

698
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,074
I don't care
whether you're nice to slaves or not.

699
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,200
But...

700
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,619
to those who had the slightest privilege,

701
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,247
equality is violence.

702
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,291
It's very harsh.

703
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,210
If they're equal to you,

704
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,129
understand how they feel too.

705
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,631
If they live with the power
to look down on others,

706
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:10,799
they'll feel that way.

707
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,968
That's order and balance.

708
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,761
Don't break the balance.

709
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,763
Arthdal is prospering day by day.

710
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,598
On the other side of that prosperity

711
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,475
are Ttesarichon and Gaemakgol.

712
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:23,645
Criminals live in Ttesarichon
and lowly beings live in Gaemakgol.

713
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,981
Those in Ttesarichon are the victims
for your power.

714
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,065
Gaemakgol...

715
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,318
There's no reason

716
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,280
for anyone to live that way.

717
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,285
From now on,

718
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,372
I forbid the Great Shrine from
giving food to the children of slaves.

719
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,832
- That is nonsense.
- Also,

720
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,667
High Priest must not demand anything

721
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,587
to slaves' owners regarding their slaves.

722
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:52,758
Don't go too far with
selling Airuju's name.

723
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,510
Like you've done until now,

724
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,721
I believe you'll understand well.

725
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,640
Due to the long wars,

726
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,435
Arthdal is running out of supplies.

727
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,067
So?

728
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,612
Let me continue
with slave-related matters.

729
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,199
The Great Shrine will give you
10 jars of sorghum...

730
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,079
Ten jars of sorghum?

731
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:23,997
By selling this?

732
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,837
Don't try to strike a deal with me.

733
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,298
That's not enough to strike a deal.

734
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,219
I'll fill up 10 jars of sorghum

735
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,013
with gold.

736
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,267
On top of it, foxtail millet,
sorghum, and barley.

737
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,394
One thousand jars each.

738
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,860
Do you think this is all sold
at the same price?

739
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,404
Those who own a lot

740
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,533
have as much fear as they own.

741
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,662
The king rules with fear
and High Priest rules with kindness.

742
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,914
That's what you said.

743
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,459
But you're not the only one ruling Arthdal

744
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,962
with fear.

745
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:13,922
Your Majesty.

746
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,019
We divided into three
to find a new supply route.

747
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,897
Things won't be good on that side.

748
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:31,982
We have to keep looking.

749
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,028
Inaishingi.

750
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:39,030
An envoy from Arthdal has come.

751
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:46,955
I'll give you a chance.

752
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,708
Inaishingi of the Ago Tribe.
Lead your warriors

753
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,877
and go back to the Agoha Forest.

754
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,295
What?

755
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,714
You make it sound like you've won.

756
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,716
Do you think we'll retreat now?

757
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,926
This is only the beginning.

758
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,970
We're going to invade Arthdal.

759
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,555
Do you think you've won

760
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,725
by burning Geomeuldun
and taking over Hanchoa Castle?

761
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,894
Pyeongmirae, Mobon Castle, and Molabeol.

762
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,229
Arthdal has countless bases like these.

763
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,064
But you guys

764
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,275
can't even get proper supplies in Hanchoa.

765
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:22,657
Did you come all the way here
just to tell us that?

766
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,326
If you're done,

767
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,828
leave while we're letting you.

768
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,583
I want to speak with Inaishingi alone.

769
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,628
No way. Don't do it, Inaishingi.

770
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,755
She's right. He might do something to you.

771
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,719
It's about something puzzling

772
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,139
that Inaishingi saw on the battlefield.

773
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:01,863
Everyone, leave.

774
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,507
Back then,

775
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,343
- what I saw...
- That's right.

776
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:25,720
Your benetbeot.

777
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,306
Your brother.

778
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,817
He is your benetbeot.

779
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,444
The general of the Arthdal army.

780
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,446
Saya.

781
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,783
Do you even know

782
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,286
who you're fighting?

783
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:05,051
Ah! Judging from your face...

784
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,763
You must've met him.

785
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,307
He looks the same, right?

786
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:12,767
My gosh.

787
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,519
How did you know?

788
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,479
Tell me everything you know.

789
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:21,735
Okay. Now we can make a deal, right?

790
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,662
No weapons,

791
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,957
no soldiers.
It's a meeting between you two.

792
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,214
This meeting might change

793
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,259
Arth's history.

794
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,391
I need to tell you

795
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,518
your mission.

796
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,648
Before the mission,

797
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,735
as brothers who were separated
for a long time,

798
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,695
find the way.

799
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,991
When I give you the sign tonight,

800
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,577
kill Inaishingi.

801
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,292
I'll do as you command.

802
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,777
Pretend you didn't see me.
I have somewhere to go.

803
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,577
You startled me.

804
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,996
Why are you in here?

805
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,935
Hey, where are you going?

806
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,031
You are...

807
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:20,997
Over there.

808
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:41,893
Who are you guys?

809
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,186
You shouldn't be here.

810
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:45,730
Kill Saya.

811
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,607
The order will not change.

812
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,843
I'll be at the spring down there.

813
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,178
Meet him comfortably.

814
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,181
We have a lot to talk about too.

815
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:13,401
It is you. The person I saw in my dreams.

816
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,320
That was you.

817
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,904
It really is.

818
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:18,865
You were in my dreams too.

819
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,660
Then did you see

820
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,662
- how I lived?
- Well...

821
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:28,541
You were always trapped
in a tall and small room.

822
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,210
One day,

823
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,755
you lifted the cloth covering the window

824
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:34,922
and looked at the sky.

825
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:38,426
Then you said, "The sky is too blue."

826
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:43,848
And I think you cried.

827
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,224
Ah...

828
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,352
How embarrassing.

829
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,481
I was trapped there unable to do anything.

830
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,400
And another guy found out about it.

831
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,363
But you...

832
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,990
lived very freely.

833
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:02,659
It was fun, right?

834
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,035
You must've only dreamt about

835
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,120
the good stuff.

836
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,290
No. Every dream was faint,

837
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,460
but that dream was vivid.

838
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,754
Gitbadak?

839
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:15,880
Was it Sateunik?

840
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,632
EUNSEOM'S FRIEND
THAT DIED IN GITBADAK

841
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,050
I was sad too.

842
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,385
That was

843
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,804
a very sad dream.

844
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,060
Join the Ago Union.

845
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,691
Do what?

846
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,402
I said, join the Ago Union.

847
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:40,488
- Why should I?
- We can beat Tagon.

848
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,199
At this rate, I don't know about me,

849
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,283
but you'll lose.

850
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,828
What nonsense is that?

851
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,081
You were faint in my dreams too...

852
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,835
but looking back, I understand

853
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,921
what emotions you have for Tagon.

854
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,176
And you

855
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,303
are a defeated general now.

856
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:28,703
Was I too hasty?

857
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:31,622
Then again,

858
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,083
we only met for the first time.

859
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,837
Will we ever get to meet again?

860
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,467
Do you know your name?

861
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,178
Your original name our mother gave.

862
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:49,724
Sometimes, Mother cried all night...

863
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,435
and called out a name.

864
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:56,898
When I think about it,
I think that was your name.

865
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,483
No, it must be you.

866
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,323
What is...

867
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:07,617
my original...

868
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:10,536
name?

869
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:23,090
Who are you?

870
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,230
What is this? Who is Saya?

871
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:50,785
Eunseom.

872
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,162
Run.

873
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:11,973
Get out of here.

874
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,558
Tell Mubaek.

875
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:51,178
Kill Saya.

876
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,806
The order will not change.

877
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,093
- Who is he?
- Shahati.

878
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,013
Was it

879
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:35,932
Taealha?

880
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,483
We need to get out of here.

881
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,309
Asa Hon.

882
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,103
WHITE MOUNTAIN TRIBE,
EUNSEOM AND SAYA'S MOTHER

883
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:25,564
Your necklace.

884
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:29,777
Oh...

885
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,197
Where is it?

886
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,206
I met your children.

887
01:06:58,806 --> 01:06:59,807
Shahati?

888
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,863
Kill Saya.

889
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,615
The order will not change.

890
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:58,908
What?

891
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:00,367
Leave.

892
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:02,286
Why would you come in here?

893
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,790
Darn it.

894
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,335
Where is Nunbyeol?

895
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:54,547
Why are you here?

896
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,007
It's a long story.

897
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,386
Why are you guys here?

898
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:05,933
There...

899
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:21,198
Saya.

900
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,161
Who is he?

901
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,412
Do you know him?

902
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,874
Saya.

903
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:35,212
He is Ragaz's

904
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,381
son.

905
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,013
We need to move him.

906
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,265
Saya.

907
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,561
If something has happened, I'll kill you.

908
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:53,480
General said
he would leave his post for a while.

909
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,149
He said it was nothing important.

910
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,234
But why is that place on fire?

911
01:09:57,234 --> 01:09:58,527
- Darn it.
- Why?

912
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:15,938
Darn it.

913
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,606
Is he in there?

914
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:20,067
Hey, don't say that.

915
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,403
Where is Mubaek?

916
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:32,204
What's that?

917
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,094
General.

918
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,388
Mubaek!

919
01:11:51,598 --> 01:11:53,684
Mubaek!

920
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:56,770
Mubaek.

921
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,274
Mubaek.

922
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:01,859
Mubaek.

923
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:24,882
Mubaek.

924
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:26,425
Mubaek.

925
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,052
Mubaek.

926
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:29,428
Mubaek!

927
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,512
Mubaek.

928
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:32,639
Oh, dear.

929
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:35,184
No. No...

930
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:39,396
Mubaek.

931
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,691
What do we do?

932
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:45,611
Mubaek.

933
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,414
Mubaek.

934
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:14,264
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

935
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,739
You took Mubaek today.

936
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,408
There must be a reason to it.

937
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,534
Mubaek.

938
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:35,244
Just what happened?

939
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,870
Please wake up, Saya.

940
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:39,164
Inaishingi and the general of Arthdal

941
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,916
are benetbeot.

942
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,210
Maybe they were swapped.

943
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,129
If they discover
that Inaishingi's gone,

944
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,339
the Ago Union is done for.

945
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:48,424
You must go back now.

946
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,217
Everyone is so anxious.

947
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,761
Did he get caught?

948
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,305
Saya, don't do this.

949
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:56,932
Stop.
