1
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:49,966
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

2
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,469
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

3
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,678
King Tagon will lose?

4
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,431
I cannot believe it either,
but what if Eunseom wins?

5
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,433
What did they say?

6
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,185
They told me to come with them

7
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,936
- if I was the owner of the necklace.
- Saya?

8
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,606
From the first time we met, until now,
all you did was use me.

9
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,732
- Yes, I did.
- Why did I pretend

10
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,484
that I wanted that world of yours?

11
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,028
And why did I want to become Eunseom?

12
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,030
Your feelings for me. You decided.

13
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,659
As I expected,
the brothers who have left are dangerous.

14
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,582
Who are you?

15
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,666
"Ikomahis."

16
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,212
All forces.
We'll march to Arthdal now.

17
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,506
Now I, Asa Tanya,
the reincarnation of Asa Sin,

18
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,382
wish to open the new sky of Arthdal.

19
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,842
One who continues
the will of Asa Sin...

20
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,927
We'll head to the palace.

21
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,887
Soldiers. Will you live with me

22
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,430
or die in vain?

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,890
What we must not lose

24
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,017
is the future
in the great name of Arthdal.

25
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,687
What you must protect is the future
of our siblings, friends, and children.

26
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,689
Will you follow me, Taealha?

27
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,234
- Will you join me, Asa Tanya?

28
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,653
Follow the reincarnation of Asa Sin!

29
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,488
Whatever you were trying to do,

30
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,573
it will not happen.

31
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,618
It's smoke!

32
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,037
Let's go, descendants of Asa Sin!

33
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,998
Follow the one
who was despised the most.

34
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,166
Niruha,

35
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,919
make the world a good place...

36
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,799
Ago Tribe, retreat and wait for a message.

37
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,092
Why should we retreat?

38
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,303
Who do you think will be next?

39
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:25,270
ARTHDAL CHRONICLES

40
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,071
So you were Inaishingi.

41
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,662
You must be deep in sorrow

42
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,706
because of High Priest Niruha.

43
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,125
I expected that much.

44
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,919
Expecting it
doesn't make the pain go away.

45
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,462
They're two different things.

46
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,547
But...

47
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,507
I'm reassured too.

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,303
Now, Arthdal has nothing left to fight us,

49
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,180
except for debasing themselves to such...

50
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,515
low standards.

51
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,186
I'll give you two days.

52
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,812
Retreat to Molabeol until then.

53
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,357
Up until Molabeol will be
acknowledged as Ago's territory,

54
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,942
and we will send Tanya too.

55
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,319
Why should I do that?

56
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,449
Perhaps when you hold Tanya's severed head
in your hands,

57
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,536
you will wonder why you didn't agree.

58
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,956
You don't have siege weapons.

59
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,752
Your supply line became too long,
and winter is coming soon.

60
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,672
Arthdal Castle will never fall.

61
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:38,009
It is the fortress where all of
my Hae Tribe's technology was used.

62
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,474
I acknowledge the Hae Tribe's technology
from seeing how Hae Kkadak worked.

63
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,893
Hae Kkadak?

64
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,320
Are you planning something
by relying on Hae Kkadak?

65
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,031
You don't think a bachi can decide...

66
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,324
A CRAFTSMAN OR ENGINEER

67
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,492
...how this war ends.

68
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:06,788
Do you?

69
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,252
Does Tagon think the same?

70
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,836
Why didn't he come?

71
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,714
He's the king of Arthdal.

72
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,926
He is way out of the league
of the head of the Ago beasts.

73
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,765
The negotiation...

74
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,229
has failed.

75
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,276
For the first time,
we are seeing eye to eye.

76
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,429
Inaishingi.

77
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,648
FORTRESS OF FIRE

78
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,696
Your Highness.
Hae Kkadak?

79
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,698
I am aware
that Hae Kkadak is helping the Ago.

80
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,782
HAE HEULRIP

81
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,908
But still...

82
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,037
What else, besides iron,
did Hae Kkadak work on?

83
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,163
Gyeokmulsa Hae Kkadak...

84
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,247
SCIENTIST

85
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,707
...worked on various things.

86
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,834
The waterway

87
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,378
from the Arth River
to the Great Gochiju Rock Lake.

88
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,589
Does Hae Kkadak know about it?

89
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,008
But, Your Highness,

90
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,469
that waterway is filled with water now.

91
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,471
Moreover, the waterway is as long as--

92
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,598
Does he know? Hae Kkadak?

93
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,601
He probably knows.

94
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,147
Call Commander Yeonbal.

95
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,482
I understand.

96
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,051
What's going on?

97
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,011
COMMANDER YEONBAL

98
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,221
It's the queen's order.

99
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,972
COMMANDER SODANG

100
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,474
Why here all of a sudden?

101
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,519
She told me to prepare...

102
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,106
just in case.

103
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:51,411
You don't think a bachi can decide
how this war ends...

104
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,678
Inaishingi.

105
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,307
She said she must meet you.

106
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,063
You're amazing. I thought you'd lose.

107
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,274
How are you here?

108
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,358
Did you come alone?

109
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,526
CHAEEUN

110
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,280
Please release
High Priest Niruha!

111
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,740
I, Yeolson, the head of the Wahan Tribe,

112
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,034
the minister
of the bang of Bronze Affiliation,

113
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,912
and the father of High Priest...

114
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,541
beg you with my life.

115
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,171
Please save my poor daughter.

116
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,887
Stop him from talking,
before more people gather.

117
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,307
Please release
High Priest Niruha!

118
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,771
Minister Yeolson
is risking his life

119
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,981
to save you.

120
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,151
- If you just hang on a little--
- No.

121
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,362
Arthdal has already
entered the Iron Age.

122
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:14,702
However, all knowledge and skills needed
to deal with iron are only in here.

123
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,872
So if I die here,

124
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,376
it will be the end of not just me,
but all of the Iron Age.

125
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,837
If you let my daughter live,

126
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,173
I will offer you my everything.

127
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,635
So please save her.

128
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,641
Over there.

129
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,227
It's the king.

130
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,103
It's King Tagon.

131
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,065
King Tagon. It's King Tagon.

132
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,195
Your Majesty.

133
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,836
I gave you everything.

134
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,089
But I lost everything.

135
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,884
You know why I tried so hard...

136
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,762
to gain power.

137
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,265
- Yeolson.
- Even when I made

138
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,351
thousands of iron swords
to protect Arthdal...

139
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,187
I could not protect...

140
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,856
a single one of the poor Wahans.

141
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,237
If I cannot protect my daughter,
who is all I have,

142
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,323
what have I done until now?

143
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,829
How foolish...

144
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,248
and pitiful.

145
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,041
Your Majesty.

146
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,630
I cannot part with Tanya.

147
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,884
As your king, I promise you.

148
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,353
No. You have to stop him.

149
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,314
He said King Tagon would yield to him.

150
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:07,815
No.

151
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,067
The old Tagon might have.

152
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,446
Hurry up and tell my father
not to do anything.

153
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,072
He's probably doing it already.

154
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,162
Can I trust you?

155
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,663
Trust your king.

156
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,459
You will be with your daughter.

157
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,609
Father.

158
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,195
DALSAE

159
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,530
IPSAENG

160
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,200
MIRUSOL

161
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,284
TACHUKAN

162
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,467
What do you mean?

163
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,970
Please kill me.

164
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,179
Tell me.

165
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,931
What did Tagon do?

166
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,182
HAE TRIBE, GYEOKMULSA

167
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,060
The king ordered me to make bichwisan.

168
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,145
- Bichwisan?
- Yes.

169
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,147
POISON THAT'S COLORLESS,
ODORLESS, TASTELESS

170
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,773
- So?
- I made it for him

171
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,151
because he took my child with him.

172
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,447
Suicide.

173
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,825
I understand.

174
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,411
He asked for five jars.

175
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,670
Five jars?

176
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,922
Sorghum jars?

177
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,507
No.

178
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,428
This.

179
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,973
I told him three drops were enough
to kill a person,

180
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,349
and he asked for five jars.

181
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,238
You were together.

182
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,367
Arok.

183
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,037
Can you go out for a minute?

184
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,832
Yes, go out for a minute.

185
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,418
Okay.

186
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,765
Got something to say?

187
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,435
Would you like a drink?

188
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,946
Take the Hae Tribe and Arok, and leave.

189
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,698
Do you think we will lose?

190
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,159
Yes.

191
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,495
We will lose. No.

192
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,580
We've already lost.

193
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,836
Tagon.

194
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:01,298
The warriors from Byeokjido
and the White Mountain Tribe will arrive.

195
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,009
The White Mountain Tribe isn't coming.

196
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,177
What do you mean?

197
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,014
I checked as I was retreating.

198
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,475
After seeing our defeat
in the Arth Forest,

199
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,726
the warriors went back.

200
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,105
The Second Corps of Byeokjido?

201
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,613
They surrendered

202
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,657
to the Ago Tribe.

203
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,785
- They surrendered?
- Yes.

204
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,371
Now, our supplies will get cut off.

205
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,209
We've lost, Taealha.

206
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,794
Then, we should leave together.

207
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,505
Retreat together
and wait for the next chance.

208
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,673
No.

209
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,426
I cannot leave Arthdal.

210
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,635
Why?

211
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,431
I've had a lot of chances to leave Arthdal
since I was seven years old.

212
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,933
You know...

213
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,146
who I killed because
I didn't want to leave Arthdal.

214
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,898
My friends.

215
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,860
When the negotiation
with the Neanthals broke off,

216
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,445
Father told me to leave again.

217
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,780
Who did I kill back then?

218
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,532
The Neanthals in Atturad.

219
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,035
My mother was there too.

220
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,373
So you want to send Arok and me away,
and fight the Ago Tribe alone?

221
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,335
- Yes.
- With five jars of bichwisan?

222
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,380
You already found out?

223
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,382
Tagon, it won't work.

224
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,968
You don't know because you're not a bachi.

225
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,428
The Arth River is very big.

226
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,598
If you release it into the water
that flows to Ago, it'll be diluted.

227
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,268
You may cause some damage,
but you cannot annihilate them.

228
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,106
What if it's Arthdal?

229
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,447
What do you mean? Arthdal?

230
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,033
Not the Arth River,
but inside the castle of Arthdal.

231
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,576
Every well in the castle.

232
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,579
Then, a lot of people will die

233
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,375
and nobody would be able to live here
for a long time.

234
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,544
Why?

235
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,130
Tagon, just why?

236
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,468
I told you
I wouldn't leave Arthdal behind.

237
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,268
We'll disappear together.

238
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,689
Me...

239
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,066
and Arthdal.

240
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,265
Why can't you stab me?

241
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,741
Because I understand you.

242
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,077
Your acknowledgement...

243
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,372
feels good.

244
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,251
Thank you.

245
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,466
THE GREAT GOCHIJU ROCK

246
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,093
Who would even come this way?

247
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,219
- It's useless.
- Quiet.

248
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,388
What's so bad about being prepared?

249
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,934
That's not it. I find this pointless.

250
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,144
It's better to guard the West Gate...

251
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,229
DEPUTY COMMANDER DAESAYI

252
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,322
What's that?

253
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,424
Get in formation and stop them!

254
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,129
HEAD OF THE MOMO TRIBE,
NAMED XABARA

255
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,839
A familiar face has come to visit us.

256
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,740
How did you come so fast?

257
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:04,328
You don't know about
the Momo Tribe's sailing skills.

258
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:09,708
Also, the Momo Tribe's god
sent us the wind.

259
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,550
I, Karika, the Momo Tribe's Xabara,

260
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:24,056
will avenge the death
of my brother, Karat, resolve his galma,

261
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,141
and send him to the Land of Light.

262
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,061
Let's go, warriors of the waters!

263
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,260
But, Your Highness.

264
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,681
It is impossible for anyone
to break in using that waterway.

265
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,849
You said you killed three Momos
in the Arth Forest.

266
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,476
We must be prepared.

267
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,479
Attack!

268
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,862
-  Retreat!
- Retreat!

269
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,668
Unless we pass through here,

270
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,171
we cannot enter the castle, Xabara.

271
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,511
Are they not here yet?

272
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,321
Xabara.

273
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,364
How long will you stay hidden?

274
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:07,576
The Momo Tribe will be annihilated
in Arthdal.

275
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,053
Are they Neanthals?

276
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,304
NUNBYEOL

277
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,555
Seven minutes?

278
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,766
We cannot hold our breaths for that long.

279
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,851
If we pull you,

280
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,270
it will take us less than half of that.

281
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,856
NOSUNAHO - ISSRUV

282
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,776
Attack!

283
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,556
Let's go, warriors of Momo!

284
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,880
Open the gate!

285
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,580
Let's go!

286
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,875
Kneel before Inaishingi!

287
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,390
ROYAL GUARD HEAD GILSEON

288
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,767
Your Majesty, the Momos broke in
via the Great Gochiju Rock

289
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,478
and opened the West Gate.

290
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,646
The Ago army is entering the castle.

291
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,732
- What about the barrier?
- I think it has fallen.

292
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,445
Gather all the troops in the castle
to the front of the military division now.

293
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,739
- Hurry up.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

294
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:58,538
Take Arok and the bachis, and escape via
the secret passage in the Bronze Workshop.

295
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,749
You?
Are you really going to use bichwisan--

296
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,293
There's no way I would do that.
That's bait.

297
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,712
A bait for me to die
with Eunseom and Tanya.

298
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,756
What do you mean, Tagon?

299
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,716
If I can kill those two,

300
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,135
I won't need to use bichwisan.

301
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,220
I have a plan.

302
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,430
Listen carefully.

303
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,140
Ago is different from us.

304
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,517
As long as Eunseom's gone,

305
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,393
the Ago Tribe will be torn into pieces.

306
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,520
No.

307
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,855
They will fight each other over Arthdal.

308
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,733
Watch how the Ago Tribe gets torn apart

309
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,653
and ruins themselves
without Inaishingi and Tanya,

310
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,905
and then return to Arthdal.

311
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,741
I've told Yeonbal and Gitoha too.

312
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,785
Yeonbal and Gitoha's strength,

313
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,328
Arok's legitimacy,

314
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,871
and the Hae Tribe's gyeokmul.

315
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,165
Without Eunseom and Tanya,

316
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,918
you and Arok will take over Arthdal again.

317
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,586
That's why

318
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,797
you killed Yeolson.

319
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,757
Even though it might get delayed,

320
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,677
the best gyeokmul of the continent
must be yours.

321
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,016
This is my last gift to you and Arok.

322
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,768
Tagon.

323
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:08,024
Promise me that you will take over
Arthdal again with Arok.

324
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,276
I promise.

325
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:25,917
COMMANDER GITOHA

326
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,503
If this defense line falls,
it's the end for Arthdal!

327
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,424
We'll fight till our death here today!

328
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,052
Soldiers, draw your swords!

329
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,802
BADORU

330
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,335
They're Neanthals!

331
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,462
They're Neanthals!

332
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,702
Where is Tagon?

333
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,538
- Where is Tagon?
- I don't know.

334
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,206
I don't know anything.

335
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,212
This girl is not Tagon.

336
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,507
Our blue blood

337
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,678
does not hunt with hatred.

338
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,393
The laziest anger in the world is hatred.

339
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,937
So it stretches out everywhere.

340
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,276
In the end, it will turn towards you.

341
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,672
Dalsae.

342
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,716
Take Inaishingi and go save your friend.

343
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,092
Eunseom!

344
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,601
Inaishingi.

345
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,186
We'll take care of things here.

346
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,814
- Dalsae, let's go.
- Okay.

347
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,570
Inaishingi.

348
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,696
Go quickly.

349
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,334
Go quickly, Inaishingi!

350
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,633
YANGCHA

351
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,223
What is it?

352
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,682
Stop him from coming up!

353
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,767
Get him!

354
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,027
WAHAN

355
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,654
Mungtae.

356
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,905
What happened?

357
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,826
Eunseom is here.

358
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,662
Tagon is planning to release
tons of bichwisan in Arthdal.

359
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,081
- Stop that first.
- What? What do you...

360
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,625
Mungtae!

361
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,219
It's Inaishingi!

362
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,132
What's this?

363
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,802
Arthdal is over.

364
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,263
Follow the king's order.

365
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,223
Yeonbal.

366
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,767
- Go quickly.
- Yeonbal.

367
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,185
Go now, you bastard!

368
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,732
Yeonbal.

369
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,749
To the end of what is long.

370
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:04,547
To the bottom of what is deep.

371
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,841
What do you mean?

372
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,218
Where did Prince Arok go alone?

373
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,596
He asked
whether the king was coming with us.

374
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,895
Father.

375
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,035
- He attacked me.

376
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,620
I almost died just now.

377
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,874
Put me down, you beast.

378
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:43,127
Oh!

379
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,842
Warrior of Arthdal, go on your way.

380
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,052
Let's fight next time.

381
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,772
What are you saying? Arok did what?

382
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,732
Please kill me, Your Highness!

383
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,213
Even with one eye,
I can see that it's damn fancy.

384
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,383
This is how Arthdal people lived.

385
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,843
I can't find Tagon.

386
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,302
- We must find him.
- Yes.

387
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,138
He must be in Arthdal anyway.

388
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,183
Is this the king's throne?

389
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,102
Hey, Tachukan!

390
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,564
Gosh, you startled me.

391
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,566
I thought Inaishingi was here.

392
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,402
This bastard...

393
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,863
surrendered.

394
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,283
Huh. You're that guy.

395
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,286
Nice to see you.

396
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,248
I'll relay King Tagon's message
for Inaishingi.

397
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,482
Eunseom.

398
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,194
Tagon

399
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,697
took Tanya.

400
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,866
And

401
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,368
he told me to tell you this.

402
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,162
What is Tagon's message?

403
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,999
Both the High Priest and the king
are in the Great Shrine.

404
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,460
The Great Shrine? Let's go!

405
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,505
Inaishingi is alone!

406
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,594
If you wish to save the High Priest,

407
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,846
Inaishingi must go to
the Great Shrine alone.

408
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,515
If not,

409
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,143
you may conquer Arthdal, but you won't
be able to save the High Priest.

410
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,812
That bastard.

411
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,445
Eunseom, go to the Great Shrine quickly...

412
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,448
and save Tanya.

413
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,367
Hurry.

414
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,835
Mungtae. Eunseom will be here soon.

415
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,919
Sa...

416
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,921
Saya?

417
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,382
It must be hard, but when Eunseom comes,

418
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,093
relay Tagon's message again.

419
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,139
Also, tell him
that I went to save her first.

420
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,651
That day,

421
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,071
if I read your mind correctly,

422
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,991
you're such a sore loser.

423
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,952
A sore loser.

424
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,831
What meaning would it have

425
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,250
to have another name added now?

426
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,919
So?

427
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,631
You'll really do something so horrible?

428
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,472
You still have a chance, Tagon.

429
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,682
No.

430
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,185
I don't have any chances now.

431
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,399
It seems you're the one who got a chance.

432
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,241
We meet again.

433
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,828
Yangcha, no.

434
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:49,248
Your Majesty. I wish to save Niruha.

435
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,461
Yangcha, please don't do this.

436
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,004
Listen to me!

437
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,827
Yangcha!

438
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,963
I told you to listen to me.

439
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:41,384
I told you to leave and run far away.

440
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,010
Why, because of me?

441
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,845
I told you it wasn't.

442
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,014
It's not because of you.

443
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,142
I'm just protecting my emotions.

444
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,519
Yangcha.

445
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,814
I was so scared of dying

446
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:59,568
without emotions, and dying
without even feeling my death.

447
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,196
But, Niruha, look.

448
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,573
I'm shedding tears.

449
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,584
No!

450
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,836
Move aside.

451
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,509
If that really is your plan...

452
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,555
I don't think I should die here.

453
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,854
Is this water really...

454
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,647
Yes, it's bichwisan.

455
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,900
You're seriously insane.

456
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,819
As you're very well aware,

457
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,781
when the water rises up to there,

458
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,574
the floodgate below will open,

459
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:32,286
and bichwisan will flow into all the wells
in Arthdal.

460
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,333
This is your hometown.

461
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,586
It's the Arthdal
that you've cherished and wanted.

462
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,465
It's because I've cherished and wanted it.

463
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,758
But why...

464
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,346
Innocent civilians of this land...

465
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,556
Innocent civilians?

466
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,601
The innocent were Igutus.

467
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,977
MIXED BLOOD BETWEEN SARAM AND NEANTHAL

468
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,521
And Neanthals.

469
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,982
The civilians wanted them wiped out.

470
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,485
So I wiped them out.

471
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,446
I built the sky ladders.

472
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,199
I brought a huge number of slaves
from Iark.

473
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,492
HOME OF THE WAHAN TRIBE

474
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,662
Thanks to that, they enjoyed everything
and prospered.

475
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,747
But now, they're saying...

476
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,500
that I'm a fake.

477
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,710
That I'm a tyrant.

478
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,340
Yes, I trampled on the weak ones.

479
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,842
But...

480
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,345
all the riches the civilians enjoyed
came from that.

481
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,764
The real gosals

482
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,266
are the civilians.

483
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,687
Why are you being quiet?

484
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:44,442
Move that sly tongue and tell me
that your civilians aren't like that.

485
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,360
I know.

486
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,865
I know the civilians aren't good.

487
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:55,619
They're selfish, and sometimes,
they're cruel and full of desires,

488
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,664
but they always think they're right.
I know this.

489
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,249
But...

490
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,628
I also know that they are like water,

491
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,798
so they form different shapes
depending on which bowl they're in.

492
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,385
Maybe they were shaped that way
because they were in the world you made.

493
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,222
It's time to create a new world.

494
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,269
A world that is a good place to live in?

495
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,646
Is that your definition of the new world?

496
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,648
Does that even make sense?

497
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,234
Do you really think that's possible?

498
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,695
I don't know, but I should move...

499
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,615
towards that direction.

500
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:34,909
Yes.

501
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,620
I might become a failed Asa Sin too.

502
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,040
But there is no other way.

503
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,793
Tagon.

504
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,298
This land has a chance now.

505
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,424
Please...

506
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,428
stop.

507
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,309
Tanya.

508
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:05,689
Both lies and false thoughts
were useful to you.

509
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:11,237
Now, read my real thoughts.

510
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,507
Yes. Everything is up to you and Eunseom.

511
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:35,427
- Tagon.
- You and I, and Eunseom.

512
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,221
If the three of us die,

513
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,473
this floodgate won't open.

514
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,354
I wish for it
more desperately than you do.

515
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,462
Yes. You danced while shaking this...

516
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,965
and found the star bell.

517
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,259
Did you use me as bait...

518
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,596
to lure Eunseom here?

519
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,722
Will he come?

520
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:21,849
I'm sure he will.

521
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,518
For him,
everything started because of you.

522
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,562
He'll come to where it all started.

523
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:01,472
I'm glad that Inaishingi came on time.

524
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,559
Eunseom.

525
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,068
I only have one thing to say.
Release Tanya.

526
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,363
I should.

527
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,742
The price of Tanya's life...

528
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,164
is your death.

529
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,167
Eunseom, don't fall for it.

530
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,377
- Tagon is--
No.

531
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,885
This is the price of Tanya's life.

532
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,860
I used medicine to put him to sleep.

533
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,614
He'll wake up before the sun sets.
Of course, only if you release Tanya.

534
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,449
You are the symbol of righteousness.

535
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,576
You would kill a child?

536
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,286
Inaishingi?

537
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,250
You...

538
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,432
No!

539
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,106
What?

540
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,441
Saya is alive?

541
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:39,987
And Tagon is planning to release
a huge amount of bichwisan

542
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,532
into all of Arthdal.

543
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,703
Go save Tanya...

544
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,289
and stop him, Eunseom.

545
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,417
Dalsae, look after Mungtae.

546
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,679
It won't end
with just a wound next time, Tagon.

547
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,391
So, this is the only way?

548
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,249
No negotiations, no conditions.

549
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,544
Release Tanya immediately.

550
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,467
Tanya.

551
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,011
You're the only one I can trust now.

552
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,143
You have no time.

553
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,063
You'll have to run.

554
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,191
Tanya, leave now.

555
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,723
Inaishingi, you lost.

556
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,017
The Ago Union will now be torn

557
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,562
into 30 pieces.

558
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,694
Break Mirror first.

559
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,739
The day when Mirror reflects Sword
will be the end of your world.

560
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,607
Where is Tanya?

561
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:23,533
Tanya is safe.

562
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,453
I helped her escape.

563
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,264
Thank you.

564
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,725
Get treated. I'll join you soon.

565
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,712
Do you think you've won?

566
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,631
We

567
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,175
both lost.

568
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,596
What are you saying?

569
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,891
Bichwisan.

570
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,643
Why do you think...

571
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,148
I released

572
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,526
Tanya?

573
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,538
Niruha!

574
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,002
Tanya!

575
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,880
Find Tanya.

576
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,841
Search all around the Great Shrine now!

577
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,968
Yes, Inaishingi!

578
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,513
Tanya.

579
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,146
Tanya.

580
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,314
What...

581
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,316
Eunseom.

582
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,276
There was no other way.

583
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,291
In this long battle,

584
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,043
only you, Tanya...

585
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,087
have won.

586
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:46,301
You saved Arthdal.

587
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,764
Thank you, Tanya.

588
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,439
I'll kill him.

589
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,736
Eunseom, there's no time.

590
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:08,907
We have something to do
before my time runs out.

591
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,659
You read my letter. Right?

592
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,952
You know what it is.

593
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,789
What does something like that
have to do with me?

594
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,958
What are you saying?

595
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,043
It's as you've heard.

596
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,670
Tanya soaked herself
in bichwisan to save Arthdal...

597
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,842
I have to go too.

598
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,011
I have to go too!

599
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,264
Are you okay?

600
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:34,849
Let me go.

601
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,103
Let me go!

602
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,314
I said, let me go.

603
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,524
Let go!

604
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,159
EKNAD

605
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,954
I will take him.

606
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,206
There's no time.

607
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,125
Hurry up.

608
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,626
No.

609
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,545
You do have a bit of time.

610
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,299
You can trust me.

611
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,304
Bichwisan is made by us, the Hae Tribe.

612
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,425
Tagon.

613
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,135
Taealha.

614
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:54,596
You did...

615
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,932
your very best.

616
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,396
I'm sorry.

617
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,865
Our...

618
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,910
Our son, Arok.

619
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,665
I'll save him.

620
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,376
You...

621
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,011
I'll take care of everything now.

622
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,516
Rest...

623
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,310
now.

624
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,394
Thank...

625
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,105
Thank...

626
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,608
Thank you.

627
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:45,915
You still have a chance.

628
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,962
This is the antidote for bichwisan.

629
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,132
What I want is something simple.

630
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,885
I'll take Arok and get out of here.

631
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,015
That's ridiculous. How can we trust you?

632
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,641
I risked my life to come here.

633
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,312
It's up to Inaishingi
whether he trusts me or not.

634
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,188
Can she live...

635
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,150
for sure?

636
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,569
She has an even chance.

637
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,697
If I wanted to fool you,
I would've said it was for sure.

638
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,449
If you refuse, I'll pour it out.

639
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:23,494
Then Arok, Tanya, and I.

640
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,246
All three of us will be done for.

641
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,999
Eunseom, please.

642
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,794
My life isn't important.

643
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,839
Let's do it before it's too late. Come on.

644
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:40,845
I'll accept it

645
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,473
in the name of Inaishingi.

646
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,391
Inaishingi!

647
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,153
King Tagon...

648
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,447
is dead.

649
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,328
King Tagon is dead.
King Tagon is dead.

650
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,004
King Tagon is dead.

651
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:59,340
With King Tagon's demise,

652
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:03,219
I plan to end this fight
and all this death.

653
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,557
The Ago Tribe will not take,

654
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,351
and Arthdal will not be taken away.

655
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,562
It is Inaishingi's benevolence.

656
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,355
It is Inaishingi's benevolence.

657
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,607
Benevolence.
Benevolence.

658
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,528
What is this?

659
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,826
He's lying!

660
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,037
We may have lost the war,

661
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,790
but we cannot kneel
before these dirty beasts!

662
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:34,959
That is right!

663
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,544
We're all Sarams of Arthdal.

664
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:40,339
Even if you kill us,
our hearts will not die!

665
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,800
We may die today,

666
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,303
but our hearts will survive until the end

667
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,097
and strangle your necks!

668
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:49,724
That is right!

669
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:53,311
Beasts of Ago, kill me first!

670
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,979
I'll die hating you!

671
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,231
We hate you!

672
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:00,318
Kill me!
We hate you!

673
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,322
Kill me!
We hate you!

674
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,869
Kill me!
We hate you!

675
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:11,788
We hate you!

676
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,252
Fear is the seed of hatred.

677
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,675
Abandon your fear.

678
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:37,313
Abandon your fear
and take back your hatred, my people.

679
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,273
It's High Priest Niruha.

680
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,817
Niruha?

681
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,694
I heard her too.

682
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:47,907
Did you hear that?

683
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,167
Tanya.

684
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,462
It's High Priest Niruha.

685
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,465
It's High Priest Niruha.

686
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:06,175
Niruha.

687
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,268
We destroyed everything
we were afraid of.

688
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,980
We hated everything we were afraid of.

689
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,567
We looked down on everything
we were afraid of.

690
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:28,030
And we persecuted everything
we were afraid of.

691
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,576
We did so with Neanthals,

692
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:33,911
Igutus,

693
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:39,750
Sarams of Iark, the Ago Tribe,
and countless strangers.

694
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,670
So for many years...

695
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:48,718
tears made up a stream
and blood flowed like a river.

696
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:55,141
When you drink the antidote,
you will fall into a deep sleep.

697
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:03,983
Do not fight it, Tanya.

698
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:16,746
Therefore, Aramun came

699
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,415
as an Igutu.

700
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,042
Therefore, Asa Sin went...

701
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,877
ARTHDAL'S LEGENDARY SACRED MOTHER

702
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,086
...to Iark.

703
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:26,380
Therefore, Airuju is going to...

704
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,216
entrust Arthdal to a stranger.

705
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,849
Let me ask you. Who are you?

706
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:52,615
I am the son of Ragaz,
a warrior of Neanthal,

707
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:56,702
and the son of Georukmihon
of the Asa Clan of Arthdal.

708
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:59,580
I saw that in the mural.

709
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,416
I'm Eunseom of the Wahan Tribe of Iark.

710
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:05,920
I'm Purple,
an Igutu slave of Gitbadak, Doldambul.

711
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:10,800
I'm the stranger who survived
the judgment of the waterfall, Inaishingi.

712
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,302
Will you

713
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,806
treat people of Arthdal and Ago equally,

714
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:21,477
cherish them,
look after them, and protect them?

715
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,731
Am I a Neanthal or of the Asa Clan?

716
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:28,651
Am I a Wahan, an Ago, or an Igutu?

717
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,654
Can I be distinguished?

718
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:36,283
I will not distinguish anyone.
I shall cherish them, look after them...

719
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:39,745
and protect them.

720
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:41,789
I promise.

721
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:53,592
Do you promise not to take away
any of Arthdal's faith,

722
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,929
and make a world where anyone can believe

723
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,764
in any god they want?

724
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,475
I will make that world. I promise.

725
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,355
Will you...

726
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:09,358
build a future

727
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:13,404
where everyone works towards
making the world a better place?

728
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,742
I will build that future
with all my heart.

729
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,119
I promise.

730
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,586
Now, I ask the people of Arthdal.

731
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,254
He has made his promise.

732
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:34,008
If he does not keep his word,

733
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:37,053
will you drag him down, chew on his flesh,

734
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,512
and drink his blood?

735
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,016
I will!

736
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,062
I will chew his flesh and drink his blood.

737
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:47,897
I promise!

738
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,942
I promise!

739
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:55,946
I promise!

740
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:02,536
The year of the hungry snake,
the month of the hawk.

741
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,121
In the name of Airuju,

742
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:09,293
all the spirits you believe in,
and all the gods,

743
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:12,505
a sacred promise has been made.

744
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,382
He will rule Arthdal and--

745
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:17,426
The only person
that can rule Arthdal

746
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,013
is Aramun Haesulla.

747
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:25,684
No matter what promise he makes,
there is no truth beyond this.

748
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:28,646
Everyone...

749
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:33,901
remembers the prophecy
of the sword of Aramun.

750
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:37,279
Is he the owner of the sword of Aramun?

751
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:40,658
If he is not the owner
of the sword of Aramun...

752
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:41,742
CHOJAHA

753
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,244
he can never become Aramun Haesulla.

754
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:40,176
The patterns connect.

755
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,468
It's the same pattern.

756
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,429
He's the owner
of the sword of Aramun!

757
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:46,473
He's Aramun Haesulla!

758
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:50,561
He's Aramun Haesulla!

759
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,318
We have a new king!

760
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,695
Aramun Haesulla.

761
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:10,414
It's the blessing of Airuju.

762
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,542
Aramun.

763
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,419
Aramun Haesulla.

764
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,686
Aramun Haesulla!

765
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,282
Do not be fooled by the cheers.

766
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:50,120
Winning their hearts starts now.

767
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,081
Taealha told you...

768
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,292
not to fight off the sleep.

769
01:10:57,544 --> 01:10:59,171
Tanya, please.

770
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:00,839
Do you trust Taealha?

771
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,091
After about 30 minutes,

772
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,677
you'll fall into a deep slumber.

773
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:09,098
Nobody knows when you'll wake up from
the dream, or what will happen

774
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:10,975
when you wake up.

775
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:13,686
It's God's will from there.

776
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:14,770
For now...

777
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,815
I trust Taealha more desperately...

778
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,277
than any other god in the world.

779
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:23,737
Tanya.

780
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:25,322
It's okay.

781
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:32,288
I can go.

782
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:35,708
A god...

783
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,252
does not fall.

784
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,676
The god fell asleep.

785
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:33,057
And Nunbyeol left.

786
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,658
The reincarnation
of Aramun Haesulla...

787
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:53,494
Eunseom did not rest.

788
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:54,578
However,

789
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:57,456
although he worked without resting,

790
01:12:57,456 --> 01:13:00,042
the world did not change
as fast as he hoped.

791
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,838
He looked for Saya without resting,

792
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,383
but he could not find him anywhere.

793
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:18,644
He looked after Tanya
for the long time she was asleep,

794
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:22,981
but the god's eyes were still firmly shut.

795
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:39,081
What's wrong with giving the hahos
as much grains...

796
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,165
ARTHDAL'S LOW STATUSES

797
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:41,291
...as they've worked?

798
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:43,752
Still, ten jars of barley are too much.

799
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,004
Even the workhouse
in Atturad doesn't give...

800
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,008
Let's make a law.

801
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,970
It's been more than a year
of sleepless nights

802
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,638
to make eight prohibitive laws.

803
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:57,015
We just managed
to finish it recently.

804
01:13:57,015 --> 01:14:00,060
What else do you want
to prohibit, Your Majesty?

805
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:02,020
It's not a law that prohibits.

806
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,398
It's a law about what we must do.

807
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:10,737
The civilians will do
what they need to do on their own.

808
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:12,448
No.

809
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:14,533
Not the civilians.

810
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,286
We'll make a law about what we must do.

811
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:44,938
I'm sorry.

812
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,901
I gave you too big of a burden.

813
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:52,905
It's okay.

814
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,073
I'm your dream.

815
01:14:55,741 --> 01:15:00,746
That is the name you gave me,
and that was the promise I made.

816
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,372
Yes.

817
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:05,876
You kept your promise.

818
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,755
You came back to me and became my dream.

819
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:13,383
Promise me too.

820
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:15,427
Promise?

821
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,679
That you'll wake up no matter what.

822
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,266
That this isn't the end.

823
01:15:23,727 --> 01:15:26,146
We finally
got to be together, Tanya.

824
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:40,994
Promise me now.

825
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:42,871
I...

826
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:47,459
promise.

827
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,981
It's Irkebaek.

828
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,332
It's been a long journey.

829
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:54,711
We'll arrive in Irkebaek soon.

830
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,633
Do you resent me?

831
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:08,892
Do you still want to go back to Tanya?

832
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:12,354
Tanya...

833
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:19,653
is dead.

834
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:26,243
You can never know with bichwisan.

835
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,787
We'll meet the Father God now.

836
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:32,499
He'll ask what you want. What do you want?

837
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:42,342
What?

838
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,105
Arthdal.

839
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:44,446
It's a chronicle about Arthdal.

840
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:48,074
Why are you writing this?

841
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:52,329
What do you think makes a country?

842
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:00,545
Swords, land, and Sarams, right?

843
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:06,426
There's something more important
than those.

844
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:12,974
Your Majesty.

845
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,812
The preparation for the war is complete.

846
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:18,730
Shall we go?

847
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:27,364
What's more important in making a country?

848
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:32,786
A story.

849
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,832
A country is made with a story.

850
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:44,089
I did not know that before.

851
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:50,804
But it's a story
about someone else's land far, far away.

852
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,641
I'll get it back.

853
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:56,685
Arthdal.

854
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:25,797
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN
