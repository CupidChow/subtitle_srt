1
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:49,966
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

2
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,637
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

3
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,223
Eunseom of the Wahan Tribe,
Saya's benetbeot,

4
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,768
and Inaishingi. All of them

5
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,188
- were you?
Also,

6
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,107
I'll become the reincarnation
of Aramun Haesulla with Kanmoreu.

7
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,901
It is said that long ago,

8
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,737
hundreds of winters ago,

9
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,822
there were brothers who got separated,

10
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,116
I think they're back.

11
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,910
Brother of promise?

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,872
How am I alive?

13
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,207
Why are there two of them?

14
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,334
Is Aramun a benetbeot?

15
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,752
Isn't this about Eunseom?

16
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,879
Pretend you don't know.
We don't know anything.

17
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,047
She's still alive.

18
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,548
Move her quickly. Now!

19
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,013
Who are you?
High Priest Niruha

20
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,723
wishes for you to escape.

21
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,391
Arthdal will collapse.

22
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,937
King Tagon wishes to meet you.

23
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,397
What do you want from us?

24
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,817
Hand over Suhana and Kanmoreu.

25
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,237
Then I will open up the way
and hand over your subordinates too.

26
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,156
Tagon has no intention of
clearing the way for us.

27
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,492
Fire attack. Is that what you mean?

28
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,619
We'll attack with fire
from the other side.

29
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,543
Helper!

30
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,836
Stop, Tagon!

31
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:24,477
HEROINES

32
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,859
Run away!

33
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,402
We have to go. Run.

34
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,255
Your Majesty!

35
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,344
We must escape from the flames. Stand up!

36
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,346
Now!

37
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,900
Your Majesty.

38
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,027
It's the whirlwind fire.

39
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:08,081
Niruha, did you get an answer?

40
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:13,628
Moa. Did you pass the message
to the Whisper Organization?

41
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,505
Yes, Niruha.

42
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,675
"When you hear that King Tagon has lost,
get ready.

43
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,386
"Move when smoke rises
from the Great Shrine."

44
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,429
I told them so.

45
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,519
What about Father Yeolson?

46
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,937
Yes, Niruha.

47
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,272
He's in the Iron Workshop.

48
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,275
Excuse me, Niruha.

49
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,485
Will King Tagon really lose?

50
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,620
Everything will be decided by Airuju.

51
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,914
...decided by Airuju.

52
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,542
Niruha.

53
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,173
Before tonight ends,

54
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,885
I need to meet someone in secret.

55
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,057
YANGCHA

56
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,563
Niruha.

57
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,316
Why did you come back?

58
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,859
Don't you know

59
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,736
why I sent you to Eunseom?

60
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,363
I passed along everything

61
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,533
you ordered me to.

62
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,244
No. I sent you to him to save you.

63
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,165
I sent you there to meet your mother
and go far away.

64
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,292
Mother sent me back.

65
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,627
- Why?
- She saw that

66
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,421
my emotions came back.

67
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,641
I was a Child of Shahati

68
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,561
and I grew up as a Black Tongue.

69
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,273
I received horrible trainings,
took medicines,

70
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,400
and smelled strange scents.

71
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,736
As a result,
my emotions disappeared day by day.

72
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,614
King Tagon was the one who saved me.

73
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,868
I escaped that place
and met my mother again,

74
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,411
but I could not feel anything.

75
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,207
Resentment, sorrow, nor affection.

76
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,417
I couldn't feel anything.

77
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,088
But one thing remained.

78
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,594
The memory that I once had emotions.

79
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:32,100
Children of Shahati die at a young age
during their missions.

80
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,727
Even if they survive and become adults,

81
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,980
most of them commit suicide

82
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,359
because they remember having emotions.

83
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,445
I was the same. I always wanted to die.

84
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,407
But thanks to you,

85
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,660
I found my emotions again.

86
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,162
Don't try to protect me.

87
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,206
No. It's not you.

88
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,917
I'm trying to protect

89
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,044
the emotions that I got back.

90
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,800
Niruha, you must leave now.

91
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,181
Something big is going
to happen tomorrow.

92
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,225
If you get the chance, leave.

93
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,063
The emotions you got back with difficulty
will be of use somewhere else.

94
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,366
What do you mean?

95
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,910
King Tagon will lose?

96
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,163
Arthdal will lose?

97
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,332
Is that what Niruha said?

98
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,252
What is she planning now?

99
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,045
I cannot believe it either...

100
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,464
YEOLSON

101
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,299
...but that's what Tanya said.

102
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,675
We have way more troops.

103
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,095
Moreover, their iron swords
are not as good as ours.

104
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,180
Still,

105
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,764
what if Eunseom wins?

106
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,143
What will you do?

107
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,898
If that happens, we must do it.

108
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,024
No,

109
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,485
even if Niruha stops us,
I'm going to do it.

110
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,069
But...

111
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,156
is it possible?

112
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,120
Let's fight together.

113
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,457
Tagon is the enemy of all of us.

114
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:24,003
How many bears and tigers
will think of us as their enemies?

115
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,760
NOSUNAHO

116
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,931
Nature does not take revenge.

117
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,349
It just circulates.

118
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,019
Even if you don't take revenge,
in the end,

119
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,689
Mother Nature will take Tagon back
to the earth.

120
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:49,654
Look at how many of us are left
because of that mindset.

121
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,698
Sarams took revenge,

122
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,660
so they prospered and won.

123
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,955
We lost miserably.

124
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:03,459
Living with Sarams has only made you
think about winning and losing.

125
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,878
My answer remains the same.

126
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,964
I am not going.

127
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,298
Nosunaho too, of course...

128
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,807
I'm going.
Why?

129
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,476
I like

130
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,644
that girl.

131
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:28,109
If it's to continue our blue bloodline
that has been cut off...

132
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,487
No. That's not it.

133
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:36,284
I just like her. I want to be with her.

134
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,453
You should come with us too.

135
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,498
I'm not asking you to fight with us.

136
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,500
Help me.

137
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,964
Or I'll tell Rottip

138
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:54,510
that you've been repeating his ideas
as if they were your own.

139
00:09:56,304 --> 00:10:00,725
How many bears and tigers
will think of us...

140
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,939
as their enemies?

141
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,944
GAMBAL MOUNTAIN

142
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,488


143
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,619
Is Saya dead?

144
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,703
That is right.

145
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,331
Tagon didn't allow them to hold a funeral

146
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,249
and had the body thrown here.

147
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,377
ROTTIP

148
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,212
Just where did Saya go?

149
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,717
To meet the High Priest, probably.

150
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,053
This is crazy. If someone sees him...

151
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,056
He knows all the secret passages,

152
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,140
so it should be fine.

153
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,434
Should I bring him back?

154
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,020
No, that's too dangerous.

155
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,398
We must go to the White Peak Mountain
before Tagon returns.

156
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,484
Get ready and meet me in Gitgang.

157
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,361
I understand.

158
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,826
Saya is alive?

159
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,997
What will you do now?

160
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,457
I must find Saya.

161
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,875
And...

162
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,086
them, too.

163
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,922
Give me what I asked for.

164
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,635
I hope you find him.

165
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,261
If it ends well, let me know.

166
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,180
If I don't hear from you,

167
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,265
I'll assume you're dead.

168
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,704
A Neanthal?

169
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,290
I do not wish to fight you.

170
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,545
I just wish to know.

171
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,719
Is Saya alive?

172
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,512
Saya?

173
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,050
Nice to meet you, child of Asa Hon.

174
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,347
You've already met them?

175
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,932
That was your goal.

176
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,059
I thought

177
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,977
you came to tell me about my mother.

178
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,355
What did they say?

179
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,114
They told me to come with them
if I was the owner of this necklace.

180
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:50,621
They told me to meet them in the White
Ford Forest when the next new moon rises.

181
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,501
Are you going?

182
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,170
I'm not sure.

183
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,091
Now that I'm dead, I can go anywhere.

184
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,134
But I'm not sure

185
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,971
where to go

186
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,223
or who to live as.

187
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,517
Am I even the owner of this?

188
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,609
It was nice meeting you, child of Asa Hon.

189
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,113
Why didn't Asa Hon...

190
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,993
my mother...

191
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,372
stop Tagon from taking me?

192
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,583
Was she afraid?

193
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,543
Or...

194
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,881
was Eunseom more precious?

195
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:52,474
Everyone lives in the world they choose.

196
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,937
Who knows what Asa Hon was thinking
at that time?

197
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,149
You decide.

198
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,445
Of course,
you don't have to decide your past

199
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,407
to be a painful one.

200
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,037
The same goes for the future.

201
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,872
Decide for yourself.

202
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,082
Decide how you want to live,

203
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,668
who you want to live as...

204
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,924
and if you want to be its owner.

205
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,471
Only with your intention and will.

206
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,501
Saya?

207
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,683
Saya, what happened? You were alive?

208
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,687
The murals all over Arthdal
were your doing, right?

209
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,021
What are you trying to do?

210
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,484
Yes.

211
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,112
You're not a gosal.
It's fine as long as you're alive.

212
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,155
Eunseom was born,

213
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,949
went to Iark,

214
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,244
and met Asa Sin and Kanmoreu there.

215
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,453
HORSE RIDDEN BY ARAMUN

216
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,581
What were you planning to do
by making murals of how he lived?

217
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,792
When Tagon loses,

218
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,712
I will take control of Arthdal myself.

219
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,089
Tagon will lose?

220
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,590
He might've already lost.

221
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,592
Then where is the messenger?

222
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,636
They were so crushed

223
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,805
that they couldn't even send a messenger.

224
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,015
So,

225
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,852
you want to take over Arthdal
and give it to Eunseom

226
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,729
by turning Inaishingi into Aramun?

227
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,899
Then why did you add me in the murals?

228
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,526
Why?

229
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,488
- Saya.
- Ever since the beginning...

230
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,450
From the first time we met, until now...

231
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,328
all you did was use me.

232
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,210
Yes, I did.

233
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,256
At first, I used you,

234
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,883
but now, I'm using Eunseom too.

235
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,926
Is Eunseom the only one?

236
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,262
I'm using young slaves
that follow me like a god,

237
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,474
and poor people who will end up
getting hurt and dying in the end.

238
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,768
I'm using all of them.

239
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,397
Is it such a big deal for someone like me

240
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,484
- to use you?
- Why?

241
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,568
For what?

242
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,864
Do you think a world where people don't
fight or kill will come because of that?

243
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,659
Not a world where people don't fight,
kill, steal, or get robbed.

244
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,704
I want to make a world less strenuous

245
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,501
where people fight less, kill less,
steal less, and get robbed less.

246
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,960
But why must it be Eunseom?

247
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,755
- I...
- You...

248
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:15,135
If the rebellion succeeded, you were going
to kill Eunseom and take his place.

249
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,472
You wanted to become Eunseom.

250
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,433
Ever since you told me,

251
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,685
I read your thoughts.

252
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,982
From the beginning,
the world we were going to make...

253
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,067
Fine.

254
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,986
I wasn't interested. Don't you know me?

255
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,449
I killed Danbyeok without hesitation,
divided Taealha and Tagon,

256
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,326
and threw Arthdal into confusion.

257
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,538
Chaos, confusion! That's who I am.

258
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,165
Didn't you know?

259
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,876
Why did someone like me pretend that

260
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,587
I wanted that world of yours?

261
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,881
And why...

262
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,802
did I want to become Eunseom?

263
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,806
And why

264
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,516
did I drink bichwisan...

265
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,312
without hesitation

266
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,231
instead of begging Tagon for my life?

267
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,483
It's all for the same reason.

268
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,902
The reason that you know

269
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,029
very well.

270
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,699
That one reason.

271
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,461
Your feelings for me.

272
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,339
You decided...

273
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,552
to want me.

274
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,013
You made that choice.

275
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,640
It is your intention and will.

276
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,892
Decide for yourself.

277
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,812
Decide how you want to live,
who you want to live as...

278
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,524
and if you want to be its owner.

279
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,363
You decided...

280
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,948
to want me.

281
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,784
You made that choice.

282
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,372
You decide
how your story in the mural ends.

283
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,291
Tell me.

284
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,335
I'll be waiting.

285
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,063
Where are you coming from?

286
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,817
Are you Arthdal's soldiers?

287
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,990
Where are you coming from?

288
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,786
Answer me. What happened?

289
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,746
Can't you tell?

290
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,083
Arthdal's troops lost.

291
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,086
We prepared a fire attack,

292
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,755
but Inaishingi attacked us from behind.

293
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,342
What about King Tagon?

294
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,427
I don't know.

295
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,512
We don't even know if he's alive or not.

296
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,725
That bastard, Saya,
was on their side in the first place.

297
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,895
He was Inaishingi's benetbeot
with the same face.

298
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,268
Inaishingi.

299
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,156
- Your eye.
It's nothing.

300
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:50,327
A warrior must have two legs,
they're lucky if they have two arms,

301
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,245
and two eyes is one too many.

302
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,207
Rather, now that I only see half,
I'm not scared of anything.

303
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,712
Above all,
his mouth is working well, Inaishingi.

304
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,762
All forces.

305
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,058
We'll march to Arthdal now.

306
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,018
Yes, Inaishingi.

307
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,940
Arthdal lost!

308
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,441
Inaishingi won!

309
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,320
- Inaishingi won.

310
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,571
King Tagon lost!

311
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,665
We lost?

312
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,543
Yes. Inaishingi set fire at the rear,

313
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,170
and the wind was strong.

314
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,756
What about the king?

315
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,510
What happened to the king?

316
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,803
We do not know

317
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,639
whether he's alive or dead.

318
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,561
It will only take them a day or two

319
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,521
to reach Arthdal.

320
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,024
Moreover, Inaishingi
and the traitor, Saya,

321
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,693
were benetbeot brothers.

322
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,083
Arthdal lost?

323
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,794
How does this make sense?

324
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,339
Minister.

325
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,051
We must prepare just in case.

326
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,263
We must be prepared.

327
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,099
Whether the king is alive or not
remains unclear,

328
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:39,769
so your safety means
everything to Arthdal.

329
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,356
I will prepare for you
to leave Arthdal for a while.

330
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,568
Where can I go, Minister?

331
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,572
For now, the White Peak Mountain
is the only option.

332
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,117
The White Mountain Tribe

333
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,245
hates my father and me.

334
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,458
When there's a storm,

335
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:05,212
even the worst enemies
have to row together.

336
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:09,132
In this case, the White Mountain Tribe
know of your importance

337
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,759
more than anyone.

338
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,720
They will definitely join hands with us.

339
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,143
Release my mother.

340
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,729
Since we don't know if Father's alive,

341
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,273
chaos in Arthdal will grow uncontrollably.

342
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,859
Mother is the only person left

343
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,110
to subdue that chaos.

344
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,574
- But the queen...
- Since there's a storm,

345
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,410
we must row together to survive.

346
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,703
But Prince Arok.

347
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,624
It seems that the queen has escaped
from Arthdal.

348
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,539
The one who continues
the will of Asa Sin...

349
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,083
Shall become Asa Sin themselves.

350
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,670
Now I, Asa Tanya,
the reincarnation of Asa Sin,

351
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,214
wish to open the new sky of Arthdal.

352
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,011
Let us...

353
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,388
begin.

354
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,100
The Ago Tribe is coming.

355
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,643
King Tagon lost.

356
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,648
The Ago Tribe is coming.

357
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,733
King Tagon lost.

358
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,277
DOTI

359
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,865
What happened to the king?

360
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,366
I don't know.

361
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,784
You really don't know?

362
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,662
Is it true that Inaishingi
and General Saya are benetbeot?

363
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,164
I said don't know!

364
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,813
I relay the will of Asa Sin.

365
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,819
The one who continues
the will of Asa Sin...

366
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,404
Shall become Asa Sin themselves.

367
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,045
The whole of Arthdal is in complete chaos.

368
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:56,174
And they say Inaishingi has the same face
as the traitor, Saya.

369
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,718
They're benetbeot. Is this true?

370
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,137
Even that rumor has spread?

371
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,305
So it's true?

372
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,227
At this rate, we'll fall
even before the Ago beasts arrive.

373
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,814
I'll go to the palace to discuss
countermeasures with the ministers.

374
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,816
Wait. Then,

375
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,901
the king passing away...

376
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,322
You bastard. How dare you run your mouth?

377
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,116
I apologize.

378
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,371
- Watch your mouth.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,754
Minister.

380
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,812
Sir, sir.

381
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,397
Sir.

382
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,033
Is the Royal Guard Head not around?

383
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,537
He went to the palace.

384
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,247
I see.

385
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,458
Excuse me.

386
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,628
Wait.

387
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,673
What are you doing?

388
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,050
All guards are on duty.

389
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,386
Which department

390
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,263
are you in?

391
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,190
Let's go.

392
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,399
Minister!

393
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,778
Minister Jeungsugae

394
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,738
was attacked in the marketplace.

395
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,448
- What?
- He's in critical condition.

396
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,699
What do you mean?

397
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,952
Prince Arok, please wait for a while.

398
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,998
- Protect Prince Arok.
- Yes, sir.

399
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,082
Let's go.

400
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,465
Gosh.

401
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,515
What is this?

402
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,200
How are you...

403
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,827
How am I here?

404
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,412
Why didn't I go
to the White Peak Mountain?

405
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,997
So that was Tanya's plan.

406
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,500
It's easier to do things
without me in Arthdal,

407
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,919
so she told you to help me escape.

408
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,045
Right?

409
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,431
Right, I forgot to say this last time,

410
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,892
but thank you

411
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,602
- for saving me.
Your Highness.

412
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,729
What is happening?

413
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,276
Wrap yourself with that.

414
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,779
Get a hold of yourself.

415
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,739
We have to protect it. Follow me.

416
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,907
Protect what?

417
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,037
Arthdal.

418
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,835
What did Niruha say?

419
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,546
Niruha said this.

420
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,466
"Asa Tanya will open
the new sky of Arthdal."

421
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,451
The one who continues
the will of Asa Sin...

422
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,536
The one who continues
the will of Asa Sin...

423
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,709
Shall become Asa Sin themselves.

424
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,210
We'll head to the palace.

425
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,671
Yes, descendant of Asa Sin.

426
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,687
THE WAHAN TRIBE

427
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,030
BAKRYANGPUNG

428
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,450
High Priest Niruha

429
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,494
left the Great Shrine with armed forces.

430
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,121
Just what is this?

431
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,458
Where are Ministers
Chojaha and Jeungsugae?

432
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,378
Minister Jeungsugae is dead.

433
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,547
He was murdered in the marketplace.

434
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,300
Just what is happening?

435
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,346
Royal Guard Head, you must go.

436
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,474
Bachis, merchants,
vice-ministers, scribes,

437
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,352
and even civilians have gathered
looking for you.

438
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,813
You must go out and calm them down.

439
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,649
- Tell them to go back.
Royal Guard Head.

440
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,526
You must take care of it.

441
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,194
Give us your orders now.

442
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,242
Take the Second Corps
and stop the High Priest right now.

443
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,035
Do not let her come to the palace.

444
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,120
Yes, sir.

445
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,501
I'll go to the military division.

446
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,837
What happened?

447
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,589
You should tell us so we can decide
whether to evacuate or not.

448
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,260
Is the king alive or dead?

449
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,512
Was the Third Corps really annihilated?

450
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,849
Currently, the Royal Guard Head
is the general of Arthdal.

451
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,058
Tell him to come out.

452
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,309
Come out.

453
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,686
Come out!

454
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,068
What are you doing?

455
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,195
Tell him to come out.

456
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,407
Everyone, go back to your posts.

457
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,034
Guards.

458
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,160
Put up your spears.

459
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,750
The king is dead, right?

460
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,877
Answer me.

461
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,003
What happened to the king?

462
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,880
Is he really dead?

463
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,506
Why can't you answer us?

464
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,300
If the king is really dead,

465
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,010
isn't everything over?

466
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,429
Answer us.
Answer us.

467
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,357
The Ago Tribe is coming here?

468
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,070
- Should we run away?
- Where to?

469
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,364
Let's run away.
Hey.

470
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,699
Hey.

471
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,368
Hey. Hey!

472
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,413
What's going on outside?
- General, this is bad.

473
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,290
Arthdal's troops lost to the Ago Tribe.

474
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,374
What?

475
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,794
What about the king?

476
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,420
What about King Tagon?

477
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,297
The rumors say he is dead

478
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,549
since the Arth Forest
was reduced to ashes.

479
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,176
Everything's over.

480
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,178
Now, the Ago Tribe will rush over here.

481
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,263
- Open this.
- Pardon?

482
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,473
There's still a chance.

483
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,600
- We can protect Arthdal.
- But...

484
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,477
You need someone to lead the army.

485
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,437
- Open it now!
- Yes, sir.

486
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,822
General.

487
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,326
Shouldn't we take refuge
before it's too late?

488
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,579
You should tell us so we can decide
whether or not to take refuge.

489
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,997
If the Third Corps was annihilated,

490
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,750
Arthdal is done for!

491
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,473
You should say something
as Royal Guard Head.

492
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,767
Over there.

493
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,727
It's the queen.

494
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,689
It's the queen.

495
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,482
It's the queen.

496
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,900
It's the queen!

497
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,194
How?

498
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,758
Nobody knows
whether the king is alive or not.

499
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,220
What are you guys doing?

500
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,805
Apprehend the queen right now--

501
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,102
Your Highness, aren't you a traitor
who started a rebellion?

502
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,989
Stop.

503
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,366
Those who are armed cannot enter.

504
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,204
If you come any closer,
you'll be considered rebels.

505
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,582
Archers!

506
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,837
Step back.

507
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,800
If you disband,
you will not be charged for your crime.

508
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,788
Yes, that is right.

509
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,374
I, Taealha, was a traitor
who tried to save Arthdal

510
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,584
from the crazy king.

511
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,171
Now, I'm the wife of a husband
whose life or death is unknown,

512
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,799
the mother of Arok
who will continue Arthdal,

513
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,468
and a proud Arthdal

514
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,138
who is trying to protect Arthdal
from the beasts of the Ago!

515
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,307
I, Asa Tanya,

516
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,518
am the reincarnation
of the Great Mother, Asa Sin,

517
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,478
High Priest of Arthdal,

518
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,273
and your sister who is trying
to protect your lives and future.

519
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:57,942
Soldiers.

520
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,902
Will you live with me

521
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,321
or die in vain?

522
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,659
Death is before us.

523
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,120
Inaishingi

524
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,957
is the benetbeot of General Saya,
and they have the same face.

525
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,544
High Priest Tanya

526
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,838
joined forces with the benetbeot brothers

527
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,717
and tried to hand us over
to the Ago beasts,

528
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,343
and she still plans to do so.

529
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,138
That's blasphemy!

530
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,141
The High Priest would never do
something like that!

531
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,475
That's right!

532
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,394
She's not that kind of person.

533
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,770
Don't say that.

534
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,898
Earlier,

535
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,693
the assassin sent by the High Priest
killed Jeungsugae,

536
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,988
the head of the Gadeul Tribe
and the minister of the bang of Trade.

537
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,781
MINISTER IN CHARGE OF TRADE

538
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,866
It is true!

539
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,536
I, Minster of the bang of Jichuk, Chojaha.

540
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:55,207
Had the queen not saved me,

541
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:02,298
I would've lost my life
to the High Priest!

542
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,428
We do not know
whether the king is alive or dead,

543
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,513
a minister lost his life,

544
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,599
and young warriors of Arthdal

545
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,810
lost their future
in the ashes of the Arth Forest.

546
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,687
After this,

547
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,148
what will we lose?

548
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,233
What do you wish to protect?

549
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,152
What we must not lose...

550
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,196
What you must protect...

551
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,573
...is the future in the great name

552
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,325
of Arthdal that we will continue...

553
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,161
...is the future of our siblings, friends,

554
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,496
and children.

555
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,626
We have warriors from
the White Mountain Tribe and Byeokjido

556
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,795
rushing to Arthdal.

557
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,964
We have siblings who know what's right

558
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,633
and in courage, we have each other.

559
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,512
We must drag down Asa Tanya,
the wicked fake Asa Sin,

560
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,848
We must dethrone King Tagon,
the fake Aramun who has lost,

561
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:56,602
...and protect Arthdal ourselves.

562
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,066
...and save each other!

563
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,653
Will you follow me, Taealha?

564
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,571
Will you join me, Asa Tanya?

565
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,370
I will join you,
the reincarnation of Asa Sin!

566
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,707
I will follow the queen and fight!

567
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:21,377
I will follow the will
of the reincarnation of Asa Sin!

568
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:29,009
Let's fight with the queen.
Let's kill the Ago Tribe!

569
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,761
Let's kill the Ago Tribe!

570
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,889
Let's kill them!

571
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,443
I'll tell them to start the smoke.

572
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,320
Let's kill them!

573
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,287
Let's fight with the queen!

574
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,584
WHITE FORD FOREST

575
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,794
EKNAD

576
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,801
I remember my brothers.

577
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,609
I remember my brothers.

578
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,697
Where are you from, my separated brother?

579
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:17,034
The end of the west, far, far away.

580
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:21,997
I come from my country, Irkebaek.

581
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:23,791
Irkebaek.

582
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:29,713
Is that the civilization founded
by the brothers who left?

583
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,798
That is right.

584
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,092
Will you go back to your hometown

585
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,844
and tell them about this land?

586
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:45,312
I must keep the old promise.

587
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:49,692
I will come back with tons of warriors.

588
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:55,155
This land has lives
of purple blood and red blood.

589
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,533
What will you do?

590
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,786
All red-bloods are lowly and deceitful.

591
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:04,498
We'll reign over them.

592
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,628
Brother, come with us.

593
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:14,049
Your blue blood will have divine powers

594
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,843
in Irkebaek.

595
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:16,927
You want me to live

596
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,890
trapped in a jail called civilization?

597
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:29,023
Only in the wide and huge embrace
of Mother Nature

598
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,816
are we free.

599
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:37,031
Can eagles walk on the sea
or can bears leave the forest?

600
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,659
Can sunflowers raise their heads
towards the moon?

601
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:45,914
Nature traps everyone

602
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,917
in millions of invisible walls.

603
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,213
Civilization breaks down
those countless walls

604
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:57,509
and gives us true freedom.

605
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:02,056
The freedom that divides high and low

606
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,768
and can only be enjoyed by those in front

607
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,480
while crushing the lives in the back?

608
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:15,653
As I expected,
the brothers who have left are dangerous.

609
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,946
What's more dangerous

610
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:22,076
is letting you return to your hometown.

611
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,925
Brother.

612
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:43,972
You're a disaster
to all creatures on this land.

613
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,545
Who are you?

614
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,215
"Ikomahis."

615
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,304
We finally meet.

616
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,223
Brother of promise.

617
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,152
Why isn't Moa coming?

618
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,820
We need to start the smoke.

619
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,240
You're making me nervous.

620
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,659
She'll come soon.

621
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:55,878
The smoke.

622
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,136
Gosh.

623
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,351
Why are you trying to start a smoke?

624
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,936
What does it mean?

625
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,897
You guys cannot win.

626
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,065
Airuju...

627
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,164
The one who continues

628
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,333
the will of Asa Sin shall become
Asa Sin themselves!

629
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,043
Let her will be done.

630
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,253
Let her will be done.

631
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,922
Embrace the one you rejected.

632
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,757
Embrace the one you rejected!

633
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,551
Follow the reincarnation of Asa Sin.

634
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,095
Follow the reincarnation of Asa Sin!

635
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,889
Come out onto the street.

636
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,183
Come out onto the street!

637
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,393
Embrace the unfamiliar.

638
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,728
Embrace the unfamiliar!

639
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,772
Embrace the one you rejected.

640
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,274
Embrace the one you rejected!

641
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,610
Follow the reincarnation
of Asa Sin.

642
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,654
Follow the reincarnation of Asa Sin!

643
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,781
Come out onto the street.

644
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,783
Come out onto the street!

645
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,618
Embrace the unfamiliar.

646
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,994
Embrace the unfamiliar!

647
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,621
The smoke should be rising now.

648
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,122
Embrace the one you rejected.

649
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:17,209
- Why...
Embrace the one you rejected!

650
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,503
Follow the reincarnation
of Asa Sin.

651
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,150
SEUCHEON

652
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,282
- What happened? Was there smoke?
- Was there?

653
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,784
There wasn't?

654
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,162
Why isn't there smoke?

655
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,416
That's strange.
Why isn't the smoke rising?

656
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,882
Why isn't there smoke?

657
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,598
Why? Why are you crying?

658
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,850
What happened? What about the smoke?

659
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,602
There won't be smoke.

660
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,438
Hae Yeobi killed the priests.

661
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,315
The queen must have returned.

662
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,942
I must let Niruha know quickly.

663
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,819
Embrace the one you rejected.

664
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,697
Embrace the one you rejected!

665
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,574
Follow the reincarnation
of Asa Sin.

666
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,576
Follow the reincarnation of Asa Sin!

667
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,817
The High Priest is on Inaishingi's side.

668
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,404
She is trying to hand Arthdal over
to the Ago Tribe.

669
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,407
Following the High Priest is treason!

670
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:16,119
Drop your weapons and go back immediately.

671
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,288
Then you will not be punished separately.

672
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,668
High Priest, stop the rebellion.

673
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,252
Rebellion?

674
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,967
The king lost the war, and we do not know
whether he is alive or dead.

675
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:34,304
And Queen Taealha abandoned Arthdal
and ran away to the White Peak Mountain.

676
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,597
Only I,

677
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,850
High Priest Asa Tanya, is left in Arthdal.

678
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,186
I am going to protect this land
and my people.

679
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,938
Everyone, step back.

680
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,945
Who ran away?

681
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,959
You look surprised.

682
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,587
You thought I would be
at the White Peak Mountain.

683
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:12,509
Are you waiting for the smoke?

684
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,638
Whatever you were trying to do,

685
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,473
it will not happen.

686
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,309
There's no one to start the smoke.

687
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,615
No!

688
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,467
What are you doing?

689
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,802
We'll get in trouble.
The queen came back to Arthdal.

690
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,722
That's why all of the Whisper Organization
must come out.

691
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,223
Who are you to decide?

692
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,100
You didn't get Niruha's permission.

693
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,477
Who are you to do this?

694
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,896
One who will

695
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,190
continue the will of Asa Sin.

696
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,819
- What?
- She said the one who continues the will

697
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,321
of Asa Sin was Asa Sin themselves.

698
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,657
I am

699
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,242
Asa Sin.

700
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,379
Niruha, what should we do?

701
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,590
The soldiers blocked the path
behind us too.

702
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,842
We're surrounded.

703
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,552
I order you once again!

704
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,181
Drop your weapons immediately.

705
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,390
Archers!

706
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,567
Remember the final moment of those

707
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,654
who were disrespectful
to the reincarnation

708
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,406
of Asa Sin.

709
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,119
Remember the person who died

710
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:07,082
by getting his heart ripped out
on the night of the new moon.

711
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,711
Your hands that are holding up
weapons against me

712
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,713
will strangle your own necks,

713
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,258
and kill your siblings and families.

714
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,551
Therefore,

715
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,888
your souls will not even be able
to become gosals,

716
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,891
and will fall
into the deepest abyss of darkness.

717
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,019
Your children

718
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:31,481
and their children will crawl
on all fours, unable to live or die.

719
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,442
What will you do?

720
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,205
I'll receive it.

721
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,170
I, Taealha, will receive
all of Asa Tanya's curse.

722
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:57,382
My hands that point weapons at
the High Priest will strangle my own neck.

723
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,135
My soul will fall into darkness

724
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,429
and my child will crawl on all fours.

725
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,598
I will receive all of the curse.

726
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,808
The rest of you will not receive any!

727
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,688
Even if my limbs get torn apart

728
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,690
and my soul gets scattered in the air,

729
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,859
I will kill the traitor, Tanya, myself

730
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,570
and receive every single bit of the curse.

731
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:22,824
Do not be afraid
and kill all of those traitors.

732
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,284
Archers!

733
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,995
Draw your bows!

734
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,792
Here.

735
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,052
Niruha.

736
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,805
They must be the Whisper Organization.

737
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,391
The seeds that you sowed

738
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,311
bloomed flowers.

739
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,079
Niruha.

740
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,957
It's smoke!

741
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,751
Smoke!

742
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,086
It's smoke!
- It's smoke!

743
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,381
Let's go, descendants of Asa Sin!

744
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,552
What are you doing? Let's go quickly!

745
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,596
Follow the one
who was despised the most

746
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,681
and embrace the one you rejected!

747
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:56,561
Follow the one who was despised the most
and embrace the one you rejected!

748
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:03,943
Follow the one who was despised the most
and embrace the one you rejected!

749
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:09,282
Were there really
so many of your people, Niruha?

750
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,660
Follow the one
who was despised the most

751
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,330
and embrace the one you rejected!

752
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:19,125
Let the will of Asa Sin flow in Arthdal.

753
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,296
Let the will of Asa Sin flow in Arthdal.

754
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,882
Follow the one
who was despised the most...

755
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,218
Your Highness,
all the people are pouring out.

756
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,804
What should we do?

757
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,138
The palace will be sieged.

758
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,973
There aren't enough of us.

759
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,601
What are they saying?

760
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:40,146
The one who continues the will of Asa Sin
shall become Asa Sin themselves.

761
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,607
They are thousands of Asa Sins.

762
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,943
Shall become Asa Sin themselves.

763
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:48,988
The one who continues the will of Asa Sin
shall become Asa Sin themselves.

764
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,116
Your Highness.

765
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,410
What will you do?

766
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,124
Tanya isn't
the High Priest anymore.

767
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,167
She's just a traitor of Arthdal!

768
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,464
Aramun Haesulla established the Union

769
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:09,926
and returned as King Tagon
to protect Arthdal.

770
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:13,430
Do you want this land to be taken away
by them now?

771
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,306
Kill them immediately!

772
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,475
No.

773
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,269
King Tagon is not Aramun Haesulla.

774
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,353
He's a fake!

775
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:25,358
If he was, he wouldn't have lost.
Aramun is the god of victory and unity.

776
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,112
Yes. King Tagon's Arthdal is gone now!

777
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,948
Yes! King Tagon is probably dead already!

778
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,868
Arthdal is doomed anyway!

779
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,244
That is right.

780
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,705
Tagon is neither Aramun nor the king!

781
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,165
He was a fake!

782
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,625
Yes.
He was a fake.

783
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,562
I will behead whoever steps back!

784
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,107
Behead the person next to you
if they drop their weapons!

785
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,067
I've already said that

786
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,819
I'll kill Tanya

787
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,446
and I will receive her curse.

788
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,575
You lot, kill all the traitors in front!

789
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:30,465
What are you doing?
Lift your spear up now!

790
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,142
One with the spear.

791
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,521
One with the spear.

792
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:47,982
Look at me.

793
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,955
Do you truly wish to receive
the curse of Asa Sin?

794
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,461
Niruha, forgive me.

795
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,380
I do not want to die. Please stop.

796
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,966
Niruha, please lift the curse.

797
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,468
I do not want to die. Please stop.

798
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:18,221
Niruha, forgive us.

799
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,556
Please save me.

800
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,183
Please lift the curse.

801
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,727
Niruha.
Please spare me.

802
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,854
Please lift the curse.
Niruha.

803
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,733
Please lift the curse.

804
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,236
Niruha.

805
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,823
Get me out of here.

806
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,001
If you do so, you will hear
Asa Sin's voice in your mind

807
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:51,462
when you least expect it.

808
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,717
This is God's voice.

809
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,345
Niruha spoke in our minds
using God's voice.

810
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,807
Niruha performed a miracle!

811
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,155
It was not I
who performed a miracle.

812
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,574
It was you.

813
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,326
Also, it is not my voice
that is God's voice.

814
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,536
Your voices are God's voice.

815
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:29,959
How can you say someone like us are gods?

816
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:31,711
Look.

817
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,463
God is not benevolent.

818
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,924
The benevolent ones are you Sarams.

819
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,885
God does not help.

820
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,928
The ones that help each other are you,

821
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,973
- Sarams.
- Is that so?

822
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,851
From being born, to growing up and living,

823
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,604
is there anything that you can do
without relying on Sarams?

824
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:54,859
So help each other and be benevolent.

825
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,986
That is the way to help yourselves.

826
01:00:56,986 --> 01:01:00,114
Also, from eating, to sleeping
and wearing clothes,

827
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,159
is there anything
in which you don't rely on the world?

828
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:06,371
So make the world...

829
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,501
Father. What we learned
in Iark is for the world...

830
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,795
The world? What about the world?

831
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,088
What we learned?

832
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,589
If they don't help each other,

833
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,341
they'll all be done for.

834
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,093
I'll threaten them in God's name.

835
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,845
So, as we learned, the world...

836
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,684
Make the world

837
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,478
a good place...

838
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,232
to live.

839
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,403
- Niruha.
High Priest Niruha.

840
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,574
Niruha.

841
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:46,411
High Priest Niruha.
Niruha.

842
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,954
Niruha.

843
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:58,089
Niruha.

844
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:01,551
Until the day I die
and become a handful of soil,

845
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:05,513
I will make the world a good place...

846
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:13,790
Gosh.

847
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,921
I didn't make that sound because
the castle was bigger than I thought.

848
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,088
MIRUSOL

849
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,215
What are you saying?

850
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,435
IPSAENG - DALSAE

851
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:36,979
BADORU

852
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:39,440
What's that?

853
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,677
This is the message
from the queen of Arthdal.

854
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,928
Speak.

855
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:12,807
Ago Tribe, retreat 600 steps back
and wait for a message.

856
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,900
Retreat? You're telling us to retreat?

857
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,193
Why should we retreat?

858
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,529
Are you insane? Have you lost your mind?

859
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:53,014
Was his name Geombul?
I heard he's from the Wahan Tribe.

860
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:56,809
Next is

861
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,895
Dunji of the Wahan Tribe.

862
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,391
You bastards!

863
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,143
Inaishingi.

864
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:42,021
Allow me to tear him into nine pieces.

865
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,193
Let's behead him and send his head back.
I'll do it!

866
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,028
Let's attack now and kill them...

867
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,321
Next!

868
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,577
Who do you think will be next?

869
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,401
I'll say this again.

870
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,653
Retreat 600 steps back
and wait for a message.

871
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,414
Eunseom.

872
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,666
From here,

873
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,127
you look amazing.

874
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,131
That's what you're saying right now?

875
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,091
Of course.

876
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,261
I'm the great reincarnation of Asa Sin,

877
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:58,055
the god of Arthdal.

878
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,643
Tanya.

879
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,104
Eunseom.

880
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:06,814
God

881
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:08,899
has God's own path.

882
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,528
Inaishingi

883
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,490
should follow Inaishingi's path.

884
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:18,951
Do you understand?

885
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,062
The Ago Tribe retreated
and went into the forest.

886
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,065
We bought some time.

887
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,734
Thanks to your timely return,

888
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,903
the High Priest's rebellion
was suppressed.

889
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:55,946
Since the queen sent them a message,

890
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:58,532
the White Mountain Tribe's warriors
will arrive soon.

891
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:02,328
Also, the Second Corps of Byeokjido
will arrive soon too.

892
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,705
That's great.

893
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,165
I'm relieved.

894
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,045
We haven't lost yet.

895
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:14,465
The sky never rained for me

896
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,675
and the earth never bloomed
a flower for me,

897
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,511
but I did it in the end.

898
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:23,974
Rain will pour when I climb mountains and
storms will come when I'm out at sea,

899
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:25,726
but in the end, I, Tagon,

900
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:29,355
will climb the mountains
and cross the oceans.

901
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,398
For the glory of King Tagon.

902
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:34,235
For the glory of King Tagon.

903
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,195
For the glory of King Tagon.

904
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,448
For the glory of King Tagon.

905
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:43,160
For the glory of King Tagon.

906
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:46,372
For the glory of King Tagon.

907
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:52,753
The meeting with Inaishingi...

908
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:54,255
You should take charge.

909
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,344
You know why the people who were confident

910
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:02,972
and the soldiers who were agitated
suddenly became quiet.

911
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,723
It's because the king's alive.

912
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:07,935
Because Aramun returned alive.

913
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,061
Aramun, Aramun!

914
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,231
Don't talk about that.

915
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,570
I cannot attend the meeting
with the Ago Tribe.

916
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,613
It's different from the night battle.

917
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:21,615
I cannot leave the castle myself.

918
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,452
Go and subdue them as you like.

919
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:26,662
Fine.

920
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,455
I will.

921
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,131
Tagon.

922
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,883
Did I tell you this?

923
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,012
I'm glad that you're alive,

924
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,390
and I'm happy that you're back.

925
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,311
I mean it.

926
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:00,571
Do you think I would abandon Arthdal
and run away?

927
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:03,949
Don't worry.

928
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:06,285
I'll never leave

929
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,204
Arthdal behind.

930
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,056
I decided to retreat because...

931
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,265
It's actually for the better.

932
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,601
According to our plan, we bought time.

933
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,103
The warriors' morale is another matter.

934
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,231
Take care of them well.

935
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:37,483
Ipsaeng.

936
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:39,485
Yes.

937
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:40,903
I know how worried you are

938
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:43,864
about me getting shaken

939
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:46,617
because of Tanya.

940
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:51,622
But it's okay.

941
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:53,874
I will not be shaken at all.

942
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,713
I am Inaishingi.

943
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:15,145
Eunseom. Whether or not you're Inaishingi,
it's the same if you have a heart.

944
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,856
It's all right to be shaken

945
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:19,316
because you'll overcome it.

946
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:20,609
I believe in you.

947
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:44,258
Hey, don't you believe in Inaishingi?

948
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,218
It's not about believing him or not.

949
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:50,097
To Eunseom,
Tanya is the beginning of everything.

950
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:53,017
With Tanya tied up on the castle wall...

951
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:56,687
Can he even stand it?

952
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,028
Where are you going?

953
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:08,824
He must be upset too.
He's also friends with the High Priest.

954
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:11,577
How is Inaishingi?

955
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,579
He was reading the map upside down.

956
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:14,955
Ah!

957
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:19,543
Hey. What should we do now?

958
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,628
We can't tell him to attack

959
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,464
nor can we just stay here like this.

960
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:01,001
You must've had a dream.

961
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,757
A few days later, a boat will come,

962
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:11,637
and you will leave with us.

963
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,121
Your Majesty.

964
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:40,457
Baekha.

965
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:43,710
Your son is so cute.

966
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:46,547
He looks like Arok.

967
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,676
I heard your family made bichwisan.

968
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,595
A TYPE OF POISON THAT IS
COLORLESS, ODORLESS, AND TASTELESS

969
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:57,266
Are the ingredients of bichwisan
hard to find?

970
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:02,271
Don't worry. I'm not trying
to reveal the secret of the Hae Tribe.

971
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,065
The ingredients are not precious.

972
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,569
How much can kill a person?

973
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:11,864
Three drops are enough.

974
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,324
Make me bichwisan.

975
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:17,870
But...

976
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,664
I need the permission from the queen.

977
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:22,541
If you refuse, I have no choice.

978
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:41,518
Yes, I will.

979
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:42,728
I will make it for you.

980
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:45,606
I will make it.

981
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:48,817
Thank you.

982
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:54,448
Shall we look around the palace?

983
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,472
How does it feel
to have lost everything?

984
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,936
Lost everything?

985
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,021
That day, you saw

986
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:10,899
that the seeds I sowed bloomed flowers.

987
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:12,943
You lost.

988
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:14,987
And you will lose,

989
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,531
both to Eunseom and me.

990
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:18,615
Yes, I saw it.

991
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:20,742
I lost.

992
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:22,869
I admit it.

993
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,416
In the end, Inaishingi will come,

994
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,626
and Arthdal will fall.

995
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:31,503
But...

996
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:33,714
it doesn't matter now.

997
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:37,175
I cut off everything.

998
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:40,971
Arthdal and Aramun Haesulla.

999
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:46,268
Why are you still crying then?

1000
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:51,773
Your heart is still crying sadly.

1001
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:57,195
A child who is anxious
about being abandoned by the world.

1002
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:00,866
Am I wrong?

1003
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:07,164
You really do have
the psychic ability of the gods.

1004
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:08,373
Read it again.

1005
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,960
Can you hear my thoughts now?

1006
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:27,643
Do you now understand
what I'm trying to do?

1007
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:42,324
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

1008
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:01,510
The price of Tanya's life
is your death.

1009
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,429
If you wish to save the High Priest,

1010
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:06,515
Inaishingi must go to
the Great Shrine alone.

1011
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:07,974
Eunseom will be here soon.

1012
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:10,769
Also, tell him
that I went to save her first.

1013
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:12,646
No negotiations.

1014
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:14,815
-Release Tanya.
You...

1015
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,152
Inaishingi, you lost.

1016
01:18:19,152 --> 01:18:23,365
The Ago Union will now be torn
into 30 pieces.

1017
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:25,992
I might become
a failed Asa Sin too.

1018
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:28,537
This isn't the end.

1019
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,122
Promise me now.
