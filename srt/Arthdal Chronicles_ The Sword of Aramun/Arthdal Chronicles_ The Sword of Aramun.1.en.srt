1
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:49,966
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

2
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,427
HALF BLOODS BORN BETWEEN
A SARAM AND A NEANTHAL

3
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,012
THEIR BLOOD IS PURPLE

4
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,930
AND ARE CONSIDERED CURSED BEINGS
IN ARTHDAL

5
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,352
In Arthdal,
there was a hidden prophecy from long ago.

6
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:05,732
The prophecy said three children
who each symbolize sword, bell, and mirror

7
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,695
will be born at the same time
and bring this world to an end.

8
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:16,451
The children of the prophecy were
Eunseom, Tanya, and Saya.

9
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,414
Eunseom and Saya were twins
and they were Igutus.

10
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,334
Their mother, Asa Hon,

11
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:28,838
fought against Tagon who tried to
annihilate Neanthals and protected them.

12
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:32,675
She fell in love with one of them
and gave birth to twin Igutus.

13
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:38,098
But in the end,
she lost her husband, Ragaz, to Tagon.

14
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,810
Even Saya, one of the twins,
was taken away by Tagon.

15
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,564
Asa Hon ran away with Eunseom

16
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,317
and Eunseom met
another child of the prophecy,

17
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,195
Tanya, a girl from the Wahan Tribe.

18
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,368
Saya, who was taken away by Tagon,
grew up in a civilization called Arthdal.

19
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,620
Eunseom and Tanya,

20
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,582
unaware of what the prophecy
about them even means,

21
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:08,545
grew up as members
of the Wahan Tribe in nature.

22
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,965
Then one day,

23
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,176
Arthdal invaded the Wahan Tribe.

24
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,638
A lot of people
of the Wahan Tribe were massacred.

25
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,725
But even more people
were taken to Arthdal as slaves.

26
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,895
Tanya became Arthdal's slave

27
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,148
and Eunseom barely managed to escape.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,947
He promised to come back
to save Tanya and the Wahan Tribe.

29
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,826
Time passed by,

30
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,329
and Tagon's tyranny in Arthdal got worse.

31
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,709
To hide that he was an Igutu himself,

32
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,878
Tagon killed a lot of people.

33
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,922
And now,

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,342
every child of the prophecy
had become a hero.

35
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,596
Tanya was no longer a slave.

36
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,639
She became the high priest of Arthdal.

37
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:06,477
Eunseom became Inaishingi,
the leader of the Ago Tribe.

38
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,024
Saya became the commander of Arthdal.

39
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,817
However...

40
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,488
Tanya still didn't know
whether Eunseom was alive or dead

41
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,952
and Saya didn't know that his lost brother
was the head of the enemy army.

42
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:29,125
Eunseom didn't even know
that he had a long lost twin brother.

43
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,546
Also, they still didn't know

44
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:38,218
what the prophecy that said
they would end this world truly meant.

45
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:45,266
But they will meet the fate
that the prophecy is pointing toward.

46
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:51,397
WEAK ONES

47
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,656
The history of wind, stars, and blood.

48
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,202
I record the chronicle of Arthdal Kingdom.

49
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,955
Arthdal's calendar.

50
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,289
Year of the lazy bear.

51
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,710
The union ended
and Tagon became the king.

52
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,922
I will conquer the east!

53
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,884
Let us conquer the Ago Tribe!

54
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,719
Conquer the Ago Tribe!

55
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,305
Let's conquer!

56
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,642
Let's conquer!

57
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,436
However,
the conquest of the Ago Tribe

58
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,272
was stopped by an unexpected enemy.

59
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,315
Year of the crouching chicken.

60
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,276
The Ggachinol and the Bato Tribes

61
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,029
plotted revenge against Tagon
and rebelled.

62
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,590
The fierce battle continued
for several years.

63
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,219
Year of the wise rat, month of the tiger.

64
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:07,098
In the end, King Tagon
went to fight in the battle himself.

65
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,004
KING OF ARTHDAL

66
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,756
We got him.

67
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,683
Your long-lasting rebellion
has finally come to an end.

68
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,809
Oraha of Ggachinol.

69
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,269
ORAHA: HEAD OF A TRIBE

70
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,814
My King,
you ended the Ggachinol Tribe's rebellion.

71
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,150
Congratulations.

72
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,361
Congratulations.

73
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,280
What's left now
was the Bato Tribe by the Notsan River

74
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,950
and the reincarnation of Inaishingi

75
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,413
who unified 30 clans of the Ago Tribe
and took over the Agoha Forest.

76
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,999
He was Eunseom.

77
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:28,513
Inaishingi is here

78
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:34,227
Inaishingi is here

79
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:40,983
Stone walls will collapse

80
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:48,074
Homes will be ruined

81
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:53,871
The blue flame rages like a storm

82
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:59,710
They grew up in war and rebellion,
so these kids don't know fear.

83
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,755
Still, they must be afraid of Inaishingi
judging from the lyrics.

84
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,382
AGO TRIBE'S HERO
WHO DEFEATED ARAMUN HAESULLA 200 YEARS AGO

85
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,468
Right across the Notsan River over there
is the land of the Ago Tribe.

86
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:13,057
It stands to reason that the notoriety
of Inaishingi reached this land.

87
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,102
That notoriety will end now,
thanks to you.

88
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,271
Thanks for your hard work.

89
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,607
I do this for my business,

90
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,402
but Oraha of the Bato Tribe
made a big decision.

91
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,946
Probably because he's tired
of the long rebellion.

92
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,365
The amazing one is Lord Saya.

93
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,576
He came up with a plan

94
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,412
to get rid of Inaishingi
and the Bato Tribe at once.

95
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,498
Do you really think
Inaishingi will fall for it?

96
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,048
The Ago Tribe
desperately needs the Bato Tribe's help.

97
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,509
He'll definitely come.

98
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,180
I heard nobody knows
Inaishingi's face except the Ago Tribe.

99
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,098
It's not just his face.

100
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,934
What his actual name is, where he's from.

101
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,353
Everything is unknown.

102
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,523
We just know that he is the reincarnation
of Inaishingi.

103
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,278
Have you really seen Inaishingi's face?

104
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,660
Yes, it's a face I'll never forget.

105
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,455
We need to make him
take off that ugly visor

106
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,415
and show his face today.

107
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,921
If Lord Saya sees his face...

108
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,049
he'll be...

109
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,427
very surprised.

110
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,307
NOTSAN RIVER

111
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,950
BATO TRIBE'S BASE

112
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,535
Inaishingi is coming.

113
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,857
In the name of Mihaje,

114
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,944
I welcome Inaishingi of the Ago Tribe.

115
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,863
Garutum Oraha,
the father of the Bato Tribe.

116
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,492
Inaishingi expresses
his deep gratitude at your invitation.

117
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,370
Please.

118
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,463
HEAD OF
THE SECRET INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION

119
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,548
Get ready.

120
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,272
Inaishingi.

121
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,900
Congratulations on uniting Ago
for the first time in 200 years.

122
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:14,155
Are you going to cross
the Notsan River and fight Arthdal?

123
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,115
Of course.

124
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,701
Inaishingi here
will get back the old land of Ago...

125
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,785
FOUNDER OF ARTHDAL UNION,
LEGENDARY HERO OF ARTHDAL

126
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,245
...that Aramun Haesulla took away.

127
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,540
Yes. Since we, the Bato Tribe,
joined the Ago Union,

128
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,083
it will definitely happen.

129
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,963
I heard your fathers and elders
were brutally murdered by Tagon.

130
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,049
Once we enter Arthdal,

131
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,468
I'll cut off Tagon's head
and give it to you, Oraha.

132
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,763
I appreciate it.

133
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,516
The Bato Tribe and the Ago Tribe
have become brothers now.

134
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,352
Let's have a drink of alliance.

135
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,520
- Bring it here.
- Yes, Oraha.

136
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,312
I can't believe
you're giving me such a precious thing.

137
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,239
Here.

138
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,411
Now.

139
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,287
We Bato and Ago

140
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,624
haven't interacted for a long time
with the Notsan River between us.

141
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,919
But in the year of the hungry snake,
we have become brothers.

142
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,297
The arrow of Mihaje
and the waterfall of Ago

143
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,258
will bless us today.

144
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,311
You said you'd cut off...

145
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,566
Tagon's neck.

146
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,403
Isn't the Ago Tribe's goal
getting back their old land?

147
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,238
Are you aiming for Arthdal too?

148
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,199
Are you capable of that?

149
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,076
What are you doing?

150
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,203
You're being disrespectful.

151
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,038
Since you're from Arthdal,

152
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,124
you must know
the power of the civilization.

153
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,752
Since you came from Gitbadak,
you must know how scary the world is.

154
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,836
DEEPEST PART OF THE JEWEL MINE

155
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,463
How can you have...

156
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,716
such an absurd idea, Inaishingi?

157
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,823
LEADER OF THE AGO UNION,
THE REINCARNATION OF INAISHINGI

158
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,908
It really was you.

159
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,577
I heard the mediator was a merchant.

160
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,122
I spared your life

161
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,334
and with the jewels
you stole from Ipsaeng,

162
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,420
you became a successful merchant

163
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,881
for this?

164
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,510
Syoreujagin.

165
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,305
How are those jewels Ipsaeng's? It's mine.

166
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,683
You must've been scared,
seeing how you changed clothes.

167
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,812
But you can't leave here alive anyway.

168
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,438
I see.

169
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,691
There must be tons of soldiers outside.

170
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,527
Gosh.

171
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:44,156
I can't tell whether I would be alive
or dead by the end of the day.

172
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,636
Why just point it at me?

173
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,179
Just cut me.

174
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,393
Because you think you'll die too
if you kill me?

175
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,105
You're exchanging your life
with Inaishingi's.

176
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,189
Isn't that...

177
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,732
an honor?

178
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,944
In your insignificant life,

179
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,822
the chance to kill Inaishingi has come.

180
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,660
You will become

181
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,954
the man who killed Inaishingi.

182
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,999
Countless songs written after you
will be sung.

183
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,586
The song of a legendary warrior
will be sung

184
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,838
in Arthdal across the Notsan River,

185
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,673
from Arthdal to White Peak Mountain,

186
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,884
and Atturad beyond White Peak Mountain.

187
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,469
Why are you hesitating?

188
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,519
You can't do it?

189
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,815
Then there will be no song.

190
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,651
What about this?

191
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,322
Do you know the swallow tail spell?

192
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,659
I'm not a danggeuri...

193
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,994
DANGGEURI: A SHAMAN

194
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,329
...but I'll try.

195
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,080
Now.

196
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,916
Let's say this is you.

197
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,667
And this...

198
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,920
is your neck.

199
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,271
Now...

200
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,856
this time...

201
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,443
let's say this is you.

202
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,111
Kill Inaishingi.

203
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,571
Now!

204
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,972
Now, shall we go out?

205
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,526
Why isn't he giving us the signal?

206
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,101
Everyone, stop!

207
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,230
Don't mind him. Kill them.

208
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,440
Stop!

209
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,942
He's holding the Oraha
of the Bato Tribe hostage.

210
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,329
If he dies...

211
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,833
won't you become the next oraha?

212
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,137
That man is Inaishingi.

213
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,388
Get him.

214
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,015
Attack.

215
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,861
Milsol!

216
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,773
Inaishingi, hurry up.

217
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,151
You must hurry.

218
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,820
Now.

219
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,046
Lord Saya.

220
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:22,721
EUNSEOM'S TWIN, TAGON'S ADOPTED SON

221
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,640
You...

222
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,559
are Inaishingi?

223
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,634
Chase him.

224
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,762
Keep chasing.

225
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,264
There's a river up front.

226
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,844
They caught him.

227
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,804
This is the end of Inaishingi.

228
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,141
You...

229
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,269
are really Inaishingi?

230
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,148
Get off and drop your weapons.

231
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,401
God only punishes the weak.

232
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,987
Give up, Inaishingi.

233
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,947
That's right.

234
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,576
Whichever God it is,

235
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,578
they punish the weak.

236
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,627
It's a whistle arrow.

237
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,712
AN ARROW THAT MAKES A SOUND

238
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,965
As warriors yourselves,
you know what this means, right?

239
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,426
Good job coming this far.

240
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,595
Weak ones.

241
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,597
Now receive...

242
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,891
your punishment.

243
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,107
Retreat, retreat!

244
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,358
Retreat!

245
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,656
In the names

246
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,450
of the waterfall and the Agoha Forest!

247
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,036
Under the name of Inaishingi!

248
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,884
Hanchoa Castle.

249
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,835
The rebellion in the south is over.

250
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,295
That's a relief, Mother.

251
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,588
ARTHDAL'S QUEEN CONSORT

252
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,839
Yes, Arok.

253
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,133
Your father must've finished it well.

254
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,259
TAGON AND TAEALHA'S SON

255
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,387
Then the Bato Tribe
in the north is the only one left.

256
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,638
That's right.

257
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,017
But it has been two years
since Lord Saya went to subdue them.

258
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,101
ASA PIL

259
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,229
It seems like you need to grow up quickly

260
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,856
and head north yourself.

261
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,446
The king defeated
the Ggachinol Tribe!

262
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,115
He's here!

263
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,829
Hurrah!

264
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,207
Hurrah!

265
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,626
Hurrah!

266
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,216
Darn you.

267
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,391
Tagon.

268
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,561
We sincerely congratulate you
on your victory.

269
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,946
The Queen isn't here.

270
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,493
Please let us through.
I need to give this to the prince.

271
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,954
Please? It will only take a moment.

272
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,123
You guys don't understand.

273
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,000
What is this about?

274
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,462
I'm a bachi of Aram Village.
I have something to give to the prince.

275
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,218
They're from Aram Village.

276
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,302
HAE TUAK, HAE YEOBI

277
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,471
They have something they want
to give to Prince Arok.

278
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,891
- Should I send them away?
- Your Highness.

279
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,810
I'm a bachi of Aram Village.

280
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,894
BACHI: A CRAFTSMAN OR ENGINEER

281
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,564
I'm not good enough,
but I made something for the prince.

282
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,774
I want to give it to him.

283
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,118
Wait.

284
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,620
Let him open the box himself

285
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,706
and bring the box opened.

286
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,561
What is this?

287
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,438
How do you use it?

288
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,814
If you'll allow me,

289
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,858
I'll show you how to use it.

290
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,995
Wow.

291
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,173
I want this.

292
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,130
You don't need to commit suicide.

293
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,175
You don't even need to bite your tongue.

294
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:03,723
I know
you won't tell who was behind this.

295
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:07,727
But you can't die on your own.

296
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,729
Why?

297
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,481
Because your life isn't yours.

298
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,110
Arok.

299
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,194
Yes, Mother.

300
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,286
He tried to kill you.

301
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,165
The life of the person
who tried to kill you is yours.

302
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,668
End it.

303
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,681
Here, Arok.

304
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,601
Come on.

305
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,955
Good job.

306
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,416
Let's go.

307
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,096
Arok, you did something wrong. What is it?

308
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,683
I'm shaking too much.

309
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,394
Your father and I were like that
at first too.

310
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:32,979
Other than that.

311
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,733
I wasn't able to do it alone.

312
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,321
You can get help when it's difficult.

313
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,906
That's fine.

314
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,366
I don't know.

315
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,625
This.

316
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,794
You said you wanted this.

317
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,421
What you want, what you must have.

318
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,759
Don't forget that under any circumstances.

319
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,844
Yes, Mother.

320
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,391
Find out what poison was used
for the needle.

321
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,310
I will.

322
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,232
Someone tried
to assassinate them.

323
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,944
What? What do you mean? Assassination?

324
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,696
So is everyone safe?

325
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:27,200
Yes. Thankfully,
the Queen handled them all.

326
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,955
Grand Commander Mubaek.

327
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,334
Tomorrow, lead two corps
and leave for Pyeongmire Castle first.

328
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,418
Yes, Your Majesty.

329
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,503
GREAT COMMANDER MUBAEK

330
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,963
Are we finally going to war?

331
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,007
Not yet.
But we'll fight them soon.

332
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,092
WARRIOR YEONBAL, WARRIOR GITOHA

333
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,927
So train hard.

334
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,512
Yes, Your Majesty.

335
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,680
Your Majesty.

336
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,116
What are those things on their wrists?

337
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,201
They're bracelets made
in the Great Shrine.

338
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,828
I know where they're made.

339
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,872
Why are they wearing them?

340
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,626
Everyone is anxious before the war.

341
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,213
How foolish.

342
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,475
Ishillobu beresa.

343
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,852
ISHILLOBU BERESA: GOD'S GLORY

344
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,237
The water of this undrying spring

345
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,365
seeps out of the rocks itself.
It's sacred.

346
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:54,120
Before meeting Niruha,
wash your hands and cleanse yourself.

347
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,465
Hello.

348
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,549
WAHAN TRIBE, PRIEST

349
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,930
What?

350
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,724
All of the crops yield of the north

351
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,851
of White Ford Forest?

352
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,646
Yes. If the Great Shrine could use it
for something good,

353
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,648
it would be a great honor for me.

354
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,735
Oh. Okay.

355
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:33,785
Jenak of Ogam Guild.
I give you the blessings of Airuju.

356
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,869
WAHAN TRIBE, HIGH PRIEST
OF ARTHDAL, REINCARNATION OF ASA SIN

357
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:37,956
Come closer.

358
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,475
This is the mark that connects your heart
and the wishes of Airuju.

359
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,559
GREATEST OF THE EIGHT GODS OF ARTH

360
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,644
Cherish it.

361
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,941
Ishillobu beresa.

362
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,610
Niruha, live forever.

363
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,987
A TITLE OF HONOR

364
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,412
Jenak of Ogam Guild.

365
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,874
Jenak of Ogam Guild.

366
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,213
Jenak of Ogam Guild.

367
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,800
Yes, Niruha. Did you call?

368
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,554
It's nothing.

369
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,515
- You may leave.
- Okay.

370
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,781
Niruha.

371
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,162
Father.

372
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,998
It hurts.

373
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,461
No, no.
-

374
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,467
Niruha. I am the King's guard...

375
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,261
You lost your daughter.

376
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,680
Niruha.

377
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,931
And you...

378
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,894
killed a lot of children
of the Bato Tribe last time.

379
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,480
You are right.

380
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,858
My sin is bigger
than the Great Gochiju Rock.

381
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,944
Don't blame yourself.

382
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,738
Don't blame yourself.

383
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,990
Carry it out.

384
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:43,307
Pray for the children you killed.

385
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,394
I will pray for your child.

386
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,152
How can you do it
for someone as lowly as me?

387
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,029
Both a high priest and a mere guard

388
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,325
are just descendants of Asa Sin
if we think the same.

389
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,850
Mubaek.

390
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,897
WARRIOR BAKRYANGPUNG

391
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,857
Are you going to see Niruha
before you leave?

392
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,736
While I'm gone,
take good care of Niruha.

393
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,154
Don't worry, Mubaek.

394
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,449
My life is already dedicated
to Tanya Niruha.

395
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,410
That night when the new moon rose,

396
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,039
I saw the prophecy,
the curse that Niruha said,

397
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,541
coming true right in front of my eyes.

398
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,336
She killed everyone else and saved me.

399
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,631
It's the life that Niruha gave.

400
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,051
By the way,

401
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,055
did you tell Niruha about that place?

402
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,683
I'll tell her about it
and take her there when I come back.

403
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,685
How happy would she be to see it?

404
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,687
The correct history will be recorded now.

405
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,817
Actually, I know.

406
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,822
What you, Tanya Niruha,
and Saya are planning to do together.

407
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,367
Defeating King Tagon...

408
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,913
Who said that nonsense?

409
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,542
I'll join you, Mubaek.

410
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,597
Niruha.

411
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,682
MOA

412
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,142
As you said, I relayed everything to Doti.

413
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,943
Did you do it well?

414
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,904
What did you say?

415
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:05,408
There are people who take wealth,
and there are people who take hearts,

416
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,326
as for the guard who came today,

417
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:11,289
treat him with more care
than the others who take hearts.

418
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,582
That's what I told her.

419
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,877
How many people
do Doti treat with care now?

420
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,045
Sorry?

421
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,797
Well...

422
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,841
I don't know.

423
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,261
Of course you shouldn't know.

424
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,183
Why? Do you want to hear
Asa Sin's words?

425
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,562
Niruha, will you tell me
about her today too?

426
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,064
Yes. Sit down.

427
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,482
Okay, Niruha.

428
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,993
The first descendant of Asa Sin
to the second descendant of Asa Sin.

429
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,077
THE GREAT SPIRITUAL
MOTHER OF ARTHDAL

430
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:54,040
The second descendant of Asa Sin
hears God's voice.

431
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,905
I heard someone tried
to assassinate Prince Arok.

432
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,865
Who was it?

433
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,910
It might be the Bato Tribe
from Ttesarichon who holds grudges.

434
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,995
The queen might have staged it.

435
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,791
Or the king might've staged it.

436
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,921
You've changed a lot too, Mubaek.

437
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,799
They all have motivations.

438
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,761
If it's about motivations,
Saya would have the biggest one.

439
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,390
Who will become Arthdal's successor?

440
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,474
Lord Saya...

441
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:59,021
decided to follow the way
of the world you're going to make.

442
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,606
It probably isn't him.

443
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,776
You're probably right.
Looking at how Saya...

444
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,656
is searching for Eunseom desperately.

445
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,452
I'm sure Eunseom is definitely alive.

446
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,248
You... will meet him.

447
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,460
If you leave now,

448
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,879
when will you come back?

449
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,382
I'm not sure.

450
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,426
The order was given suddenly.

451
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,261
Maybe this time...

452
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,265
a war might really break out.

453
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:38,060
Take care of yourself on the long journey.

454
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,980
Don't get injured.
Make sure you come back.

455
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,033
Congratulations on your victory, my King.

456
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,536
I heard about what happened.

457
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,746
I'm glad you're both safe.

458
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,876
I'll change the guards
and the servants of Arok

459
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,043
and pick new ones.

460
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,630
I'll move his chamber
to somewhere deep in the palace

461
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,633
and make Gilseon manage everyone he meets.

462
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,053
The same goes for your people.

463
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,849
What about Saya?

464
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,726
Shouldn't you do something about Saya?

465
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,436
What do you mean?

466
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,897
Who do you think did it? It's Saya.

467
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,400
It's been two years
since Saya went to Hanchoa.

468
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,030
Saya is the head of the bangs,
and so are the assassins.

469
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,114
BANG OF ROYAL ADMINISTRATION MILSOL: HEAD
OF THE SECRET INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION

470
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,117
- It's obvious.
- You want to think it's obvious.

471
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,661
You must be worried about Saya.

472
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,707
This happened
because you didn't decide the successor.

473
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,542
You didn't perform
the sacred ritual for Arok,

474
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,045
let alone the ritual of wind and flower!

475
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,964
I'm not the one that performs it.
The high priest does it.

476
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:52,259
If you ask, Tanya will do it.
Is that even an excuse?

477
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,479
I subdued the rebellion
and came back today.

478
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,356
Niruha.

479
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,203
You must've had a dream.

480
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,663
But why...

481
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:04,790
Yes.

482
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,377
It was a scary dream.

483
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,006
YANGCHA

484
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,591
Niruha.

485
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,885
Your Highness.

486
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,431
We're having a conversation. Leave.

487
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,727
The Ago Tribe crossed the Notsan River.

488
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,107
And Hanchoa Castle...

489
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,192
What about it?

490
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,489
Who knew the Ago Tribe
would suddenly conquer Hanchoa Castle?

491
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,159
The King would've known.

492
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,036
He was waiting for it.

493
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,497
Pardon? What do you mean, Your Highness?

494
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,458
The rebellion of Ggachinol's over now,

495
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,586
and the Ago Tribe crossed
the Notsan River. It's perfect timing.

496
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,839
Isn't that right, my King?

497
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:56,925
It's as she said.

498
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,261
To the plains...

499
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,765
You wanted to drag them out to the plains.

500
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,141
That is right.

501
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,519
If we fight the Ago Tribe
in that gigantic Agoha Forest,

502
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,938
it would become an endless war.

503
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,232
Just like during the Neanthal Hunt.

504
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:15,527
Even Aramun lost to Inaishingi
in the Agoha Forest.

505
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,489
But they're in the plains now.

506
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,033
But isn't it too late?

507
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,827
Mobon Castle, Pyeongmire, and Molabeol.

508
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:28,082
If we lose any of the three,
our trade route will get cut off,

509
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,292
and they will form a supply route.

510
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,169
Even if we prepare the corps quickly...

511
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,337
They...

512
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,756
already left.

513
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:39,176
Yes. Your Majesty sent the corps
of Great Commander Mubaek

514
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,011
to Pyeongmirae.

515
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,099
Corps One, Five, and Nine.

516
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,518
Get ready to leave
for Hanchoa immediately.

517
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,480
Hanchoa Plains will be the place
for our final battle.

518
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,107
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

519
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,787
Milsol is back.

520
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,689
Did you know?

521
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,400
Eunseom isn't exactly a common name.

522
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,693
WAHAN TRIBE, ARTHDAL'S WARRIOR

523
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:41,029
When I heard that name from Red Claw,
at first, it was hard for me...

524
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,242
to believe either.

525
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,620
It's amazing that the person
we thought dead was alive.

526
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,830
But Inaishingi?

527
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,756
Have you ever seen the face...

528
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,550
of Eunseom?

529
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,053
Not clearly.

530
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,767
It was for an instant in the dark,
and he was dressed up as a warrior.

531
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,945
He's your first opponent
that you'll have to beat

532
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,113
purely with your strength.

533
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,909
You'll be the general of the conquest.

534
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,120
You know what this means, right?

535
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,540
Once you win this war,
you'll be qualified...

536
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,543
as my successor.

537
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,888
I found my benetbeot, Niruha.

538
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:48,972
BENETBEOT: TWIN BROTHER

539
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,517
You found Eunseom?

540
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,853
I wish I hadn't.

541
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,898
Then I could continue to miss him.

542
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,567
My brother.

543
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,487
What do you mean?

544
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:11,245
It means the beautiful plan made
by Niruha, Mubaek, and me...

545
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,372
is falling apart.

546
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,249
Explain so I can understand.

547
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:19,044
"Let's find the brothers of Bell,
Mirror, and Sword.

548
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,922
"Let those who think alike come together,
defeat Tagon...

549
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,844
"and make a new world.

550
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,221
"Mubaek will help too."

551
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,514
Yes, that's what I said.

552
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,560
You wanted to see the world
we were going to make together.

553
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,771
I did.

554
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,816
Brothers. Thinking alike.

555
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,401
Together.

556
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,611
The world.

557
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,196
I liked how they sounded.

558
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,408
So? Did something change?

559
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,244
What happened?
Why are you acting like this?

560
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,624
Eunseom is Inaishingi.

561
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,834
LEGENDARY HERO
OF AGO TRIBE THAT REINCARNATES

562
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,044
Inaishingi is Eunseom.

563
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,882
And I'll go to war
as the general of the troops.

564
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,133
What...

565
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,594
do you mean?

566
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,095
He's my enemy now.

567
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,765
He's someone
I need to beat with my strength alone.

568
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,310
I must kill him. And...

569
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,522
Eunseom will die of course.

570
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,486
We know every strategy of the Ago Tribe.

571
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,196
They don't know how strong we are.

572
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:31,074
Besides, they came out to the plains.

573
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,868
They are no match for us.

574
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,786
That fool.

575
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:41,376
So, you better make another plan.

576
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,387
How is that possible?

577
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,931
He's not even from the Ago Tribe.

578
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,391
How can he become Inaishingi
of the Ago Tribe?

579
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,852
It doesn't make sense.

580
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,562
They said Inaishingi was brutal.

581
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,731
Is it...

582
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,317
really Eunseom?

583
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,986
Tagon knew before me.

584
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,030
Then...

585
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,240
you and Eunseom...

586
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,868
He doesn't know that he's my benetbeot. So...

587
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,621
I must kill him fast

588
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,456
before he finds out.

589
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,336
What about Eunseom?

590
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,965
Did Eunseom see you?

591
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,011
If he did,

592
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,305
does that change anything?

593
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,350
Can you stop the war?

594
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,560
We're going to wipe out the Ago Tribe now.

595
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:44,773
Can you save Eunseom
with your psychic ability of the gods?

596
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,359
I asked if he saw you.

597
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,113
He didn't.

598
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,240
Because...

599
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,288
I hid like a fool.

600
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,695
What?

601
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,071
Goodness.

602
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:37,075
That horse has a better life than me.

603
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,785
He comes in whenever he wants.

604
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:42,873
It's as if he owns this place.

605
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,624
Then should we tie up a spirit?

606
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,418
You'll get punished.

607
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,503
WAHAN TRIBE, TANYA'S ASSOCIATE

608
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:53,383
Helper came all the way here alone
to find Tanya Niruha.

609
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,927
Spirit, my foot.

610
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,721
It's a bad horse nobody can ride.

611
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:03,685
Uh... By the way,
why do you keep talking casually to me?

612
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,770
We're close.

613
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,313
In Iark, we speak casually if we're close.

614
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,397
WAHAN TRIBE'S HOME

615
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,236
Niruha.

616
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,156
Doti.

617
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,160
I'm here to see Helper.

618
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,499
Helper.

619
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,047
Eunseom is the leader
of the Ago Union, Inaishingi.

620
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,597
The owner of your name commands.

621
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,350
Help Eunseom.

622
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,270
Save Eunseom. Please.

623
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,019
NEANTHAL

624
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,792
It's fine because it's dark.

625
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,002
I'll be quick.

626
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,045
You can't go out
without the head's permission.

627
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,130
NUNBYEOL'S OLDER SISTER, DOCTOR

628
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,716
He'll allow me to.
There's a type of herb I need.

629
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,687
Nunbyeol.

630
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:25,952
Since when did you become like this?
How long can you hold it?

631
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,412
Let my sister and me go.

632
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,289
Nunbyeol, stop.

633
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,423
Nunbyeol.

634
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,141
What's wrong with her?

635
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,434
You said it was complete.

636
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:52,145
It's because she used her powers.
She got too worked up.

637
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,814
If she draws up her power
through breathing,

638
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,359
she's a perfect Neanthal.

639
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,443
Breathing?

640
00:53:58,443 --> 00:53:59,527
MORE POWERFUL THAN SARAMS,
HAS BLUE BLOOD

641
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,238
How long until the perfect state?

642
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,781
About seven minutes.

643
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:10,163
Then can she beat
Tagon's monstrous strength?

644
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,791
She's the only Neanthal in the world
that uses swords.

645
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,543
What could beat her?

646
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:19,965
But there's no way
Tagon would wait for seven minutes.

647
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,468
What do you want?
Why do you want me to treat Nunbyeol?

648
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,720
Let us go. We'll leave quietly.

649
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,855
Will she leave too?

650
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,691
Hmm.

651
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,610
She can never give up.

652
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,612
That's right.

653
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,740
I can't give up.

654
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,993
I'm going to take revenge.

655
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,707
What do you want from us?

656
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,042
Tagon.

657
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,591
I want the same thing that she wants.

658
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:07,595
Listen carefully. I'll send you
into the palace as a servant.

659
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,097
Just wait for a while.

660
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,849
Without my command...

661
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,476
No.

662
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,104
You can call it a discussion.

663
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,065
Anyway, if you act as you please...

664
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:20,984
then...

665
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,779
your sister will be in danger.

666
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,990
Why will she be in danger?

667
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:32,579
Chaeeun will go
to the battlefield with me.

668
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:37,751
You better listen to me very well
and take care of me well.

669
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:42,130
From now on, our lives are one.

670
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:46,760
If I don't come back
to Arthdal safe and sound...

671
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:55,143
who knows what might be
in her food that she'll eat in the palace?

672
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:56,478
What?

673
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,108
So...

674
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:06,071
you guys are each other's hostage.

675
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:10,700
Also... we're all on the same side.

676
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,413
"My lady.

677
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,085
"How big is the world's sky?

678
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,712
"The sky in the tower...

679
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,799
"is too small.

680
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:31,096
"When my father comes,
will I be able to see the wide sky?"

681
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,185
Saya.

682
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:38,770
He was a poor thing.

683
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,107
A young child trapped
in a small space without his mom.

684
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,361
I never imagined I would see you alive.

685
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,445
Asa Yon.

686
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,450
Me neither.

687
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,538
I just follow Asa Sakan's wishes.

688
00:56:56,538 --> 00:57:00,166
I need the Children of Shahati.

689
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,668
WHITE MOUNTAIN
TRIBE'S SECRET ASSASSIN GROUP

690
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,003
Who do you want to send to God...

691
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,844
It's okay. She can neither hear nor speak.

692
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:11,928
I see.

693
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,222
Where should I send them to?

694
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,057
A battlefield.

695
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,963
This war is an opportunity

696
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,257
for me to become filthy rich.

697
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,512
Gosh,
there will be tons of war slaves.

698
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,932
We don't even have grains to eat.
War, my foot.

699
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,934
Just come back alive.
Protect Arthdal.

700
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,436
Dear God.

701
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,439
I just need to get through the war.

702
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,275
Please protect us.
Protect Arthdal.

703
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,985
Protect Arthdal.

704
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,806
This is my blood.

705
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,768
With this, your blood won't be shed.

706
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:45,897
With this, your army won't scatter

707
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,107
or collapse.

708
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:49,984
Airuju.

709
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,110
GREATEST OF THE EIGHT GODS OF ARTH

710
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,863
Protect all our warriors.

711
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:05,416
Come back alive,

712
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:07,961
Saya.

713
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,589
- What about Eunseom?
- Don't kill him.

714
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,217
He's your benetbeot.

715
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,383
NEAR HANCHOA CASTLE, AGO ARMY'S BARRACKS

716
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,594
- Where's Syoreujagin?
- I tied him up.

717
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,846
We need to make him spill
everything he knows.

718
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,474
We need to move to Pyeongmirae
in three days and get ready.

719
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,728
Mirusol will go to Pyeongmirae
to scout as soon as the sun rises.

720
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,229
The problem's bronze weapons.

721
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,525
We didn't fight properly, but the weapons
of those in front got damaged.

722
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,610
EUNSEOM'S ADVISER

723
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:17,030
We can't make bronze weapons
nor repair them.

724
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,867
After two or three more big fights,
things will get bad.

725
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,999
How many weapons are in Hanchoa Castle?

726
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,043
Tae Maja went to
Hanchoa Castle's armory to check.

727
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,127
WAHAN TRIBE, EUNSEOM'S FRIEND

728
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,211
When he comes back...

729
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,047
Let me go.

730
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,340
Darn it.

731
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,134
What happened?

732
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,429
She lives here in Hanchoa.

733
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,181
This punk...

734
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,725
beat him up like this.

735
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:47,602
Why?

736
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:51,522
He took something away,
and he attacked saying it was his.

737
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,318
I'm sorry.

738
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,071
I was feeling very elated because we won,

739
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,907
but he kept ruining the fun.

740
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:04,285
I lost my temper for a moment.

741
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,708
It won't happen again.

742
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,155
Please forgive him.

743
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,658
Don't do this.

744
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,576
We'll pay back what he took away.

745
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,705
We'll treat your injuries.

746
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,415
I forgive you.

747
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,250
I forgive you, of course.

748
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:03,594
Thank you.

749
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,021
You made Inaishingi kneel.

750
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:08,451
In my entire life, and even in stories,

751
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,703
I never heard of an army
that did not pillage.

752
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,623
But Eunseom is trying to do it.

753
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,876
We should do this much.

754
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,378
We must spread the word about
what happened today to everyone.

755
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,174
- That way, we Ago...
- Hey.

756
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,801
Even if you try to stop them...

757
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,885
TACHUKAN

758
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,387
...the news will spread
by tomorrow morning.

759
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,807
No. Not only to our army,
but to the enemies.

760
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,018
And everywhere around Arthdal.

761
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:36,646
You told us to spread rumors
that we were brutal.

762
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:41,067
We crossed the Notsan River.
They need to think differently now.

763
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,277
"They don't pillage.

764
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,112
"What's up with them?

765
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,782
"What kind of world do they want to make?"

766
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,451
So?

767
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,249
We should show them
the world we want to make.

768
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,628
And make them want the same thing.

769
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,096
I'm Cho Yakdu.

770
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,014
I'm Byeok Pungji.

771
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,517
They were dragged to Arthdal as slaves.

772
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,018
They know well about it.

773
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,186
Yes.

774
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,605
Well, we don't know that well.

775
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,524
But we do know what is where.

776
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,401
Inaishingi.

777
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,614
You look like Arthdals dressed like that.

778
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,077
But why...

779
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:36,080
You two will sneak into Arthdal.

780
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:39,458
And you need to meet someone.

781
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:41,752
Who?

782
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:44,005
Is it Tanya?

783
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,924
No.

784
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:49,135
That would be dangerous and difficult

785
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,220
since she's the High Priest.

786
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:52,972
Then...

787
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:55,808
Father Yeolson.

788
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,025
Relay this message.

789
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,610
I saved the Wahan Tribe

790
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,779
and I am going to Arthdal
to keep my promise.

791
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,917
Look forward and listen.

792
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,252
Enemy scouts are following us.

793
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,476
Chase him!

794
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,735
Catch him.

795
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:05,753
What should we do with him?

796
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:06,837
CHOMO

797
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:11,300
It's over for you guys.

798
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:25,356
Go back to Hanchoa.

799
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,149
Now.

800
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,164
Inaishingi.

801
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,791
You're finally here.

802
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,210
I'm glad you look happy.

803
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,087
Isn't it all thanks to me?

804
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:51,674
I told you
that you would need subordinates.

805
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:56,137
Yes, it's thanks to you.

806
01:06:56,137 --> 01:07:01,559
All 30 clans
of the Ago Tribe... Gosh.

807
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,145
Don't you have too many subordinates?

808
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,522
No. There's not enough.

809
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:10,901
By the way,
how did you get involved in that?

810
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,738
I had a trade with the Bato Tribe.

811
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,283
And the commander asked for my help.

812
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,410
So I played the mediator.

813
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,329
Then they said
they wanted to kill Inaishingi.

814
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,373
I thought this was my chance.

815
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,626
You must be sad that they failed.

816
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,633
By the way, do you think you'll win?

817
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:38,637
You don't know
how Arthdal warriors fight on plains.

818
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,730
We won't fight on the plains.

819
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:52,610
We'll fight in the forest
in front of Pyeongmirae Castle.

820
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:55,946
Oh... That's not a bad idea.

821
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:57,323
But do you even know...

822
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,451
who you're fighting?

823
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:05,498
Do you know

824
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:08,125
who was outside the tent?

825
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:13,255
Inaishingi.

826
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,842
Mirusol who went to scout has returned.

827
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,147
I didn't even get to the important part.

828
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:49,875
The troops of Arthdal

829
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,461
are placed from Dosuri River
to Pyeongmirae Castle.

830
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:56,423
Their troops seem
to be thrice as many as ours.

831
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,135
Isn't the supply chain cut off?

832
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,261
How...

833
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,680
How can they be this fast?

834
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,432
They left foot soldiers in Molabeol Castle
and only cavalry came.

835
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:06,517
MIRUSOL

836
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:11,272
- How much food do we have?
- If we cut back the rations...

837
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,356
SUHANA

838
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:13,482
...about five days.

839
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,488
It's a message from Arthdal.

840
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:31,917
"Warriors of the Ago Union.

841
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:35,713
"Do you want to starve for five days,
die within the stone walls,

842
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,506
"and wander in the dark?

843
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:41,385
"Or do you want to come
to Hanchoa Plains and be judged by Airuju

844
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:46,182
"and send your souls back
to the Agoha Forest?"

845
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:51,729
They were waiting for us
to attack Hanchoa.

846
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:52,813
Inaishingi.

847
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,441
We're at a disadvantage on the plains.

848
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:57,026
What should we do?

849
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,194
What else can we do?

850
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,904
We should fight on the plains.

851
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,155
That's the only way.

852
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,741
A way to death isn't a way.

853
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,284
We must find another way.

854
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:07,036
That other way

855
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:09,872
is starving to death inside
the stone walls.

856
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:12,208
I'll die fighting.

857
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:14,960
I won't let you die.

858
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:22,801
But one thing is that the Arthdal troops
placed themselves in Pyeongmirae so fast.

859
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:27,765
And another thing is that they know
that we have five days' worth of food.

860
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,266
Are you saying there's a yeomari?

861
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:30,351
YEOMARI: A SPY

862
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,812
I don't know.

863
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:36,440
But the information is being leaked
for sure.

864
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,317
Inaishingi.

865
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,818
What's urgent is right now.

866
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:41,695
Even if there's yeomari...

867
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:42,863
Of course.

868
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:43,948
The problem is...

869
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:48,744
can we win on the plains?

870
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:52,831
Yes, we can.

871
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:56,627
I'll tell you what we prepared
for a plains battle. First...

872
01:10:56,627 --> 01:11:00,089
From now until the battle,
everyone here

873
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,967
will eat and sleep together
with someone else.

874
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:09,348
Whoever is alone or disappears
is the enemy of the Ago Union.

875
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,031
What's wrong with them?

876
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:27,116
It's not only here.

877
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,618
All the horses
in the stables are going crazy.

878
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:32,454
They were calm after eating hay just now.

879
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:47,970
Helper.

880
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:06,488
Did you do this?

881
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,285
Stop it, Helper.

882
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,084
Tanya.

883
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:11,572
Eunseom.

884
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:18,388
Cavalry One!

885
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:19,681
Charge!

886
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,225
Let's go!

887
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:30,400
In the names
of the waterfall and the Agoha Forest!

888
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:33,820
Under the name of Inaishingi!

889
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:35,572
Let's go!

890
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:29,793
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

891
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:47,477
The general may be smart,
but he learned how to battle from books.

892
01:16:47,477 --> 01:16:49,771
He destroyed
Arthdal's most elite troops.

893
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:54,151
You're not the only one ruling Arthdal
with fear.

894
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,487
Inaishingi isn't my enemy.
He's Tagon's.

895
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:59,990
Actually, there was no reason
for you two to fight.

896
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,658
Join the Ago Union.

897
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:02,868
We can beat Tagon.

898
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,661
I want to know what happens next.

899
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:05,787
Where's Shahati?

900
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,081
It might be over by now.

901
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:11,460
This meeting
might change Arth's history.
