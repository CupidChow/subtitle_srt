1
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,966
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

2
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,010
Then is there any other way
besides them?

3
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:56,264
In the name of Xabara Karika,
I request repayment.

4
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,517
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

5
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,020
Big bellows,

6
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,439
a huge kiln, and bachis who can work.

7
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,858
If you have all of these,
how long will it take?

8
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,234
It will take about a dalpo.

9
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,404
Molabeol Castle is sturdy.

10
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,031
- It won't be easy.
No.

11
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,449
Not Molabeol Castle.

12
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,825
We'll attack Mobon Castle.

13
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,078
We'll attack Molabeol Castle immediately.

14
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,162
Molabeol Castle?

15
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,999
Charge!

16
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,169
Everyone, look.

17
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,505
I've prepared something for the general.

18
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,508
You said this, right?
You told me to kill everyone.

19
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,802
- Your Majesty.
- It's confusing, right?

20
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:37,639
Am I really crazy
or am I pretending to be crazy?

21
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,975
Tell me your plan.
- We'll kill Tagon and accept Inaishingi

22
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,477
into Arthdal.

23
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,145
You met Eunseom.

24
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,730
Your Majesty.

25
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,108
Come back to how you were before.

26
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,901
Stop now!

27
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,861
Is this why you became a king?

28
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,240
Execute Yeonbal and Gitoha
with Daeyok Punishment.

29
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,828
The king is possessed by a gosal.

30
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,205
His eyes are blurred
and his mind is confused,

31
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,749
so the sacred spirit
of Aramun has already left the king.

32
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,085
His evil grew
and brought upon a catastrophe.

33
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,213
I, General Saya, will slay that evil.

34
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,054
Your father died so unfairly.

35
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,305
How did you endure it?

36
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,723
I'll get revenge.

37
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,101
Do you think you can get revenge?

38
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,563
Some of them are not dead.

39
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,897
It's a trap.

40
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,442
It's pathetic.

41
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,862
What you missed tonight is...

42
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,245
REMEMBER MY FACE

43
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,298
I'm the strongest creature

44
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,675
in the world.

45
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:53,942
Come this way quickly!

46
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,026
Quickly!

47
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,955
Get out of my way!

48
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,725
CHAEEUN

49
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,362
ROYAL GUARD HEAD GILSEON

50
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,619
The king knew everything.

51
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,790
You were fooled by him.

52
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,959
Yes.

53
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,462
That's right.

54
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,514
COMMANDER SODANG

55
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,814
You're still as wise as ever.

56
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,899
If Tagon is dead,

57
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,111
you'll have to be wise this time.

58
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,952
That frail girl of an assassin?

59
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,580
I told you, he knows everything.

60
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,707
Who in Arthdal, no,

61
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,959
what Saram in this world

62
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,546
can fight the king alone and win?

63
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,882
I'm saying this

64
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,344
because she's not a Saram.

65
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,394
Do you know
what the worst thing you did was?

66
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,231
Killing a child's parents
in front of them.

67
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,735
Right in front of their eyes.

68
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,365
Father, Mother.

69
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,285
I'll send him to you now.

70
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,844
No, Arok. Run!

71
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,477
I told you to run.

72
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,020
Stop.

73
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,064
- Don't hurt Father.
Arok, hurry up!

74
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,649
Nunbyeol.

75
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,859
I'll die.

76
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,695
Don't harm Arok. Please!

77
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,114
I'll die.

78
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,616
I'll die.

79
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,992
Please let the children go.

80
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,911
I'm the only one that needs to die.

81
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,663
Just me!

82
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,789
I'll die.

83
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,999
Don't kill him.
Kill me!

84
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,960
Don't kill

85
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,795
my father.

86
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,547
Don't kill him.

87
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,798
Please.

88
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,135
Father did nothing wrong.

89
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,261
Please.

90
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,679
Don't kill him.

91
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,934
Don't hurt him.

92
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,227
Nunbyeol.

93
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,646
It's a trap.

94
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,772
We need to run away.

95
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,149
What are you doing here?

96
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,483
Hurry up!

97
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,818
The soldiers are coming!

98
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,944
No.

99
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,822
I must kill him.

100
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,616
You'll lose your strength soon.

101
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,827
Even if you kill him, you can't escape.

102
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,162
It's fine even if I don't.

103
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,385
You crazy wenches.

104
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,846
Drop the knife.

105
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,558
Back off. I said, back off.

106
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,895
Nunbyeol.

107
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,397
Niruha, you were right.

108
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,482
YANGCHA

109
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,983
Commanders Yeonbal and Gitoha were alive.

110
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,069
AGAJI

111
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,195
MOMYEONGJIN

112
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,794
- Arok.
- Father.

113
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,921
You shouldn't stand up.

114
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,381
You must rest--

115
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,216
I can't rest tonight.

116
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,013
I will be very busy tonight.

117
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,890
It may be hard to get some sleep,

118
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,850
but lie down, close your eyes,

119
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,811
and pretend you're walking in a forest.

120
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,690
Keep walking until a dream

121
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,899
comes to you.

122
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,485
I will, Father.

123
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:42,999
Your Majesty.

124
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,835
Those in front of the palace
have been subdued.

125
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,461
The queen has been arrested too.

126
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,590
As for the Neanthal,
we are looking for her, but--

127
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,092
- What about Saya?
- Lord Saya has been apprehended.

128
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,596
Out of all the rebels,
30% have died, 20% have escaped,

129
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,930
and the rest have surrendered.

130
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,932
The damage done
to the Third Corps is minor.

131
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,520
Right. Captains Pyeonmi
and Sanggal are dead.

132
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,524
And Bakryangpung ran away.

133
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,234
We're currently pursuing him.

134
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,121
Mother.

135
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,294
Step back, Prince Arok.
You must not come here.

136
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,172
Prince Arok, we must leave.

137
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,134
Royal Guard Mungtae.

138
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,802
Do you think

139
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,097
I will become a king in the future

140
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,223
or not?

141
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,020
Place your bet.

142
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,980
Which will you bet on?

143
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,149
Wait.

144
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,901
I just want to talk to him.

145
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,111
I don't know when I'll see him again.

146
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,738
What can I even do?

147
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,993
Mother.

148
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,752
Were you the one

149
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,129
who hurt Father?

150
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,302
I heard he's all right.

151
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,972
Both your father and I

152
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,266
are all right.

153
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,854
We might not be able
to see each other for a while...

154
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,068
but make sure to remember this...

155
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,905
I

156
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,074
will never die.

157
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,614
It has no smell.

158
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,242
Is this bichwisan?

159
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,203
A TYPE OF POISON THAT IS COLORLESS,
ODORLESS, AND TASTELESS

160
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,872
It's not a choice you would make.

161
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,915
This isn't a choice you would make either.

162
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:35,129
You wanted to get rid of me even if
it meant acting like you lost your mind.

163
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,091
I couldn't go to war
and leave Arthdal in your hands.

164
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,051
I had no choice.

165
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,473
Why don't you give that to me?

166
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,641
I lived my whole life

167
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,144
thinking I was the only one
who could save myself.

168
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,481
I also want to be the one
to end my own life.

169
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,274
That sounds plausible.

170
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,068
But not today.

171
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,284
You are Arok's mother.

172
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,204
Hae Yeobi, be more careful, will you?

173
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,330
HAE TUAK

174
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,915
HAE YEOBI

175
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,972
Go!

176
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,980
Niruha, the king will arrive soon.
Let's escape for now.

177
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,024
Go to Eunseom.

178
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,609
Go and give this to him.

179
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,486
And stay there for a while.

180
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,238
You want me to go to the Ago Tribe?

181
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,990
Isn't your mother there?

182
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,287
I knew it.

183
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,414
- What about you?
- I must stay.

184
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,749
And you must deliver this to Eunseom.

185
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,252
That's nonsense.
I'll get someone else to do it.

186
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,045
I'm trying to save you.

187
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,342
There's no way the king doesn't know
that you're involved. You'll die for sure.

188
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,263
But he cannot kill me.

189
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,850
In this game, whoever kills me loses.

190
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,688
When I decided to be on your side,

191
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,565
I was prepared to die.

192
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,734
I told you to be on my side in my fight.

193
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,068
I didn't tell you to die.

194
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,362
Nor am I going to let you.

195
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,780
But Tagon

196
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,033
will try to kill you first.

197
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,538
Your life is in the way
of the fight I need to fight now.

198
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,125
This is an order. Leave. Now.

199
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,337
Let me fight freely, Yangcha.

200
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,319
You know what it is, right?

201
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,281
I guess there's no way for me to live.

202
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,616
No.

203
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,076
There is.

204
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,129
It's this.

205
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,383
It's an iron sword.

206
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,804
There's only one way for you to live.
You have to let me win completely.

207
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,099
I've already lost.
What more do I need to lose?

208
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,475
Take this sword...

209
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,857
and kill Tanya.

210
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,610
There was a rebellion.

211
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,904
The rebels killed
the reincarnation of Asa Sin.

212
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,866
And the king suppressed the rebellion.

213
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,910
Externally, you'll be announced dead.

214
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,456
But I'll spare your life
and let you go far away.

215
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,505
What do you think?
Is it too hard to decide?

216
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,986
If you thought
that was difficult for me...

217
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,615
you really don't know me.

218
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,763
This is...

219
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,849
how we end.

220
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,353
Could there have been another way?

221
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,938
Back then...

222
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,900
Why did you bring me?

223
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,279
You could've just walked away
or killed me.

224
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,200
Back then...

225
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,204
I was younger than you are now...

226
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,414
and I was foolish.

227
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,291
If you didn't bring me here...

228
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,379
I apologize.

229
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,925
You're fake.

230
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,845
No. We are all...

231
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,055
fake.

232
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,558
You, the reincarnation of Aramun,

233
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,687
and I, who wanted to be your heir.

234
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,399
We're both fake.

235
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,445
Yes, we are all fake.

236
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,073
They're all legends.

237
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,370
No, it's not a legend.

238
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,507
The real one is coming.

239
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,967
The real Aramun.

240
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,525
You must've heard...

241
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,945
about Inaishingi riding Kanmoreu.

242
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,363
It's not Kanmoreu.

243
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,157
LEGENDARY HORSE RIDDEN BY ARAMUN

244
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,576
It must be some kind of a trick.

245
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,288
I might die here like this...

246
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,044
but you

247
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,338
will die at my hands.

248
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,175
Remember...

249
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,386
my face.

250
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,420
There will be no funeral.

251
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,297
Throw him away

252
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,509
so wild rats eat his eyes,

253
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,886
crows peck at his heart...

254
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,306
and his body rots away slowly.

255
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,946
MOLABEOL CASTLE, BLACKSMITH

256
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,919
How's the damage of our troops?

257
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,380
Thankfully, close to none.

258
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,464
MIRUSOL

259
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,633
Except one fool
who fell off the wall by accident.

260
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:46,138
All their troops have been sent to Mobon
and the general in charge ran away.

261
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,222
DALSAE

262
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,307
It was easy.

263
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,309
Inaishingi.

264
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,148
They'll start producing swords
with the iron from the meteorite...

265
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,232
CHOSAI - PASA

266
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,901
- ...so you'll get to see iron swords soon.
- That's right.

267
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:04,656
Those from Arthdal will be shocked when
they see iron swords on the battlefield.

268
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,792
I wonder how great
an iron sword we can make.

269
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,879
Iron swords are iron swords.
What do you mean?

270
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,089
The iron sword made by Father Yeolson

271
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,383
was much longer
than what we're trying to make.

272
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:28,597
Our iron swords might not be as strong.

273
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,891
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

274
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,518
We were stumped due to our weapons,
so this is great.

275
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,188
I'm very excited.

276
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,608
What's wrong?

277
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,488
Inaishingi, what will you do?

278
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,075
About Elder Suhana.

279
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,121
SUHANA

280
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,002
How clumsy.

281
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,087
CHOMO

282
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,297
- Do you actually feel pain?
- My heart.

283
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,299
My heart hurts.

284
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,426
I was such a fool.

285
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,183
- Inaishingi.
Inaishingi.

286
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,736
What was the point
of you destroying the castle wall?

287
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,490
He still climbed up there,
sprained his ankle,

288
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,991
and fell down.

289
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,786
Gosh, Suhana.

290
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,330
Will we be able to win?

291
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,208
Your words have power.

292
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,710
If you say we're going to win,
we will win.

293
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,423
Everything you say will come true.

294
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,426
Come to think of it,

295
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,303
the swallow tail spell
you taught me before

296
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,513
is something like that.

297
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,099
It makes what you say come true.

298
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,767
That's what spells are.

299
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,562
They create power with words.

300
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:08,738
Then...

301
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,200
shall we say this is you?

302
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,165
Pardon?

303
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,592
TACHUKAN

304
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,428
Continue.

305
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,347
When we crossed the Notsan River,

306
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,853
how did they know
we were heading to Pyeongmire?

307
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,607
Also, how did they know

308
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,568
about the military supply
of Hanchoa Castle?

309
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,612
Also, how did they know...

310
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,075
about our plan to attack Mobon Castle
and moved their troops?

311
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,912
Inaishingi.

312
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,747
What you're saying is--

313
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,831
I told you to continue!

314
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,260
I don't know what misunderstanding
has occurred,

315
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,179
but why are you doubting me?

316
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,435
What about this?

317
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,437
- I just thought...
- Don't explain.

318
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,814
- ...a sword like this would be nice--
- I drew it!

319
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,486
I drew this in Arthdal.

320
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,821
I simply drew this on the spot.

321
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:38,119
You must've received an order from Arthdal
to find someone using a sword like this.

322
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,793
Inaishingi, you're mistaken.

323
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,002
You shouldn't do this.

324
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,965
I'm the elder of the Tae Clan.
I'm worried about the union falling apart.

325
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,050
Tae Maja.

326
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,472
I, Tae Maja,
the heir of the Tae Clan's chief,

327
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,641
did as you ordered.

328
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,732
I followed you and caught this.

329
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,278
Since when was it?

330
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,822
When we took over Hanchoa Castle?

331
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,616
When we crossed the Notsan River? Or...

332
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,662
after the last unity with the Byeok Clan?

333
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,896
Since when?

334
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,065
Since when?

335
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,360
Thirty years.

336
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,196
It has been more than 30 years.

337
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,620
When I first arrived in the Agoha Forest,

338
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,041
when I got married
to the chief of the Tae Clan,

339
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,793
and when I became an elder,

340
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,754
I was always...

341
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,300
Tagon's person.

342
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,865
Lock her up.

343
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,460
THE GREAT SHRINE

344
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,383
The king has arrived.

345
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,945
I heard there was a big calamity
last night.

346
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:21,449
But you're safe,
so Airuju must have looked after you.

347
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,201
THE GREATEST OF ARTH'S EIGHT GODS

348
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,328
You're just as shameless as Asa Ron.

349
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,746
FORMER HIGH PRIEST

350
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,998
I'll consider that a compliment.

351
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:32,210
But I'm in the position to do so.

352
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,171
Do you really think I can't harm you?

353
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,674
If you really had lost your mind,

354
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,843
I would've been afraid.

355
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,304
But you have such a clear mind.

356
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:47,642
How can the reincarnation of Aramun
harm the descendant of Asa Sin?

357
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,728
ARTHDAL'S LEGENDARY DIVINE MOTHER

358
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,107
Do you really think so?

359
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,610
Aramun has been Asa Sin's messenger
for 200 years.

360
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,114
The moment you kill me, you're not Aramun.

361
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,576
As long as you're tied
to that grand name of Aramun,

362
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,119
you can't do anything to me.

363
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,621
I'm sure you know well.

364
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,001
You're right.

365
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,504
I can't do it myself.

366
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,967
So I told Saya that if he killed you
in the Great Shrine, I'd let him live.

367
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,511
But he did not hesitate.

368
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,557
Without hesitation, he drank bichwisan.

369
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,518
What, didn't you know?

370
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,855
I thought you would have known
with your psychic ability of the gods.

371
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,398
Saya is dead.

372
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,069
So things have become bothersome.

373
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,198
When you died,

374
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,659
I was going to build a huge statue of you.

375
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,622
So my plans have changed.

376
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,585
You'll become a god instead of a statue,
like that Airuju.

377
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,755
Airuju doesn't appear
in the world directly.

378
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,007
We can neither see, touch,

379
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,511
nor hear Airuju's voice.

380
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,764
You cannot go out into the world anymore.

381
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,683
Only I will deliver your thoughts,

382
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:14,437
God's thoughts, to the people.

383
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,444
I see you helped Yangcha escape.

384
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,988
Good job.

385
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,951
I was going to tear off his limbs
one by one in front of you,

386
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,538
and kill him slowly for a long time.

387
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,086
Right.

388
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,591
Pray a lot for me.

389
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,387
Molabeol Castle has been taken over.

390
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,851
Inaishingi has advanced
right in front of Arthdal.

391
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,773
Molabeol Castle?

392
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,860
They'll reach Arthdal
as soon as they pass the Arth Forest.

393
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,028
Commander.
You let those beasts take over the castle?

394
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,446
COMMANDER GITOHA
COMMANDER DUPA

395
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,573
I have no excuse.

396
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,657
YEOLSON

397
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,994
What about that iron sword thing?
I heard it is a great weapon.

398
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,872
They will be distributed to every soldier
in the near future.

399
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,083
Well, then we have nothing to worry about.

400
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,502
They were of no match to begin with,

401
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,881
and now we'll be armed
with iron swords too.

402
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,299
Nothing to worry about.

403
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,217
The Ago Tribe will make them too.

404
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,262
Your Majesty.

405
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,351
Your Majesty.

406
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,812
Did you say the Ago Tribe
will make iron swords?

407
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,398
- How can they--
- A bachi of the Hae Tribe

408
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,150
is helping them.

409
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,070
Then we don't know
how the war will unfold now.

410
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,405
You're going too far.

411
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,158
They have strong momentum,

412
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,743
but they're Ago's beasts.

413
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,162
We don't have Great Commander Mubaek.

414
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,664
Who will lead the army now?

415
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,083
Don't you understand, Minister?

416
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,555
Yeonbal, Gitoha.

417
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,515
Yes, Your Majesty.

418
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,435
I'll lead the commanders of Arthdal
to the battlefield

419
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,064
and wash our brothers' bodies
with the blood of Inaishingi.

420
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,401
I, Tagon, the reincarnation of Aramun
and king of Arthdal,

421
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,529
will lead the troops and go to war myself

422
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,574
in the year of the hungry snake,
the month of the dog.

423
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,493
A KING LEADING THE TROOPS

424
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,595
Faster!

425
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,222
HAE KKADAK

426
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,598
Be more careful

427
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,559
with all your heart and soul.

428
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,436
It will change the history...

429
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,063
MIRUSOL, BADORU

430
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,314
...of the continent.

431
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,110
What's with him?
Why is he acting like that?

432
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,989
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

433
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,910
Hey.

434
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,412
Aren't you leaving?

435
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,707
That galma or whatever is resolved,
so get lost now.

436
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,874
Get lost?

437
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,544
Goodness.

438
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,629
Your attitude
has completely changed now.

439
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,549
Who took out all of those?

440
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,385
- I did.
- Then just take them back

441
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,137
- with you.

442
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,349
You're getting in my way, so get out.

443
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,600
I was just...

444
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,810
Get out.

445
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,478
Get out.

446
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,833
Again.

447
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,353
Do you want to join us?

448
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,230
You startled me.

449
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,441
Join you for what?

450
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,027
Are you serious, Inaishingi?

451
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,487
Yes. Join us.

452
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,032
As you said,
the history of the continent will change.

453
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,367
You want to join us, don't you?

454
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,288
Mm... Actually...

455
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,166
Yes, that's true.

456
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,377
But I can't do that.

457
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,338
Why?

458
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,256
Is it because of the galma?

459
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,341
EVERYTHING TO REPAY

460
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,384
That's right, galma.

461
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:00,973
I took revenge for my brother and I
returned the favor of the golden shell.

462
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,684
So I'm a jejeki now.

463
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,353
Jejeki?

464
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,815
"Jeje" means a newborn baby
in Momo language. What does that mean?

465
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,983
A newborn baby-like state.

466
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,362
I have no favor nor enemy, like a baby.

467
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:18,032
In the Momo Tribe, when babies die,
they go to the Land of Light.

468
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,202
If I die now,
I'll go to the Land of Light too.

469
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,372
But if I join you,

470
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,456
that would be...

471
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,127
forming such a huge galma again.

472
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,425
I see. If that's the case, so be it.

473
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,845
Goodbye.

474
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,765
I had fun.

475
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,896
But...

476
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,527
That galma of the Momo Tribe...

477
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,489
- Isn't it strange?
- What's strange about it?

478
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,535
Not receiving any favors,
not helping anyone,

479
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,746
not getting harmed,
and not harming anyone.

480
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,124
How can you live like that?

481
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,253
When a Saram lives among fellow Sarams,

482
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,754
isn't that all galma?

483
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,341
Living itself...

484
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,510
is galma.

485
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,888
So it can be painful,

486
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,766
but you become happy, get comforted,

487
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,269
and feel overwhelmed.

488
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:48,247
The queen has been confined
and I think Lord Saya is really dead.

489
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,041
And...

490
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,792
a lot of people.

491
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,629
It's strange.

492
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,382
I cannot feel Saya's death.

493
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,009
I can't believe it either.

494
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,303
How did he die so futilely?

495
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,474
Eunseom advanced to Molabeol,

496
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,143
Tagon is going to war now,

497
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,979
and Taealha has been confined.

498
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,406
Please call Moa.

499
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,086
I have some questions.

500
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,755
I was ordered not to tell you anything.

501
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,131
It's nothing much.

502
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,258
I'm just curious.

503
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,928
What happened to Saya and the Hae Tribe?

504
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,429
I don't know anything.

505
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,481
Whatever you say,

506
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,358
I can't do anything about it in here.

507
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,696
Yeobi escaped.

508
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,873
My goodness.

509
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,333
It smells so good.

510
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,543
This is yours too.

511
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,670
What happened to Saya?

512
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,630
Lord Saya is dead.

513
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:24,260
Still, the king was generous,
so he died by drinking poison.

514
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,637
- Poison?
- Yes.

515
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,806
Was it the bichwisan
he took away from you?

516
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,808
He gave it to Lord Saya to kill himself.

517
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:32,935
Mahasin.

518
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,020
HAE TRIBE'S POISON

519
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,479
I have to get going now.

520
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,444
What about his body?
What happened to Saya's body?

521
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:46,032
GAMBAL MOUNTAIN

522
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,112
Here.

523
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,408
Did you tell her that Yeobi escaped?

524
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,951
Yes, then she told me

525
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,245
to put this in a red jar
in the pottery place.

526
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,501
We did it.

527
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,421
Send soldiers to go hide there
and wait for Yeobi to appear.

528
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,839
I understand.

529
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,341
Good job.

530
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,014
What is this smell?

531
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,724
Oh.

532
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,268
The queen gave this to me.

533
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,646
Let me take this at least.

534
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,902
It says that
the queen herself is still safe,

535
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,489
and that Yeobi should not
act hastily and wait for her order

536
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,282
while keeping a low profile.

537
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,869
While I'm at war,

538
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:17,123
Gilseon will be in charge
of all the soldiers in Arthdal.

539
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,751
I will, Your Majesty.

540
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,378
As for all the events in Arthdal,

541
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,171
Minister Chojaha will be in charge.

542
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,091
I will do my best, Your Majesty.

543
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,718
There's no Bronze Workshop now.

544
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,387
It's the Iron Workshop.

545
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,721
Make iron swords nonstop.

546
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,181
Yes, of course.

547
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,350
But Your Majesty.

548
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,894
I dare ask you this question
by risking my life.

549
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,897
What will happen to High Priest Niruha?

550
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,027
Are you worried about your daughter?

551
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,615
High Priest Niruha.
I heard you were looking for me.

552
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,617
Yes. Have a seat.

553
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,664
Things didn't work out well, did they?

554
00:40:58,664 --> 00:40:59,790
MOA

555
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,958
Are you all right?

556
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,793
Of course I am.

557
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,839
Today's story is about
when Aramun Haesulla was a child.

558
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,716
Would you like to listen?

559
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,967
I would like to,

560
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,972
but I heard you can't even leave
the Great Shrine from now on.

561
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,516
I'm worried about you.

562
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,561
There's nothing to worry about.

563
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,314
Now...

564
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,484
the first descendant of Asa Sin

565
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,819
to the second descendant of Asa Sin.

566
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,863
The second descendant of Asa Sin

567
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,573
hears God's voice.

568
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,315
We'll march day and night without a break,

569
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,859
so let the horses and soldiers
have plenty of rest.

570
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,111
I will do so, Your Majesty.

571
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,781
I will adopt the strategy
proposed by Yeonbal.

572
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,699
- Proceed as is.
Yes, Your Majesty.

573
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,409
I will give my life to make it succeed.

574
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,787
Also...

575
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,546
What is wrong?

576
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,049
Gilseon was fooled

577
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,133
by Taealha.

578
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,112
If you scream, you'll die.

579
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,657
If you understood, nod.

580
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,035
You're a banbitgan servant, right?

581
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,870
PALACE KITCHEN

582
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,164
What did the queen say?

583
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,918
What do you mean?

584
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,336
I've never met the queen--

585
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,715
This smell

586
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,967
that reeks from you.

587
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,430
There's only one Saram in Arthdal
who uses this scent.

588
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,933
Do you think the queen gave you
this sachet by chance?

589
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,520
She gave you this so I could find you,
you fool.

590
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,815
Please spare me. I'm sorry.

591
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,525
What did you talk about with her?

592
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,569
Nothing much.

593
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,654
I just told her that
Lord Saya passed away...

594
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,739
Lord Saya

595
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,532
passed away?

596
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:43,495
Yes. The king gave Lord Saya bichwisan
and ordered him to kill himself.

597
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,830
Bichwisan?

598
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,293
Why does the king have bichwisan?

599
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,253
I heard he took it away from the queen.

600
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,672
Was it the one...

601
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,133
the queen had?

602
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,885
Yes, that was what I heard.

603
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,638
Where's the corpse?

604
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:13,859
Gosh.

605
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:17,404
It's a ring. It's a ring.

606
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,333
Done? Let's go.

607
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,893
Do you really have no affection for Ago?
You've been here for over 30 years.

608
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,355
Why do you follow Tagon?

609
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,568
All your families, friends, and comrades
are in the Ago Tribe.

610
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,737
Don't waste your breath on me.

611
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,158
Just kill me, Inaishingi.

612
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,627
I caught a man from Arthdal,
and he wishes to meet you.

613
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,337
He came here of his own volition.

614
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,716
What is his name?

615
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:45,385
Yang? Yangcha?

616
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,388
That was it.
He said you'd know if I told you his name.

617
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,077
Saya is dead?

618
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,038
That was what I heard.

619
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,040
It would be strange for him to be alive.

620
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,590
- What about Tanya?
- She's still alive.

621
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,346
Niruha sent you this.

622
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,405
Is there a plan to save Niruha
in this war?

623
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,241
It's beyond my power now.

624
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,659
Only you can save Niruha.

625
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,414
Tell me. Do you or do you not have a plan
to save Niruha?

626
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,001
Lock him up.

627
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,882
What are you playing at, Inaishingi?

628
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,092
I must go back to Arthdal!

629
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,887
I have to go back to Arthdal!

630
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,598
You tried to kill Inaishingi.

631
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,850
So you must've risked your life
to come here.

632
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,269
- Keep an eye on him.
Yes, sir.

633
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,577
Yangcha.

634
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,204
You're Yangcha, right?

635
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,167
Yangcha.

636
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,753
Don't pretend like you know me.

637
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,046
Why are you--

638
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,089
Why are you locked up? Did they find out?

639
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,717
How did you come here?

640
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,470
There was a rebellion to kill King Tagon.

641
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,680
Is the king safe?

642
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,224
I was the rebel.

643
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,310
What?

644
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,354
Just why...

645
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,649
How can you betray him?
Have you gone crazy?

646
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,193
Who saved you when you were
dragged away by the Shahati?

647
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,320
Who saved our lives?

648
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,655
Why did you--

649
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,989
Someone I want to protect.

650
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,284
There's someone I want to protect
with my life.

651
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,121
So stop being a yeomari because of me.

652
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,710
She's different from King Tagon.

653
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,296
I want to follow her, be like her,

654
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,173
and treasure her.

655
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,094
I believe in the world
she wants to create.

656
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,138
Is it a woman?

657
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,267
Did you develop affection for her?

658
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,229
Did your emotions come back that much?

659
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:46,024
What about the black hue on your tongue?

660
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:47,651
It disappeared.

661
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,322
It was time that got rid of the black hue,

662
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:56,034
but she was the one who gave me back
my emotions that the Shahati took away.

663
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,497
So, Mother, make choices for yourself now.

664
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,049
I need to meet Inaishingi.

665
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,052
Why did you lock him up with Suhana?

666
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,055
I wondered
if he could open Suhana's mouth.

667
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,310
- He's her son.
- What?

668
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,899
Inaishingi. Suhana wishes to meet you.

669
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,320
Save Yangcha.

670
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:36,742
Then I'll give you
all the information I know.

671
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,494
You'll betray Tagon because of your son?

672
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:43,790
King Tagon won't lose to Ago
just because he failed once.

673
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,753
It better be worth that much.

674
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,880
The lives of thousands
of the Ago warriors.

675
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,341
Is that worth enough?

676
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,596
At the upcoming night of the full moon,

677
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,849
Arthdal's army will pass the Arth Forest

678
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,518
and raid the South Gate
of Molabeol Castle.

679
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,145
I was ordered

680
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,272
to set fire
to the military warehouse here,

681
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,317
and open the gates that night.

682
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,778
Don't listen to her.

683
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,739
Arthdal hasn't attacked the Agoha Forest
for the past 200 years

684
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,825
because we, the Ago Tribe,
have never lost in the forests.

685
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,869
Yes. It's a lie.

686
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,830
Why would Arthdal go through the forest
to attack the castle?

687
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,625
- They'll fight us in the field.
- The horse of the heavens.

688
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,336
That horse changed everything.

689
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,006
And more importantly...

690
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,091
More importantly?

691
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,009
I'll tell you if you release Yangcha.

692
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,932
You better come quickly

693
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,809
- if you want to save Niruha.
- Go.

694
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,703
Now tell us
what the more important information is.

695
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,293
- What?
- Tagon will join the war himself.

696
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,838
Also, he will lead the ambush
at the forefront.

697
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,465
Can we trust her?

698
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,885
Ever since Aramun Haesulla lost
in the Agoha Forest 200 years ago,

699
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:22,514
Arthdal has never fought us
in forests or mountains.

700
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,810
So the Arthdal troops have never come
near the Agoha Forest for all those years.

701
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,855
But Tagon will lead the troops
and pass the Arth Forest?

702
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,148
One thing is for sure.

703
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,819
Arthdal will never fight us
in forests or mountains.

704
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,821
This is a natural belief.

705
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,990
If what Suhana said is true,

706
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,160
Tagon caught us completely off guard.

707
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,120
She was a yeomari for dozens of years.

708
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,957
Would she have told us
something so important?

709
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,962
All we lose by preparing
is just a bit of extra work.

710
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:57,591
But if we can ambush Tagon in the forest,

711
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,429
we have the chance to end this war
by shedding the least amount of blood.

712
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,266
That's right.
Them not coming is the problem.

713
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,143
We should pray for them to come.

714
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,521
Instead of just doubting her,
let's set a trap and wait.

715
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,274
If they come,
we'll show them how fierce we are.

716
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,568
I'm the best in forests, you know.

717
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,987
I've never heard of that before.

718
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,492
If they come in to the Arth Forest,
the forest will become their graves.

719
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:33,460
THE GREAT SHRINE

720
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,971
Niruha is waiting for you.

721
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,224
Follow me.

722
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,591
It was just as he said.

723
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,386
He said you would definitely come back.

724
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,888
You should thank the gods
that the king isn't here.

725
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,225
If he was, you would've died on the spot.

726
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,394
Did he go to war?

727
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:36,564
Commander, there is no suspicious
movement from the Arth Forest to Molabeol.

728
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,191
The Agos are warriors of forests.

729
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,695
It would be hard to tell
even if they were waiting in ambush.

730
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,072
Look again.
Don't leave a single stone unturned.

731
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,532
Yes, Commander.

732
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,041
Commander Yeonbal.

733
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,460
I really don't know
if this is the right strategy.

734
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,796
They're incredibly skilled in forests.

735
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,048
What if something happens in the forest?

736
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:06,511
Moreover, the king got rid
of all the cavalry from this operation.

737
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,639
It's because of that horse
that Inaishingi rides.

738
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,850
Still, fighting without cavalry is...

739
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,643
It's just a forest anyway.

740
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,855
Have faith in the king.

741
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:44,299
NORTH OF THE ARTH FOREST,
THE TRAP ZONE OF THE AGO TRIBE

742
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,635
TAE DACHI

743
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,037
They're here.

744
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,125
- Where's Tagon?
- The king's flag...

745
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,711
is at the forefront.

746
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,933
What's with your expression?

747
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,937
What about my expression?

748
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,315
I'm excited to go back to Marugin.

749
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,734
Didn't you want to leave?

750
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:49,155
That's not it.

751
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,536
What Inaishingi said bothers me.

752
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,748
Do you know what he said?

753
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,000
He said living itself was galma.

754
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,753
What does he know? He's arrogant.

755
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:07,590
Right? He's just Inaishingi,
nothing special.

756
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:11,177
Actually, I think about that every day.

757
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,054
Me too.

758
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,098
Right? That's true.

759
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,476
Actually, I've thought about that too.

760
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,897
No matter how careful you are,
you cannot avoid galma.

761
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,234
If you can't avoid it, what should you do?

762
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,571
Move forward and don't be afraid.

763
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:32,198
That's what you were thinking too, right?

764
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,701
Not that specifically.

765
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:40,415
No. All of us in the Momo Tribe
have thought about that.

766
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,543
He's showing off with something...

767
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,671
that everyone thinks about.

768
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,306
What's that?

769
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,683
They're Arthdal's troops.

770
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:20,705
See? Another galma has been formed.

771
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,691
If we can't avoid it, what should we do?

772
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,985
Move forward.

773
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,820
Do not be afraid.

774
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:58,076
Kill them!
Do not let anyone who saw us live.

775
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,227
Do not be afraid!

776
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,328
They were from the Momo Tribe.

777
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,623
Of all things...

778
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,791
- On top of that, one escaped?
Yes.

779
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,044
But our ambush could have been discovered.

780
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,922
Things could become complicated.

781
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,675
After Kansareu Niruha,

782
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,970
there are two diplomacy principles
about the Momo Tribe.

783
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:44,349
First. Do not lay your hands
on the Momo Tribe.

784
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,559
Two.

785
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,937
- Say it.
- If you do,

786
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,523
annihilate them.

787
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,943
After the war with the Ago Tribe is over,

788
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:59,238
I will conquer the Marugin archipelago
and the Moshaho peninsula,

789
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,282
and annihilate the Momo Tribe.

790
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,743
How are the preparations?

791
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:05,870
They are perfect.

792
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,337
The real one is coming.

793
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,339
The real Aramun.

794
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,593
The real Aramun.

795
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,615
Inaishingi.

796
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,492
How did it go?

797
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,911
Arthdal's army has passed through
the Chestnut Forest.

798
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,414
Where's Tagon?

799
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,623
At the forefront.

800
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,166
I checked...

801
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,752
his face.

802
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,388
Tagon is here.

803
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:07,890
It's a godsent opportunity.

804
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,103
We can catch Tagon here.

805
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,147
We must catch him

806
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,482
and we can catch him.

807
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,946
We must hold him accountable

808
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,407
for driving a wedge

809
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,034
between the Ago Tribe
by planting a yeomari,

810
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,120
and for making the Ago Tribe

811
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,289
kill and sell

812
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,374
each other's brothers, sisters,

813
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,544
fathers, and mothers.

814
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,299
This is a forest and a mountain.

815
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,093
Forests and mountains

816
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,846
are always on the Ago Tribe's side.

817
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,061
In the name of the waterfall,

818
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,647
victory to all!

819
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:46,072
- Stop.
- Stop.

820
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,626
Are there bush warblers on this mountain?

821
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,127
Well,

822
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,505
I'm not sure.

823
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,315
All soldiers, retreat quietly.

824
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,615
- It's an ambush.
- It's an ambush.

825
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:10,156
All soldiers, retreat.

826
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,992
Protect the king.

827
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,412
Make way. Make way!

828
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,752
Make way!

829
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,395
Protect the king!

830
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,440
Do not let Tagon escape.

831
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:47,818
Tachukan!

832
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,102
Mirusol!

833
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:17,950
We'll go to Baranggil,
cut them off and catch Tagon.

834
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,785
- Let's go.
Yes, sir.

835
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:28,794
Karat.

836
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:31,672
What's wrong? What happened?

837
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:45,728
Catch him!

838
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,575
How lame.

839
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,785
Are you giving up now?

840
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,790
You must be Tachukan.

841
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,792
Yes, Tachukan.

842
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:11,045
That's the name of the person
who will behead you. Isn't that something?

843
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:15,883
Do you realize that you have come out
to the field while chasing me?

844
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,134
What?

845
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:18,844
What difference does that make?

846
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:21,013
I don't see Inaishingi...

847
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,766
and his horse of the heavens.

848
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:26,685
What a pity.

849
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,312
I don't know what you're saying,

850
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,316
but your head will be offered
to the waterfall.

851
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,777
- Stop!

852
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,415
You're going to Baranggil, right?

853
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,210
Inaishingi.

854
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:52,795
I think

855
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,964
you guys have fallen into a trap.

856
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,467
What do you mean?

857
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:00,886
Below the hill...

858
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,766
of the Dalrae Plains...

859
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,233
...countless Arthdal soldiers

860
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,861
were hiding.

861
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,897
My gosh.

862
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:58,235
I tried not to get entangled
up in galma and ended up like this.

863
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,989
But there's nothing I can do.

864
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,073
I am...

865
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:05,075
Karat...

866
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:07,328
of Momo.

867
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:11,582
I have a favor to ask.

868
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:20,299
Send my brothers...

869
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,302
to the Land of Light.

870
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:28,849
Win...

871
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:31,560
Inaishingi.

872
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,265
All forces.

873
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:11,350
Pass the Dolgae Hill

874
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:13,269
and advance to Baranggil.

875
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,063
Pass the Dolgae Hill
with all our soldiers?

876
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,481
How can we do that?

877
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:20,776
If we don't,
Mirusol and Tachukan will die.

878
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,362
Yes, Badoru. This is a forest.

879
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:25,739
We, the Ago Tribe, can do it.

880
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,917
You can't.

881
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:40,296
It's the plan you came up with.

882
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,547
But that is

883
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:43,924
too dangerous.

884
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:47,761
The Ago Tribe isn't stupid.

885
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,639
Will they fall for your decoy?

886
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,852
But if I become the bait...

887
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:58,689
it might succeed.

888
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,282
All forces, draw your swords!

889
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,706
All forces, charge!

890
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:51,742
Damn it.

891
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:56,288
Why are these bastards' swords so long?

892
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,461
Whether they're long or short,
break through the siege!

893
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:03,629
Break through it!

894
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:27,820
Move aside.

895
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:30,572
You can't even kill a beast, you pig.

896
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,783
You try it, you bastard.

897
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,993
He's no joke.

898
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:57,891
Tachukan!

899
01:13:58,475 --> 01:13:59,518
Mirusol!

900
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:10,779
No way.

901
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:13,157
How can they appear from there?

902
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,533
And on horses too?

903
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:21,748
In the name of Ago and the waterfall!

904
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,385
Inaishingi!

905
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,304
Inaishingi!

906
01:14:55,115 --> 01:14:56,992
We have a lot more soldiers.

907
01:14:57,784 --> 01:14:59,077
Don't get pushed back!

908
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:02,664
Armored infantry, maintain your positions!

909
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:42,454
He must be Inaishingi.

910
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,213
Your Majesty, stop!

911
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,762
Inaishingi!

912
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,833
I might die here like this.

913
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:31,920
But you will die at my hands.

914
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:33,505
Remember...

915
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:36,842
my face.

916
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:57,404
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

917
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:15,922
Eunseom hasn't been captured,

918
01:17:15,922 --> 01:17:17,883
but everyone says the fight is over.

919
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:19,676
Hand over Kanmoreu.

920
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:23,388
Do you think you'll become the owner
of that name just by having Kanmoreu?

921
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:25,682
Aramun!
I don't need stuff like that.

922
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:27,225
I am Tagon!

923
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:30,145
I will break off that chain today.

924
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,814
It was an amazing strategy,
but it failed.

925
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,775
Now, the Ago Tribe is like a bug

926
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,735
that won't even leave a trace
when stepped on.

927
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:38,570
If the Ago army gets annihilated,

928
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:42,032
and Inaishingi survives alone,
that's not Inaishingi anymore.
