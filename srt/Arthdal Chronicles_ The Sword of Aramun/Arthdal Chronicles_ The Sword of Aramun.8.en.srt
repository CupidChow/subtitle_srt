1
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:49,966
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

2
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,968
Is there a reason
I shouldn't kill you?

3
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,014
- Let's form an alliance.
- Why should I?

4
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,766
That is the only way you can win.

5
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,644
Arthdal will be armed
with iron swords soon.

6
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,730
I'll call it the Sword of Seed.

7
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,984
The seed of blood, death, and prosperity.

8
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,819
Arthdal made iron swords?

9
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,155
I heard there was a meteorite
made of pure iron.

10
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,450
- Is there something?
- There is.

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,786
Sarams cannot hold their breaths
for that long.

12
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,455
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

13
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:24,209
He's Karat of the Momo Tribe.
And he is Xabara's beogeumbari.

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,883
Have you never heard
about Saya's benetbeot?

15
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,177
Was this a dream or reality?

16
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,845
Answer me!

17
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,680
Your Majesty.

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,141
I suppose it was just a dream.

19
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,526
You should give me more. For example,
the whole of Arthdal?

20
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,070
Kill Tagon and enthrone Arok.

21
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,322
- What will you get?
- Tanya.

22
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,575
You came here for this?

23
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,244
Did you steal it?

24
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,583
You'll take revenge.

25
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,877
And I will get Arthdal.

26
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,964
We will kill Tagon now.

27
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:22,642
THE STRONGEST CREATURE IN THE WORLD

28
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,811
I'll explain everything.

29
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,895
Tell me your plan.

30
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,107
How will you...

31
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,985
take over Arthdal?

32
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,329
The original plan we made with Mubaek.

33
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,875
We'll kill Tagon, take down Taealha,

34
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,711
and we,
the three children of the prophecy,

35
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,838
will take over this world.

36
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,012
It's been a long time.

37
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,680
High Priest Niruha.

38
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,228
Are you

39
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,313
Nunbyeol?

40
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,356
NUNBYEOL

41
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,034
Based on your reaction,
it seems like you've made a big decision.

42
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,162
Why did you come back now
when you were alive?

43
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,580
Didn't you like it that way?

44
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,916
How Eunseom and I were swapped?

45
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,754
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,089
What happened to Nunbyeol?

47
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,967
What will you do
with that weak and delicate child?

48
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,305
I can't tell you in detail,
but that's very funny.

49
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,766
"Weak and delicate."

50
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,644
Those corpses were all Igutus.

51
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,313
MIXED BLOOD
BETWEEN SARAM AND NEANTHAL

52
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,776
Why? It's the world of Igutus now.

53
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,986
You said

54
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,989
purple blood was bestowed
upon us as a proof of blessing.

55
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,449
Furthermore...

56
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,911
the sword of Aramun appeared.

57
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,042
Saya. You clearly said,
"the three children of the prophecy."

58
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,460
What is your plan?

59
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,840
The war between Arthdal
and the Ago Tribe is unavoidable.

60
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,219
Nobody can stop this big war.

61
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,596
There is only one way.

62
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,931
What is that?

63
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,891
You and I will kill Tagon

64
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,895
and accept Inaishingi into Arthdal.

65
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,607
You...

66
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,360
met Eunseom.

67
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,488
Yes.

68
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,698
We became allies.

69
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,326
For you who detests blood.

70
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,704
Only for you, Tanya.

71
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,007
High Priest Niruha.

72
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,218
We benetbeot brothers
will make this land peaceful

73
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,054
with the least amount of blood...

74
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,348
for you.

75
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,478
WARRIOR OF THE MOMO TRIBE

76
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,939
You've done well until now.

77
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,608
You've held it in well, right?

78
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,734
MIRUSOL

79
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,444
That bastard will never help us.

80
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,197
Then is there any other way besides them?

81
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,281
TACHUKAN

82
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,366
Give it your all, okay?

83
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,909
If you actually have a talk with him...

84
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,993
TAE DACHI

85
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,411
...you won't be able to say that.

86
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,707
He may have
a potty mouth as dirty as feces,

87
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,543
but the life of
the Ago Tribe lies in his hands.

88
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,045
That's right.

89
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,882
If it's too hard,
let's just think of him as a talking fish.

90
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,510
Hey. I'm most worried about you.

91
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,262
Everyone, keep this in mind.

92
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,266
Until Ipsaeng comes back,
we'll do what we need to do.

93
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,688
Let's go in.

94
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,371
He's not standing up.

95
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,497
Hey.

96
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:58,126
He's your Inaishingi, not mine.

97
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:02,004
And I came here because you asked,
not because I wanted.

98
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,757
Yes, you are right.

99
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,766
How do you like the food?

100
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,063
They all stink.

101
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,940
If they stink, stop eating--

102
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,150
Take a walk.

103
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,028
Then I'll take back all the food here

104
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,572
and serve you something else.

105
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,031
You don't have to.

106
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,243
Anything the Ago Tribe touches stinks.

107
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,078
It stinks of blood.

108
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,041
Why is that so?

109
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,210
The Ago Tribe of 30,000 became one

110
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,464
and Inaishingi was reincarnated.
That's why it stinks.

111
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,384
Doldambul, Geomeuldun,
and the Hanchoa Plains.

112
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,514
The places you lot passed by
reek of blood.

113
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,481
We, the Ago Tribe, were treated
brutally by Arthdal for a very long time.

114
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,565
We have to fight.

115
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,484
We cannot continue to be mistreated.

116
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,988
You should've done well from the start,
but you sold your siblings away before.

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,161
We, the Ago Tribe,

118
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,538
have a favor to ask you.

119
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:21,250
We, the Momo Tribe,
do not wish to do you a favor.

120
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,131
Whatever it is.

121
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,676
We fed you, treated you,
and did everything you asked.

122
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,930
I knew something was up. Look.

123
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,516
You had an ulterior motive, didn't you?

124
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,017
Huh?

125
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,187
When I soaked myself in water yesterday,
I felt leery.

126
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,980
What is this?

127
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,732
Is your Xabara's son, Hotau doing well?

128
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,108
CHIEF OF THE MOMO TRIBE

129
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,027
Who saved his life?

130
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,988
If you get involved in your galma thing,
you have to repay, right?

131
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,782
EVERYTHING TO REPAY, MOMO LANGUAGE

132
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,158
That galma was resolved

133
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,995
when the Xabara saved your Inaishingi
from the waterfall.

134
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,997
Have you forgotten already?

135
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,667
Then what is it you want?

136
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,127
If you do me a favor

137
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,255
and ask for repayment, I can't help it.

138
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,883
I'm from the Momo Tribe,
and I need to repay it.

139
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:16,847
But there's no favor I can receive
from a tribe as pathetic as the Ago Tribe.

140
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,225
So there's no way. Right?

141
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,893
Inaishingi.

142
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,979
He will never help us.

143
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,190
He just came here to mock and insult us.

144
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,526
Please don't ask him anymore.

145
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,826
This is interesting.

146
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,831
Then what about this?

147
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,958
This is the Ago Tribe's land now.

148
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,838
Everyone in the Ago Tribe's land
must obey Inaishingi's orders.

149
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,718
What if Inaishingi of Ago orders Karat,

150
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,596
the child of Momo,

151
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,015
instead of asking for a favor?

152
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,727
What will you do?

153
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,314
We all treated you respectfully,

154
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,192
but you kept insulting us.

155
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,153
Why?

156
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,030
Is there an ulterior motive?

157
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,787
Motive? What ulterior motive?

158
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,914
It's just

159
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,083
that you guys are worthless.

160
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,170
It's nothing.

161
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,005
He can do that.

162
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,548
He's naturally rude.

163
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,259
You can hold it in, Tachukan.

164
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,225
What? Say that again!

165
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,312
Inaishingi, don't put up
with his insults anymore!

166
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,982
Inaishingi gave you an order. Take out
the meteorite from the Lake of Stars!

167
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,280
The only person
that can give me an order

168
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,658
is someone who repays big

169
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,576
and shines brightly.

170
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,664
My Xabara, my Karika.

171
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,834
Not the Inaishingi who plays dirty

172
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,380
by asking a favor first
then giving an order next.

173
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,173
What?

174
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,344
Inaishingi. Just say the word. I will
cut that fish that has hands and feet

175
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,346
into nine pieces and offer him to you!

176
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,017
I was a fool for thinking

177
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,979
we could still talk this out since we have
a relationship with your Xabara.

178
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,773
You won't walk out of here alive.

179
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,526
No. Let him go.

180
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,903
Inaishingi. If we let him walk away,

181
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,822
the Ago Union
will become a laughing stock.

182
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,742
We'll be ridiculed even more
if we kill the guests we invited.

183
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,494
But...

184
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,381
Right.

185
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,968
It's been a while

186
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,470
since I spoke of someone's future.

187
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,431
My future?

188
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,058
Before the sun sets today,

189
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,602
you'll kneel before me.

190
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,628
NOTSAN RIVER

191
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,302
Do you feel bad about Inaishingi?

192
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,930
It won't be easy to defeat Arthdal anyway,

193
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,933
so there's nothing to feel bad about.

194
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:53,063
Actually, he almost had me
if it weren't for that galma.

195
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,317
I wondered how he unified the Ago Tribe,

196
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,360
- but now I understand.
- Why?

197
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,695
HAE KKADAK'S SON

198
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,239
Even though he was insulted that much...

199
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,365
Did you insult him?

200
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,075
A lot.

201
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,285
But he held it in.

202
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,831
Everyone can hold it in
when they're weak, unless they're idiots.

203
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,585
But holding it in
when you have such great power

204
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,421
is not easy. He was amazing.

205
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,549
He gave up without attachments.

206
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,177
Not a single one.

207
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,971
He didn't give up.

208
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,689
- What is it?
- Karat of the Momo Tribe.

209
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,067
He stays low when he knows the high place.

210
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,528
He protects darkness
when he knows brightness.

211
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,072
He swallows humiliation
when he knows honor.

212
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,283
Meet Inaishingi,
the reincarnation of the Great Ago.

213
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,245
Is he coming? Does he want to kill me

214
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,373
because he can't hold it in anymore?

215
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,686
I may be a beogeumbari,
but I'm the Xabara's kin.

216
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,312
HALF-BROTHER

217
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,605
I'm in the Xabara's galma.

218
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,984
If you kill me,
the Xabara will be entangled in galma.

219
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,570
If the Xabara gets entangled,

220
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,031
so will the entire Momo Tribe.

221
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,909
You'll be battling against
Arthdal from the front

222
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,704
and get revenge of the Momo Tribe
from behind.

223
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,831
Are you confident?

224
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,088
Is this funny?

225
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,800
You're doomed now.

226
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,803
Karat, the son and brother of Momo.

227
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,349
In the name of Xabara Karika
who repays big and shines brightly,

228
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,226
Inaishingi of the Ago Tribe...

229
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,568
requests repayment.

230
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,613
This might not be much,

231
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,865
but it's a gift from our tribe.

232
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,705
This is a token that proves he did someone
from the Momo Tribe a favor, right?

233
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,290
If you're from the Momo Tribe,

234
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,542
you must repay the favor
to whoever has this.

235
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,170
- Am I wrong?
- How do you...

236
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,423
have this?

237
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,134
Remember these words.

238
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,971
All the water is connected.

239
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,017
All the water is connected.

240
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,854
All the water is connected.

241
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,864
All the water in the world is our home.

242
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:57,081
Karat, child of Momo.
I'll repay you however you wish.

243
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,474
Thank you, Sateunik.

244
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,268
EUNSEOM'S DEAD FRIEND
FROM THE MOMO TRIBE

245
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,717
They reached it. They must've reached it.

246
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,304
- Pull.

247
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,112
- Do your best.
- Pull.

248
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,344
I, General Saya, have returned
upon your summon.

249
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,867
I've waited for you.

250
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,995
Everyone, look.

251
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,457
I've prepared something for the general.

252
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,305
Who is he?

253
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,390
He is Chobal.

254
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,894
The minister of the bang of Prisons?

255
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,273
What did he do to be sentenced
to Daeyok Punishment?

256
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,654
He called dreams dreamt by Igutus
dirty gwitgeot.

257
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,825
He wouldn't acknowledge
our sacred purple blood

258
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,744
given to us by Airuju.

259
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,454
You said this, right?

260
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,083
You told me to kill everyone.

261
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,581
You were alive, Saya.

262
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,377
I should've embraced you from the start.

263
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,630
I should've trusted you
and listened to you.

264
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,177
As you said,

265
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,180
I just had to kill everyone
who looked down on Igutus

266
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,223
and become someone frightening.

267
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,769
I had to walk on eggshells around them

268
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,564
and was always worried and anxious.

269
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,692
I'm tired. I'm exhausted.

270
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,076
But now, it's clear.

271
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,581
I got to know my mission.

272
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,544
On the day the sword
in the zelkova tree was revealed,

273
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,672
Airuju himself told me,

274
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:06,468
his son and Aramun,

275
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,056
to kill everyone
who resists the divine blood.

276
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,184
Did you hear the rumor too?

277
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,186
That I've gone crazy?

278
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,522
No.

279
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,148
I'm not crazy.

280
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,026
I'm just pretending to be crazy
because I need to.

281
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,238
Because I need to sort out those
who look down on Igutus!

282
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,959
Father.

283
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,546
Sanung Niruha.

284
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,349
Your Majesty.

285
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,354
Why?

286
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,606
Are you surprised?

287
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,817
You can't tell, can you?

288
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,902
It's confusing, right?

289
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,239
Am I really crazy

290
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,576
or am I pretending to be crazy?

291
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,831
He's a minister of the country.

292
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,000
How could he kill him so easily?

293
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,294
Also, is the Hopi Tribe
going to sit still?

294
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,046
His madness
is getting out of hand.

295
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,299
He said the general was dead
when he was alive,

296
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,093
and confined the queen for it.

297
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,430
Yes.

298
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,309
We don't know who might fall victim next.

299
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,397
Then what will happen to the queen now?

300
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,571
The king gave an order
to release the queen.

301
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,962
Did you meet the king?

302
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,048
Yes.

303
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,092
He looked a lot more unstable
than I thought.

304
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,430
Others are feeling the instability too.

305
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,557
Everyone was uneasy.

306
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,309
We must not miss this timing.

307
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,978
Of course.

308
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,233
Three things.

309
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,028
First, the troops we can use.

310
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,992
Commander Sodang
and Deputy Commander Daesayi came with me.

311
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,662
The First Corps will follow Sodang.

312
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,163
One corps isn't enough.

313
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:43,833
Approach Captain Pyeonmi.
He is not happy with the Royal Guard Head.

314
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,418
I am planning to.

315
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,880
Second.

316
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,509
Yeonbal, Gitoha, and the Third Corps.

317
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,346
Those two will never join our side.

318
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,933
Well, I'll try anyway.

319
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,769
The Third Corps is near Arthdal.

320
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,646
What will you do with them?

321
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,939
I'm thinking about it.

322
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,776
And third and last is...

323
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,403
It must be Tanya.

324
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,324
Don't worry.

325
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,785
I'll make her join our side.

326
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,953
Of course you should.

327
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,831
That will become our justification.

328
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,959
But she's not the same Tanya as before.

329
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,254
The declaration of Igutus as sacred,
and the movement of people that day.

330
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,257
Something moved orderly
in the midst of people.

331
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,842
Tanya must have

332
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,845
an organization that we do not know of.

333
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,600
Keep this in mind.
We must be in full control of Tanya.

334
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,023
I don't know when it will be.

335
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,360
It might be as soon as tomorrow,
or we might have to wait.

336
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,238
Then I'll tell
the White Peak Mountain's Hearts to--

337
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,323
No.

338
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,784
The White Peak Mountain's Hearts,
the Whisper Organization,

339
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:04,623
and Doti's people
will not be involved this time.

340
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,916
Only the priests and I will be.

341
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,837
Even if everyone works together,
we can't guarantee success. Why...

342
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,089
I'm telling you this today

343
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,886
to let everyone know not to do anything
and wait with their lives intact,

344
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,971
even if I get involved...

345
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,932
in something serious.

346
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,061
I will, Niruha.

347
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,322
What? What did you say?

348
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,366
Six months to make iron swords?

349
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,786
I will break that up, of course,

350
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,538
but do you have a kiln
that can melt a meteorite that big?

351
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,501
- We don't.
- What about big bellows?

352
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,002
A TOOL USED TO MELT IRON

353
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,421
What about bachis
who can understand my orders?

354
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,673
A CRAFTSMAN OR ENGINEER

355
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,092
I need to make
and teach everything from scratch.

356
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,470
But we cannot postpone the battle
for six months.

357
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,598
We can't go to battle
with broken bronze weapons either.

358
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,311
Big bellows, a huge kiln,

359
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,438
and bachis who can work.

360
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,608
If you have all of these,
how long will it take?

361
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,571
Well, if that meteorite breaks easily...

362
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,908
it will take about a dalpo.

363
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,202
A LITTLE OVER A MONTH

364
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,084
About a dalpo...

365
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,013
SUHANA

366
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,737
Have you found a way again?

367
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,156
It must be written on my face.

368
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,533
Yes, Inaishingi.

369
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,162
It says, "I found the answer."

370
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,540
What is it?

371
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,127
Right. How many saws and axes do we have?

372
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,255
Saws and axes?

373
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,674
What do you need them for?

374
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,927
We need to chop down a lot of logs.

375
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:27,849
Logs for making iron swords?
I'm getting even more curious.

376
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,980
What are you planning to do with the logs?

377
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,362
The knife looked like this.

378
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,039
Catapults.

379
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,416
Catapults... I see.

380
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,669
The place with bellows, kilns, and bachis.

381
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,922
Are you going to seize Molabeol Castle?

382
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,550
But Molabeol Castle is sturdy.

383
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,845
I don't know how remarkable of a catapult
Hae Kkadak can make,

384
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,889
- but it won't be easy.
- No.

385
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,016
Not Molabeol Castle.

386
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,976
We'll attack Mobon Castle.

387
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,646
If we attack using catapults

388
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,689
from the west hill of Mobon Castle,

389
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,442
we'll be able to bring down the walls.

390
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,694
But even if we attack Mobon Castle,

391
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,697
there are no kilns nor bellows there.

392
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,868
That's the place where all supplies
from Arthdal to Molabeol pass.

393
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:32,872
That is, the place where a large number
of iron swords made in Arthdal will pass.

394
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,916
Ah, I see.

395
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,754
If we take over Mobon Castle,
we can seize their weapons.

396
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:44,926
Yes. So please prepare
the necessary things in secret.

397
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,595
I will, Inaishingi.

398
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,942
Why Mobon Castle all of a sudden?

399
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,696
How do you know if iron swords
will be brought by carts or troops?

400
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:26,050
It's light,
but it's no different from a bronze sword.

401
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,512
I'll increase the purity of iron
and make one again.

402
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,182
I wish Hae Kkadak was here.

403
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,769
Please try harder.

404
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,688
I will, Your Highness.

405
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,442
Your Highness.

406
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,653
Are you really going to do it?

407
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,741
Can you really kill someone
whom you've wished for...

408
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,785
for so long?

409
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,710
He was someone...

410
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,130
I wished for in the past.

411
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,593
Then shall I send a message to
the warriors of the White Mountain Tribe?

412
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,262
No.

413
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,807
After our work is done,
and Saya and I take over Arthdal,

414
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,478
they will do the most important job.

415
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,901
Drink up.

416
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,569
Let's eat and drink.

417
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,987
Thank you.

418
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,324
Let's have a drink. Drink up.

419
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,700
You did well.

420
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,330
ROYAL GUARD BAKRYANGPUNG

421
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,583
COMMANDER SODANG

422
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,960
Did the king lose his mind?

423
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,171
The Ago Tribe was right in front of us,
but he changed the general

424
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,090
- because of a fake general?
That's not all.

425
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,216
COMMANDER GITOHA

426
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:52,387
He killed a minister over a trivial matter
and captured innocent kids.

427
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,555
How did he change so much?

428
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,723
COMMANDER YEONBAL

429
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,101
I'm so frustrated!

430
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,229
Will you just stay frustrated?
Must we sit still and watch?

431
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,273
That's right.
We can't just sit and do nothing.

432
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,485
If the king takes the wrong path,
we should correct him.

433
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,072
Stop drinking.

434
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,117
We have to do something, Yeonbal.

435
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:20,957
But you know,
I think we shouldn't harass the king...

436
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:24,085
No, we shouldn't harass Tagon,
the leader of the Daekan Force.

437
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,087
AN ELITE FORCE
LED BY TAGON IN THE PAST

438
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,215
I can see him struggling in pain
despite his recent behaviors.

439
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,552
I'm not saying we should harass him.
A minister received Daeyok Punishment.

440
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,013
You don't know when it might be our turn.

441
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,724
Hey, where are you going?

442
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,700
To see Mubaek.

443
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,039
I miss him so much today.

444
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,209
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

445
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,713
Guys.

446
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:13,134
Please understand.
He's very upset nowadays.

447
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,304
Hey, wait for me!

448
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,268
It won't work.

449
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,063
Those two are Daekan down to their bones.

450
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,482
They won't betray the king.

451
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,901
If both Yeonbal and Gitoha
become our enemies,

452
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,985
it won't be easy.

453
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,866
If we have to fight them...

454
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,160
we must.

455
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,707
A rebellion?

456
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,794
What about Nunbyeol?

457
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,504
She might do

458
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:53,299
what is most important
and what she wished for the most.

459
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,843
A weapon we hid just in case.

460
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,888
She's something like that.

461
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,140
Can she get out safely?

462
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,064
She's the strongest creature
in the world.

463
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,566
Must I even help her with that?

464
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:15,321
Even the strongest creature in the world
bleeds when stabbed and dies when killed.

465
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,284
Where are you going?

466
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,245
Tell me in detail. What's your plan?

467
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,790
I'm a little busy tonight.

468
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,959
I need to meet someone important.

469
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,585
Who?

470
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,675
Someone who got his ear cut off by Tagon
instead of his head.

471
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,097
Are you just going to watch?

472
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,974
What do you mean?

473
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,435
You must have seen and heard things.

474
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,604
About King Tagon.

475
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:53,359
I'm worried too, so I would like to
give him some advice.

476
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,486
Two people gave the king advice.

477
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,489
One got his head cut off
and another got his ear cut off.

478
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:03,161
Which part of you
do you think will get cut off?

479
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,207
You're going too far.

480
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,501
I'll go even further.

481
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,922
Someone who can rule Arthdal well
must become the king.

482
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,258
Minister.

483
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,427
Do you realize what you're saying?

484
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,761
Of course.

485
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:25,808
If you report me to the king tomorrow,
I'll be beheaded.

486
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,978
Yes, I know. Of course I know.

487
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:34,233
I, Chojaha,
am risking my life to say this.

488
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,449
I am exiling the Hopi Tribe from Arthdal.

489
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,160
Airuju told me

490
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,247
that the Hopi Tribe is holding a grudge
against me regarding Chobal's punishment,

491
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,874
so exile them all.

492
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,711
Slaughter everyone that resists the exile.

493
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,643
Your Majesty.

494
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,521
Minister Chobal received Daeyok Punishment
befitting of his crime

495
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,190
and fell to darkness.

496
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,360
But if you take in

497
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:22,615
the Hopi Tribe of Chobal
and take care of them...

498
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:26,202
Is this the place
to talk about something so foolish?

499
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,875
Your Majesty.

500
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,003
I, Yeonbal,
the commander of the Third Corps

501
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:40,341
put my life on the line to advise you.

502
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:54,313
Please release the young people born
in the year of the singing wolf.

503
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,816
Please take back your order
on the Hopi Tribe.

504
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,820
Please send the general and me
to the frontline.

505
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,905
If you do not agree,

506
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,992
I will end my life here.

507
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,614
How foolish and pitiful.

508
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,742
Please do as I say.

509
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,495
Come back to how you were before.

510
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,748
Come back to being my king.

511
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,875
You cannot keep going like this.

512
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,678
Commander Yeonbal

513
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,264
insulted Aramun Haesulla's judgement.

514
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,768
- Yeonbal--
Stop now!

515
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,987
What is this?

516
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,781
Is this why you became a king?

517
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,657
An insult?

518
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,453
You are insulting Yeonbal's sincerity now.

519
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,081
How did you become like this?

520
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,083
My King...

521
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,213
Where is my Tagon?

522
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:51,097
For insulting this sacred place,
I sentence Yeonbal and Gitoha...

523
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,518
to Daeyok Punishment.

524
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,915
THE GREAT GOCHIJU ROCK

525
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,126
When they attacked Remus...

526
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,210
HOMETOWN OF HAE TRIBE

527
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,546
...my grandfather drank mahasin
and escaped.

528
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,172
ONE OF THE HAE TRIBE'S THREE POISONS

529
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:28,843
If he didn't,
how many things would have changed?

530
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,595
Both you and I,

531
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,598
and even the history of Arthdal.

532
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,559
Isn't mahasin just a legend?

533
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,144
Does it...

534
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,396
really exist?

535
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,568
Will Tagon really kill Yeonbal and Gitoha?

536
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,740
Tagon cannot stop now.

537
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,910
He cannot trust anyone,
and he will become more and more lonely.

538
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:57,997
He'll self-destruct.

539
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,584
You're right.

540
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:07,423
There's so few people he trusts
that Gilseon went to exile the Hopi Tribe.

541
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,884
The Royal Guards...

542
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,969
The big problem was solved unexpectedly.

543
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:18,267
If Yeonbal and Gitoha really die,
the Third Corps might join our side too.

544
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,233
Don't tell me

545
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,987
that you're wavering now.

546
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:32,948
No way.

547
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:34,909
It's just that...

548
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,078
I feel sad.

549
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,706
I might end up crying.

550
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,583
Just like...

551
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,754
when I killed Father.

552
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,053
Let's do it on the night...

553
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,223
Gilseon goes to war.

554
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,902
Who are you? Constructing outside
the North Gate without my permission!

555
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,779
That is, well...

556
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,822
I was ordered to change the waterway

557
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,991
when the inside
of the North Gate sank down

558
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,826
because of the heavy rains last time.

559
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,703
- Who gave you the permission?
- Right.

560
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,123
Well, the previous general did.

561
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,208
Here.

562
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,712
- Stop it right now.
- Pardon?

563
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,798
How can you do this
when Ago is right up front?

564
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,133
Hold on.

565
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,262
Goodness.

566
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,931
How can you do this?

567
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,183
You should pay me.

568
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,518
Come on!

569
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,353
Darn it.

570
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,068
I was so scared that he might tell me
to continue the construction.

571
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,821
I'm done now, right?

572
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,657
Your mission is accomplished.

573
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:00,244
Go back and wait in Doldambul
until the next order.

574
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,162
Oh...

575
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,873
Goodness.

576
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,303
We'll attack Molabeol Castle immediately.

577
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,727
Molabeol Castle, not Mobon Castle?

578
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,729
- But--
- Badoru

579
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,606
already finished all the preparations

580
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,608
and is waiting for us on Mana Hill.

581
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,318
We will advance

582
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,946
to Molabeol Castle quickly

583
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,950
- and carefully.
Yes, Inaishingi.

584
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,006
MOLABEOL CASTLE

585
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,884
- What's that noise?
- I think it's coming from up there,

586
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,968
but I can't see anything.

587
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,053
COMMANDER DUPA

588
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,096
I think it's the Ago Tribe.

589
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,932
They said they would attack Mobon Castle.

590
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,269
I think there's something
over there.

591
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,278
What is that?
I'm not sure.

592
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,906
I think it's a rock.

593
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,045
Gosh.

594
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,922
I wondered
where all the horses went.

595
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,382
How did this...

596
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,093
- Good job.
- Hey!

597
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,969
Just get ready.

598
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,096
Right.

599
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,932
From now on, it's my turn.

600
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,810
That punk, Syoreujagin, did his job well.

601
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,397
So that's the weakest spot.

602
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,110
- Start.
- Yes, Inaishingi.

603
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,696
Grab the rope!

604
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,780
Yes, sir!

605
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,079
They're going to roll that rock
to break the wall?

606
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,708
But Molabeol Castle
won't collapse with a single rock.

607
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,005
Pull!

608
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,658
That's not a rock.

609
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,164
No!

610
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,389
All forces, charge!

611
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,590
Open it.

612
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,710
If you stand in front of everyone,

613
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,463
repent for your sins,
and swear your loyalty to me,

614
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,382
I will only cut off your feet.

615
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,427
I already said

616
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:29,429
I would die

617
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,890
if you didn't listen to me.

618
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:32,975
Yeonbal.

619
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,353
You?

620
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,063
If I continue to live

621
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,399
after Yeonbal dies, with my feet cut off,

622
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,192
crawling on all fours,

623
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,778
wouldn't that life be worse than death?

624
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,114
There is no other way.

625
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,950
Then die.

626
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,588
Execute Yeonbal and Gitoha
with Daeyok Punishment.

627
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,166
Throw their heads into Gitgang.

628
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,460
Their corpses

629
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,880
will be hung here
for seven days and nights.

630
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,257
Whoever touches their corpses

631
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,969
will also be guilty of treason
and be executed the same way.

632
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,965
Just go. Don't get caught up in this too.

633
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,813
Yes, Niruha.

634
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,537
Niruha.

635
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,706
Niruha.

636
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,250
We lost Commanders Yeonbal and Gitoha

637
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,544
to Daeyok Punishment.

638
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:09,131
They were beheaded
so they will surely become gosals.

639
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,298
REVENGEFUL SPIRIT

640
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,842
Please comfort their souls

641
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,136
and send them to Airuju.

642
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,105
Do you understand
what it means to tell me this?

643
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,774
Yes. If you perform an ollimsani
for those guilty of treason...

644
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,526
A RITUAL PERFORMED
TO GUIDE A SOUL TO GOD

645
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,237
- you will be guilty of treason too.
- So why?

646
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,156
You'll get the Third Corps on your side.

647
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,534
Yangcha.

648
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,746
Yangcha, the son of Saenyeok
and the bodyguard of the High Priest.

649
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,749
As the only person
who knows Niruha's big secret,

650
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:47,335
I will bury that secret in my heart
and join your side.

651
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,757
Yes.

652
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,217
Yes, you will.

653
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,084
The High Priest is with us too,
which gives us a lot of support.

654
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:30,378
General, all there's left
is taking action.

655
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,382
The Third Corps is moving
to Arthdal already.

656
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,718
Yes. As long as
the Third Corps joins our side...

657
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,011
You did a great job.

658
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,097
It was nothing.

659
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,723
I told them that the High Priest

660
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:44,309
would perform
an ollimsani for Yeonbal, Gitoha,

661
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,645
and those
who were killed unfairly by the king,

662
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,313
and the soldiers of the Third Corps

663
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,649
cried out in frustration
and decided to join us.

664
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:54,820
Tomorrow, Gilseon and the Royal Guards
will leave to subjugate the Hopi Tribe.

665
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,238
Airuju helped us.

666
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,951
Tomorrow night,
Arthdal's history will change,

667
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,620
and divine power and glory
will be put upright again.

668
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,581
We won't meet each other
until we carry out the plan.

669
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:10,335
We will see each other again
in the reception room of the palace.

670
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,257
Good luck, everyone.

671
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,800
Under the name of Airuju.

672
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,344
Under the name of Airuju.

673
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,942
We'll attack the palace
when the Royal Guards change the shifts.

674
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:37,154
Send me a message
as soon as you take over the military.

675
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,530
I will.

676
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:42,367
See you again at this time tomorrow night.
In front of Tagon's corpse.

677
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,161
Alive.

678
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,163
Of course.

679
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,218
Nunbyeol.

680
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,389
Chaeeun.

681
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,444
I heard from Saya.

682
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,237
You remember, right?

683
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,989
To use as much strength as possible--

684
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,408
I know. Control my breath
for more than seven minutes.

685
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,371
I practiced it multiple times
in front of Tagon, so I'm used to it.

686
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,041
If things don't work out, run.

687
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,251
You'll get another chance.

688
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,880
Never, under any circumstances,

689
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,175
try to exchange your life with Tagon's.

690
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,596
Promise me.

691
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,057
Don't worry, Chaeeun.

692
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,945
At times like this,
he looks like a caring father.

693
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,697
I really don't understand. How...

694
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,869
Yes, I won.

695
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,414
You won, Arok.

696
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,512
When you're with Arok,

697
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,014
you seem like a different person.

698
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,521
You'll become a good father.

699
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,773
You'll be nothing like Sanung.

700
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,776
I definitely will.

701
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,653
No matter what.

702
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:46,199
Don't you want to apologize to me?

703
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,746
Would that mean anything to us now?

704
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,543
Even if it doesn't...

705
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,047
I want to hear it.

706
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:07,971
I'm sorry.

707
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,140
But in the future,

708
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,018
I might do more things I'll be sorry for.

709
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,687
I'm sorry too.

710
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,690
I could've treated you better.

711
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,026
But I, too,

712
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:24,654
might do more things I'll be sorry for.

713
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,823
You ruined it all, Taealha.

714
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,533
No, it wasn't me.

715
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,826
Then was it me?

716
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:33,580
We just misunderstood
ourselves and each other.

717
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,498
What did I misunderstand?

718
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,417
And what did you misunderstand?

719
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,461
I trusted you.

720
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,546
I've always trusted you.

721
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,924
Many times, I risked my life for you...

722
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,219
without caring for my life.

723
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,304
Maybe...

724
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,266
I could continue to do the same.

725
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,728
- But?
- But, Tagon,

726
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,856
I can give up my life for you,

727
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:03,401
but I cannot be a part of you,
no matter how hard I try.

728
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,238
I realize it now.

729
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,993
You fool.

730
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,705
If that was what you wanted...

731
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,045
you shouldn't have made me a king.

732
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,218
You're right.

733
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,347
I shouldn't have.

734
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,451
This many people died in that short while?

735
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:57,080
Yeonbal, Gitoha, Minister Chobal,

736
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,916
those born in the year of the singing wolf

737
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,459
that resisted and got killed,

738
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,421
and three yakbachis who attended to Tagon.

739
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,005
DOCTOR

740
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,342
Please help us.

741
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,892
After the ritual, the priests
and I will go out with manjangs.

742
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,979
FLAGS WITH EULOGIES
WRITTEN ON THEM

743
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,480
I understand.

744
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,066
People will gather,

745
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,318
and you can make an announcement there.

746
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,696
If things go wrong,

747
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,281
go to Eunseom.

748
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,033
I prepared a boat at Gitgang.

749
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,577
A RIVER ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ARTHDAL

750
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,747
Thank you.

751
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,168
You think about me,

752
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,920
take care of me, and worry about me.

753
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,882
Thank you for everything.

754
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,010
I never told you this.

755
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,761
You saying that makes it feel like

756
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,014
we're going to fail.

757
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,434
As if we're seeing each other
for the last time.

758
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,937
We will succeed.

759
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,274
So I don't need the boat.

760
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,610
I won't go to Eunseom.

761
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,696
Let's succeed, open the gates,

762
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,657
and welcome Eunseom.

763
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,480
I want to be alone for a while.

764
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,066
Your Highness.

765
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:01,371
You must survive under any circumstances,

766
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,165
just like your grandfather did.

767
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,293
I will.

768
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:10,880
I will survive

769
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,758
under any circumstances.

770
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,939
Quiet.

771
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,243
The shoulder plate is torn. Repair it.

772
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,754
Why are you here, Commander?

773
01:01:56,754 --> 01:02:00,675
Why? Don't you know
what happened in Arthdal?

774
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:06,347
- My brothers, Gitoha and Yeonbal, died.
Commander Sodang.

775
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:10,268
- What are you saying?
- The king is crazy.

776
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,352
What?

777
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,243
Lower the corpses.

778
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,663
Pardon? What are you saying, General?

779
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:34,417
Commanders Yeonbal and Gitoha
are heroes of Arthdal

780
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,252
who were killed unfairly by King Tagon.

781
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,007
We cannot humiliate
their bodies like that.

782
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,805
Was there anything I said

783
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,058
- that was wrong?
- General.

784
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:52,894
Disobeying the king's order...

785
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:55,688
is treason.

786
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,915
The king is possessed by a gosal.

787
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,501
His eyes are blurred
and his mind is confused,

788
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,212
so the sacred spirit
of Aramun has already left the king.

789
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,256
His evil grew
and brought upon a catastrophe.

790
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,841
I, General Saya,

791
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,052
will slay that evil.

792
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,221
Daesayi!

793
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,198
Let's go to the military.

794
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:11,889
What did you...

795
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,057
Open it.

796
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,361
Stop!

797
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,113
Daesayi.

798
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:11,699
Attack!

799
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,242
Attack!

800
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,465
When I hum like this,

801
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,176
he falls asleep rather well.

802
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,387
You are a good father.

803
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:21,143
What was your father like?

804
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,648
He was a nice father.

805
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:29,568
He held me in his embrace
to put me to bed,

806
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,487
and told me stories of the past.

807
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,699
But how did he pass away?

808
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:56,137
General. The entire Third Corps
has arrived in front of the North Gate.

809
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:58,431
Let's go and welcome them.

810
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,474
- Yes. Let's go.
Okay.

811
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,610
Your father died so unfairly.

812
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,697
You must've felt very hurt.

813
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,116
How did you endure it?

814
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:19,535
I'll get revenge.

815
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:22,830
I'll crush him no matter what.

816
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,709
I made a resolution every day
and endured it.

817
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,921
Yes, revenge.

818
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,509
Revenge.

819
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:41,891
Quiet.

820
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,540
When Tagon hums a song like this,

821
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,042
tell me immediately.

822
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,710
It means he's scheming something.

823
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,268
But...

824
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,230
do you think...

825
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:31,941
you can get revenge?

826
01:08:57,925 --> 01:08:59,051
Open the gates.

827
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:35,045
Welcome!

828
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:36,964
Brothers of the Third Corps!

829
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,706
Some of them...

830
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,084
are not dead.

831
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:01,632
Why are you here?

832
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:03,884
Run away. It's a trap.

833
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,428
He fooled everyone.

834
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,430
What?

835
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:11,350
What is she saying?

836
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,348
Cut me.

837
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:54,101
There are so many ministers
and Vice-ministers,

838
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:57,646
but are you really the only one
who truly cares for me?

839
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,698
Would you like to listen to my plan?

840
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:25,549
Everyone, scatter.

841
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:28,052
Go back to your posts immediately.

842
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,262
Niruha, why...

843
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:31,555
Yangcha.

844
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:33,432
I think we were tricked.

845
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:39,813
I said, run!

846
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:07,257
Forgive me for testing you.

847
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,053
I will find and execute
the traitors of Arthdal,

848
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,972
and set divine power and glory upright.

849
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:16,517
Would you like to join me?

850
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:20,562
All soldiers, charge!

851
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,773
Kill the traitors!

852
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,336
Why did I make you

853
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,423
repair my armor
in the middle of the night,

854
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:49,341
and why am I wearing it now?

855
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:53,178
Because tonight is the night of war.

856
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:55,597
When you tended to my wound,

857
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:58,642
I noticed right away
that your hands were that of a swordsman.

858
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:00,561
When you came into this room,

859
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:02,646
I knew you hid your knife in your dress.

860
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:05,691
Take it out.

861
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,244
Even three Black Tongues of Shahati
couldn't kill me.

862
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:22,666
But did you think you could kill me
with that knife alone?

863
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,919
Do you think someone like you
could even hurt me?

864
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:34,720
Saya and Taealha's plan is pathetic.

865
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,557
Did you do that on purpose?

866
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,142
Everything.

867
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:44,646
With the big war with Ago
around the corner,

868
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,858
I had no way of filtering out traitors.

869
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:53,113
You told me

870
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:55,991
that there wasn't a way to distinguish

871
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:59,369
between friends and foes
unless their lives were at stake.

872
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:03,207
Your plan failed completely.

873
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,709
How unfortunate.

874
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:12,424
Do you think
you saw through everything tonight?

875
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,636
Did I miss anything?

876
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:17,429
One thing.

877
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,312
What is it?

878
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:28,774
Who I am.

879
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,277
Harim's daughter.

880
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,488
Do you think I didn't know that?

881
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,240
Yes.

882
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:39,493
I am Harim's daughter.

883
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:42,162
And...

884
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:46,708
what you missed tonight is...

885
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,408
I'm the strongest creature

886
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:22,160
in the world.

887
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:48,061
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

888
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:06,705
Aramun is Asa Sin's messenger.

889
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:09,541
The moment you kill me, you're not Aramun.

890
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,460
There's only one way
for you to live.

891
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,337
Kill Tanya.

892
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:15,714
If you thought
that was difficult for me,

893
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:17,883
you really don't know me.

894
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:19,926
It's beyond my power now.

895
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:21,261
Only you can save Niruha.

896
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,723
The real one is coming.
The real Aramun.

897
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:27,517
This is a forest and a mountain.

898
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:30,145
They are always on the Ago Tribe's side.

899
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:32,606
Tagon is here.

900
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:34,566
It is a godsent opportunity.
