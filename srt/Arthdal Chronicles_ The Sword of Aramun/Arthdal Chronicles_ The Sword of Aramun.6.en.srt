1
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:49,966
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

2
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,552
Aramun's purple blood
has been passed on to them.

3
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:57,849
I announce that the Aramun dynasty,
the first dynasty of Arthdal, has begun.

4
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,976
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

5
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,644
- Please!
- Tagon, what's wrong? Look at me.

6
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,233
We must kill everyone
who has seen our blood.

7
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,611
-   Igutus are not--
- Everyone is pretending...

8
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,945
in front of us.

9
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,614
We must not trust anyone.

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,326
Run.

11
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,706
It is passed down in the family of Ragaz.

12
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,794
Thank you.
I mean it wholeheartedly.

13
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,134
Who are you?

14
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,763
It will change
once she finds out that he is Inaishingi.

15
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,393
How long will you...

16
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,520
Eunseom.

17
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,065
What is this?
An iron sword.

18
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,526
Thousands and millions
of Arthdal's soldiers

19
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,569
will be armed with iron swords now.

20
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,822
You lot can never win this war.

21
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,991
I hope you will save
many lives of the Ago Tribe

22
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,493
who will die in vain.

23
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,830
You put Tanya Niruha
in too much danger.

24
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,623
Die here, Inaishingi.

25
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,380
"When the zelkova tree cracks
and my sword is revealed,

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,006
Aramun will know his mission."

27
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,509
I hope you realize that you're Aramun.

28
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:27,730
FAKE INAISHINGI

29
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,860
Go and tell the High Priest two things.

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,363
That is the price of your life.

31
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,621
Aramun's sword was found
in the zelkova tree.

32
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,290
What nonsense is that?

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,168
There's nothing inside.

34
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,795
No.

35
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,884
From now on, this is Aramun's sword.

36
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,767
No matter how you see it,

37
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,020
this sword is mine.

38
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,607
Tell her!

39
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,318
I, Eunseom of the Wahan Tribe,

40
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,071
will become Inaishingi

41
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,658
and Aramun Haesulla!

42
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,902
They saw my blood.

43
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,321
Tagon, did you do this?

44
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,822
What happened? I...

45
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,116
Why am I like this?

46
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,160
- Tagon.
- Tell me, Taealha.

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,245
What happened?

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,624
You got hurt while trying
to save Arok in Ttesarichon.

49
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,251
Why are you doing this?

50
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,589
That wasn't...

51
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,592
a dream?

52
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,653
It was worth not giving up.

53
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,115
The waterfall helped us.

54
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,200
Thank you.

55
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,369
But who are those people?

56
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,746
I'm sure he will explain later.

57
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,708
What are you doing?

58
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,960
What are you going to do?

59
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,545
Then,

60
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,840
should I reveal who I am?

61
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,092
Let's just follow them.

62
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,847
Get a hold of yourself, Tagon.

63
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,682
This is not a dream.

64
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,642
This is not

65
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,229
- a dream?
- What happened in Ttesarichon,

66
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,064
your purple blood being revealed,

67
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,025
and Tanya acknowledging the sacredness

68
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,693
of Igutus wasn't a dream, Tagon.

69
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,407
Tagon.

70
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,868
I understand.

71
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,747
You paid a very high price
to hide it for your entire life.

72
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,749
Yes.

73
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,084
It might be hard to accept it.

74
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,546
But Tagon, what is important now is

75
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,632
that you have to take all of these.

76
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,510
Not Tanya. You.

77
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,056
You must take them all
as if they were yours to begin with.

78
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,850
Is there someone

79
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,852
over there?

80
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,275
Tagon.

81
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,820
Is no one there?

82
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,239
There is no one.

83
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,116
Who are you seeing?

84
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,705
My father.

85
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,667
Sanung died more than 10 years ago.

86
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,753
You killed him. Don't you remember?

87
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,842
We used every medicine we could.

88
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,763
He might see or hear things for a while,

89
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,473
but he will recover.

90
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,945
Tagon.

91
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,032
Do you see your father over there?

92
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,790
Yes.

93
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,875
He is looking at me.

94
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,753
That can happen.

95
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,880
You were injured badly.

96
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,299
You took too much medicine
to help you sleep

97
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,718
and you are exhausted.

98
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,180
But, Tagon...

99
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,683
it's fake.

100
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,438
It's neither a spirit
nor a gosal. It's just fake.

101
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,564
VENGEFUL SPIRIT, GHOST

102
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,401
It's just an illusion, Tagon.

103
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,743
Do not look at what is fake.

104
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,662
I'm real.

105
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,581
I'm Taealha.

106
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,088
You gave up your whole life
for our son Arok.

107
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,677
And we fought together and saved him.

108
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,808
That's how we earned this chance
and it is a blessing.

109
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,863
It is our world now, Tagon.

110
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,047
The queen has arrived.

111
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,720
- Your Highness.
- What medicine did you use on Tagon?

112
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,473
Hazelnut roots, mistletoe,

113
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,141
and fly agaric--

114
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,309
Fly agaric?

115
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,938
- Can you use it on an Igutu?
- It is hard to tell.

116
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,731
Who would've tried using

117
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,816
such expensive medicine
on an Igutu before?

118
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,194
- What?
- But the wound was deep,

119
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,030
he was bleeding badly,
and his heart was beating too fast.

120
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,699
It would've been dangerous
if I had not stabilized him,

121
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,701
so I had no choice, Your Highness.

122
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,204
Tagon is hallucinating.

123
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,497
Will he return to normal?

124
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,581
Still?

125
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,962
I think the effect is stronger on him
because he is Igutu.

126
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,762
How is the king?

127
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,097
What about him?

128
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,515
We lost him.

129
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,725
We could not make the search obvious.

130
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,311
My Queen.

131
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,106
Our soldier saw a man
who helped him escape.

132
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,691
Find out who he is

133
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:30,528
even if you have to show the soldier
every single person in Arthdal.

134
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,779
Understood.

135
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,701
Tanya.

136
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,208
What are you praying for?

137
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,838
Please don't stand up.

138
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,052
I just cannot understand.

139
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,471
Understand what?

140
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,056
How you're acquainted with...

141
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,145
Saya's benetbeot.

142
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,357
Who knows?

143
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,235
Does that mean anything now?

144
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,041
At one point,

145
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,252
I started to hear other people's thoughts.

146
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,588
It must be
the psychic ability of the gods.

147
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:35,301
You must've been happy to have gained
such an ability naturally.

148
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,889
No. It was... extremely painful.

149
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,184
I barely managed to accept it.

150
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,312
Extremely painful?

151
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,855
Why?

152
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,317
Because I don't only hear good things.

153
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,737
Even if I cover my ears,
I can't block them out.

154
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:01,869
But I could hear some people's thoughts
and some, I could not.

155
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,915
Why is that?
I didn't know for a long time.

156
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,501
But now I do.

157
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,463
I couldn't hear the thoughts
of those who shut me out.

158
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,424
That's a relief.

159
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,135
You wouldn't have heard
my thoughts all this time.

160
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,804
No. But...

161
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,142
today, I could finally hear
your thoughts faintly.

162
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,770
Maybe you need someone to lean on

163
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,022
because things are tough
and you're in distress.

164
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,526
Fine.

165
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,654
What thoughts of mine do you hear?

166
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,908
"I was impatient."

167
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,744
"I was worried
about the era of bronze passing."

168
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,706
"So I wanted to use that man
who had the same face as Saya."

169
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,166
"I just needed
the Wind and Flower Ritual to be done."

170
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,127
"As long as the heir was secured,

171
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,586
everything would've been fine."

172
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,172
"But it was ruined."

173
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,551
Are they similar?

174
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,972
Yes.

175
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,641
But we couldn't even do
the Wind and Flower Ritual,

176
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,393
and the king is delirious.

177
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,895
Saya's benetbeot has disappeared,

178
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,606
and Igutus have become sacred overnight,
thanks to you.

179
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:18,738
But I think all of these
might not be Arok's or Tagon's.

180
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,531
No matter who gives you what,

181
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,744
if you don't grab it,
it's not yours in the end.

182
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,996
You're the one who knows that the best.

183
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,208
By any chance,

184
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,128
are you thinking of another Aramun?

185
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,217
That would also belong
to whoever grabs it.

186
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,137
That is why you rose to that position.

187
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,197
That is not the only reason
why I rose to this position.

188
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,325
I, Taealha,

189
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,620
rose to this position
because I could not tolerate

190
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,414
things that I could not fathom
or make sense of for a long time.

191
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,542
I hope you keep that in mind.

192
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,669
Niruha.

193
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,424
You have shut me out again.

194
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,509
I am...

195
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,178
very glad to hear that.

196
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,363
Yangcha.

197
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,074
What happened?

198
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,261
Airuju.

199
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,396
Airuju.

200
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,111
Airuju.

201
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,739
Airuju.

202
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,366
It's the king!

203
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,704
King Tagon.

204
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,456
Protect us.

205
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,374
Airuju.

206
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,668
Your Majesty.
Please recover.

207
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,337
You Igutu bastard.

208
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,421
Kill him.

209
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,090
Igutu.

210
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,302
Go away.

211
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,348
Goodness.

212
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,602
Holy Igutu king.

213
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,775
Go away.

214
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,288
They're fake. They're all fake.

215
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,795
Do you really think

216
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,633
people consider Igutus as sacred

217
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,302
and are praising you?

218
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,305
I don't think
you're dumb enough to believe that.

219
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,140
EX-UNION LEADER OF ARTHDAL,
TAGON'S FATHER

220
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,520
I know you're an illusion.

221
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,730
You're fake.

222
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,609
Then you must know
that what I'm saying is true.

223
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,571
What is the truth?

224
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:34,785
In order to hide your blood,
you killed your childhood friends,

225
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:39,164
your mother,
and in the end, you killed me too.

226
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,834
Now, Tagon.

227
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,503
You must kill everyone now.

228
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:49,508
That is the reality you must face.

229
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,553
That is your real self
that has not changed once

230
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,598
since you were born with that dirty blood.

231
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,767
Is there anyone outside?

232
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,227
Put me to bed.

233
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,438
Bring me the sleeping medicine.

234
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,940
Make me sleep right now!

235
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,401
- Hurry up and give me the medicine!
- Go quickly.

236
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,447
You go. Three yakbachis
who brought him medicine died yesterday.

237
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,617
I will go.

238
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,702
Goodness.

239
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,372
NEANTHAL

240
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,682
To maximize your strength,

241
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,018
control your breath
for more than seven minutes.

242
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,853
Don't ever push yourself.

243
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,397
If you use it carelessly, you might die.

244
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,107
Promise me.

245
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,569
If you don't want to kill me,
you must not do anything on your own.

246
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,324
Medicine. Give me the medicine.

247
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,387
Is my blood dirty?

248
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,431
It is not.

249
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,850
Then is it sacred?

250
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,437
If I detect a lie in your answer,
I will kill you.

251
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,814
Tell me!

252
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,275
What is so great about blood

253
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,194
that some are sacred and some are not?

254
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,322
Blood is just blood

255
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,407
regardless of its color.

256
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,168
I've never heard of that before.

257
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,213
Who said that?

258
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,133
My father who treated Igutus...

259
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,929
said that when he was alive.

260
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,519
Ishillobu beresa.

261
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,770
GOD'S HONOR

262
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,481
Aramun Haesulla.

263
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,617
What?

264
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,411
Eunseom told me
to relay this message to you.

265
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,747
What are you planning to do? He is...

266
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,958
Inaishingi.

267
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,129
If King Tagon finds out,
you won't be safe. No.

268
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,507
The people of Arthdal
will not forgive you either.

269
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,012
How will they know

270
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,848
when you'll keep quiet?

271
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,065
I can tell King Tagon
everything at any time.

272
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:38,237
Haven't you fooled King Tagon
too many times to do that?

273
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,370
The same lightning scar
was marked on his arm and shoulder.

274
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,958
Eunseom said he would become Aramun.

275
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,189
Oh! It's the sword of Aramun.

276
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,482
It's the sword of Aramun.

277
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,776
- The oracle came true.

278
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,945
The sword appeared.

279
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,531
It's the sword of Aramun.
My goodness.

280
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,116
How incredible.

281
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,840
It's the sword of Aramun.

282
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,182
Niruha.

283
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,187
High Priest Niruha.

284
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,607
I do not understand.

285
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,819
Actually, many others are confused too.

286
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,154
Yes, Niruha.

287
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,282
Aramun Haesulla's tomb was found
out of the blue,

288
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,200
you announced Igutus as sacred beings,

289
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,038
and now Aramun's sword has appeared
and we are to know the mission.

290
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,373
My head is dizzy
because I cannot comprehend

291
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,666
what all of this means.

292
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,960
I am sure you are.

293
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,879
That is reasonable.

294
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,214
How is that so, Niruha?

295
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,759
Because what God gives us

296
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,470
is chaos, not an answer.

297
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,513
What does that mean?

298
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,726
Why would God give us chaos?

299
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:37,522
Airuju gives us land, but not crops.

300
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,818
Airuju gives us tailwinds, but not ships.

301
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,615
It is the farmers' job to grow crops
on the land given by God.

302
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,620
It is the sailors' job to make ships
and set sails for tailwinds given by God.

303
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,915
Therefore, it is the job
of those who believe

304
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,876
to find the answers
within the chaos given by God.

305
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,713
Let me ask you.

306
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,217
What kind of god is Aramun Haesulla,
the son of Airuju?

307
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,551
He is the god of war.

308
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,178
He is the god of victory
and unification.

309
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,721
He is the god of war.

310
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,181
He's the god of unification.

311
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:15,727
Why did the god of war and victory come
as an Igutu and as a stranger?

312
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,812
Then...

313
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,024
is there more to Airuju's will, Niruha?

314
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,610
For a long time,

315
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,029
Igutus were despised and looked down upon,

316
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,492
and all strangers
were oppressed and ostracized in Arthdal.

317
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,954
Can you see the answer in this chaos?

318
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,500
I can see.

319
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,168
I can see.
I think I understand.

320
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,255
I, the reincarnation of Asa Sin,
High Priest Asa Tanya

321
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,717
speak of Airuju's will
in the month of the wolf

322
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:51,513
of the year of the hungry snake
that the sword of Aramun appeared.

323
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,141
Ishillobu beresa.

324
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,476
Follow those

325
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,939
who have been despised the most
and have been at the lowest place.

326
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:06,111
Embrace those you rejected the most,
those you are most unfamiliar with.

327
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,991
If you do so, you will hear
Asa Sin's voice in your mind

328
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,492
when you least expect it.

329
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,661
They're the words of Asa Sin.

330
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,163
They're the words of Asa Sin.

331
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,332
They're the words of Asa Sin.

332
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,210
They're the words of Asa Sin.

333
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,549
Embrace the stranger.

334
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,135
Embrace the stranger.

335
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,013
They're the words of Asa Sin.

336
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,185
Eunseom, I've started.

337
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,271
I hope you win.

338
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,774
Inaishingi Eunseom.

339
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,152
Aramun Haesulla.

340
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,823
This is so...

341
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,243
I put in so much effort to get to Arthdal.

342
00:24:56,578 --> 00:25:00,790
Goodness, look at me.

343
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,796
Sir, I still brought this with me.

344
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,341
- Gosh, what is this?

345
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,092
Hey.

346
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,595
What about it?

347
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,514
Bronze trading rights?

348
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,975
What's the point of this scroll?

349
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,645
We made a mess in Arthdal and escaped.

350
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,688
I'm sure the queen already did something.

351
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,525
If you take this to Pyeongmire,

352
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,693
you'll get beheaded right away.

353
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,403
You stupid bastard.

354
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,615
Then what should we do now?

355
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:41,915
Let's go to the meeting location first.

356
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:46,294
Let's see what Inaishingi,
or whatever he is, says this time.

357
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,631
Still, just in case...

358
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,509
keep this with you.

359
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,469
Let's go back.

360
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:59,182
You want to retreat
just because of an epidemic?

361
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,351
The problem is not the epidemic.

362
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,603
It's the fact that
everyone finds it ominous.

363
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,857
Moreover, everyone found out
that Inaishingi is missing.

364
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,359
He will come back soon.

365
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,527
And if he doesn't?

366
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,237
What will you do then?

367
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,739
If this persists,

368
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,534
it's a matter of time
before the union falls apart.

369
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,161
Yes. We should go back
across the Notsan River

370
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:25,000
and reorganize the troops
before it gets even more out of hand.

371
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,501
That is not easy either.

372
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,129
If we retreat like this
without Inaishingi,

373
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,464
how can we be sure
that the union will be fine?

374
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,428
Announce a ten-people meeting now.

375
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,932
Inaishingi has returned.

376
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,228
It's Inaishingi.
It's Inaishingi.

377
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,814
Inaishingi has returned.
Inaishingi has returned.

378
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,339
Inaishingi.

379
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,591
Thank you for being alive.

380
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,801
Thank you for being alive.

381
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,471
Thank you for being alive.
Thank you for being alive.

382
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,972
Inaishingi.

383
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,767
Thank you, Inaishingi.

384
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,562
I knew you would come back alive.

385
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,939
I believed in you. Thank you.

386
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,024
MYONITA

387
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,078
Did you see that?

388
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,956
He's my friend. My best friend.

389
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,167
"Inaishingi." You saw that, right?

390
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,251
EUNSEOM'S FRIEND

391
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,545
He's that friend
you told us about last time, right?

392
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,672
HAE TRIBE, GYEOKMULSA

393
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,965
Yes. I told you,
we tried to save our friends...

394
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,258
HAE KKADAK'S SON

395
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,136
...who were dragged away as slaves,
but everyone was caught except me.

396
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,389
I just wished for him to be alive.

397
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,891
But why did they look at your friend

398
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,643
and say, "Ikomahis"?

399
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,853
I don't know.

400
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,066
Just what does "Ikomahis" mean?

401
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,235
What does it mean
and why won't you tell me?

402
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,653
Ah, well,

403
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,198
there were people who attacked Remus,
our hometown--

404
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,702
We don't know the details either.

405
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,329
So try to arrange a meeting
with your friend.

406
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,304
You went missing,
leaving your sword and armor behind,

407
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,224
so we were very worried, Inaishingi.

408
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,685
Is that so?

409
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,771
Thank you.

410
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,565
It's nothing.

411
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,900
I'll excuse myself now.

412
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,033
Does the Ago Tribe

413
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,162
really think nothing of Igutus?

414
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,623
Arthdal is the strange one.

415
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,750
This is normal.

416
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,419
That is probably why
they served Eunseom as Inaishingi.

417
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,215
It's a world I've never imagined.

418
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,967
That's not the problem right now.

419
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,802
That Buksoe guy just now.

420
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,222
- Do you know him?
- Eunseom's Wahan friend.

421
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,057
I've only seen him once.

422
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,768
What are you going to do now?

423
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,519
You don't know any of their names.

424
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,146
You'll get caught soon.

425
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,152
That night,

426
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,404
I fell into the traps of Arthdal

427
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,989
and was on the brink of death.

428
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,910
If it wasn't for her,

429
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,037
I wouldn't have been able to make it back.

430
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:01,257
I, Eunseom, the reincarnation
of Inaishingi of the Ago Tribe,

431
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,177
express my gratitude to you.

432
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,430
You're the savior of all of the Ago Tribe.

433
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,397
Elders,

434
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,901
will you not pay respect
to the savior of the Ago Tribe?

435
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,368
Chief Pasa of Myo Clan of the Ago Tribe.

436
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,037
I express my gratitude to the savior.

437
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,915
Well, sure.

438
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,000
He is Pasa.

439
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,336
Elder Suhana of Tae Clan of the Ago Tribe.

440
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,255
I express my gratitude to the savior.

441
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,131
Suhana, an elder of Tae Clan.

442
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,467
Chief Sul Sagang of Sul Clan
of the Ago Tribe.

443
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,386
I express my gratitude to the savior.

444
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,429
Sul Sagang, an elder of Sul Clan.

445
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,557
Chief Chosayi of Byeok Clan
of the Ago Tribe.

446
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,225
In the name of the northern God,

447
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,935
Chosayi.
I thank you.

448
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,311
The chief of Byeok Clan.

449
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:08,074
A lot of warriors find this ominous
and are afraid.

450
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:11,035
They think it's people's turn next.

451
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,458
It's the curse
of the Arth gods, Inaishingi.

452
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,543
Come on.

453
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,003
Will you keep talking nonsense?

454
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,796
Tachukan, stop it.

455
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,007
Those fine horses

456
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,968
are the horses of Arthdal
brought by the horse of the heavens.

457
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,261
Look.

458
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,638
Only the horses of Ago fell sick.

459
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,934
In the past, Inaishingi also stopped
in front of the Notsan River

460
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,812
- to avoid the curse of the Arth gods.

461
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:38,897
Curse of the gods?

462
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,524
There's no such thing.

463
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,650
Inaishingi.

464
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,486
I heard an epidemic is common
during a war.

465
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,741
Chilja disease?

466
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,409
It's an epidemic for horses.

467
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,246
It's the epidemic we spread to Neanthals

468
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,664
on the Red Night of Atturad.

469
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,292
So Sarams won't get sick.

470
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,294
Only Neanthals and horses will.

471
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,296
How do you know that?

472
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,964
Were you even born at that time?

473
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,133
It was my father who did it.

474
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,510
It was Harim?

475
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,888
But...

476
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,349
how come nobody knows about it?

477
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:18,269
Because he didn't want people to know.

478
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,733
Then...

479
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,069
what happens to those sick horses?

480
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,904
There's no way to heal them.

481
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,574
Those that will live will live.
Those that will die will die.

482
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:36,079
But why aren't the horses from Arthdal
getting affected?

483
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,872
After the Red Night,

484
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,792
a lot of Arthdal horses died
from the Chilja disease too.

485
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,295
But at some point,
Arthdal horses wouldn't catch the disease.

486
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,341
- Why?
- I don't know.

487
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,804
There must be a reason
that we do not know of yet.

488
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,430
If there was a way to spread it,

489
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,683
there must be a way
to stop it from spreading further.

490
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,476
I cannot guarantee it, but...

491
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,939
Hey. Why are you even curious about that?

492
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,524
We need to escape quickly. You...

493
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,320
are the general of Arthdal.

494
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,655
Is there a way or not?

495
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,864
What if there is a way?

496
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,743
Are you really going to pretend
to be Inaishingi?

497
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:21,416
It is not the curse of the Arth gods
that makes the horses of Ago fall ill.

498
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,794
A yeomari
who is hiding among the Ago Tribe...

499
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,962
SPY

500
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,755
...spread the disease.

501
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,678
What does that mean?

502
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,639
I, Inaishingi,

503
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,852
will make sure to catch the yeomari
and hold them accountable.

504
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,191
Yeomari...

505
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,780
I am sure there is a yeomari.

506
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,574
How would Arthdal have known

507
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,326
that we were going to Pyeongmire
in the previous battle?

508
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,246
You're right. There's no explanation
for it unless that was the case.

509
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,749
So who is it?

510
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,002
Most of us have lived
with each other for a long time.

511
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:11,591
I noticed that there has been a yeomari
since the last battle.

512
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,095
But if we don't catch the yeomari now,
people will doubt each other.

513
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,765
Yes. We have no choice
but to find them quickly.

514
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,849
Hey, Ipsaeng.

515
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,228
What is going on now?

516
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,897
I should be asking you that.

517
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,148
What took you so long?

518
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,816
Inaishingi has returned already.

519
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,444
He's back already?

520
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,616
What are you doing now?

521
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,994
I told Mirusol to get ready.

522
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,122
Go and find a way to stop the epidemic.

523
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,041
What the hell are you doing?

524
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,543
Are you really going to catch the yeomari?

525
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,547
Whether I catch them or not,
I have nothing to lose.

526
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,884
But I have something to gain.

527
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,095
What will you gain?

528
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,138
The Ago Tribe doubting each other.

529
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,143
The Ago Tribe is linked
with a very loose string.

530
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,479
If I get lucky,
that string will be severed

531
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,397
and they will fight among themselves.

532
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,025
Is this fun to you?

533
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,238
Do I look like I'm having fun?

534
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,782
I'm doing this to survive.

535
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,869
I'm a defeated general,
and I don't want to go back as one.

536
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,162
What if you catch them?

537
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,290
What if there really is
a yeomari from Arthdal

538
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,084
and you catch them?

539
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,504
There really is a yeomari.

540
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,297
Red Claw.

541
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,842
I don't know who that is.

542
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:39,220
Exactly.
That yeomari is important to Arthdal.

543
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,764
But you're going to get rid of them?

544
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,599
You, the general of Arthdal?

545
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,434
What do you gain from it?

546
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,729
Answer me. Just what do you gain from it?

547
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,024
Eunseom took my place.

548
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,154
I don't see why I can't do the same.

549
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:58,948
You...

550
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,703
Nothing has been decided.

551
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,204
It's just...

552
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,418
I have one more option in my life.

553
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,437
You...

554
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,939
know.

555
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,442
You bastard, why are you here?

556
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,944
How did you know?

557
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,030
No one else did.

558
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,657
Those who didn't know
Eunseom had a benetbeot would be deceived.

559
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,742
TERM FOR "TWIN" IN WAHAN

560
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,203
I see. How interesting.

561
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,331
That might be true.

562
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,126
So, did you find Eunseom?

563
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,255
- Did you meet him?
- You really are fearless.

564
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,341
The general of Arthdal dares come here...

565
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,011
You'll be torn into three pieces
and your head will be mounted.

566
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,556
Then the Ago Union
will be torn into 30 pieces.

567
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,768
"The Inaishingi that returned is fake."

568
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,355
No. "The real Inaishingi is missing."

569
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,065
What will happen?

570
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,734
And above all else,
will they believe you?

571
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,070
Crazy bastard.

572
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,321
Go out and shout.

573
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:24,617
"He is a fake.
He is the benetbeot of Inaishingi."

574
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,994
"He is the general of Arthdal." Do it.

575
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,081
You bastard.

576
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,415
I will kill you.

577
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,441
What are you doing?

578
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,694
Let's do it.

579
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,362
Who was it?

580
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,530
Right.

581
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,741
Tachukan.

582
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,660
Tachukan!

583
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,418
- What are you doing?
- Ipsaeng!

584
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,336
That bastard isn't Inaishingi.

585
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,299
What nonsense is that?

586
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,010
That bastard isn't Inaishingi.

587
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,136
They are benetbeot.

588
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,471
Ipsaeng, what is wrong with you?
Are you mad?

589
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,348
He is Inaishingi's benetbeot.

590
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,183
He isn't Inaishingi.

591
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:32,768
Are you

592
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,730
Arthdal's yeomari?

593
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,066
You bastard!

594
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,484
You bastard.

595
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,071
He seemed suspicious,
so I interrogated him.

596
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,823
Then he suddenly attacked me.

597
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:49,785
Something seemed strange when he released
Syoreujagin and disappeared with Dalsae.

598
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,121
When did you come back? What about Dalsae?

599
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,042
He is with the real Inaishingi. Why?

600
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,546
I'm a fake? Then where's the real one?

601
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,720
You said you went to find me.

602
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,971
Did you meet me?

603
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,932
- Where was I?

604
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,769
Were you really looking for me?

605
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,270
You lunatic!

606
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,397
What are you doing? What are you planning?

607
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,275
- Tell me!
- What's wrong with you, Ipsaeng?

608
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,110
Please.

609
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,779
Please.

610
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,948
He is the general of Arthdal.

611
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,202
He is Inaishingi's benetbeot.

612
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,329
That's absurd.

613
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,206
What do you mean, a benetbeot?

614
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,375
How can...

615
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:43,047
everyone of the Ago Tribe
get deceived so easily?

616
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,548
How?

617
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,595
I cannot understand Ipsaeng's behavior,

618
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,888
but this alone--

619
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,473
Why is it just "this alone"?

620
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,642
He tried to kill Inaishingi.

621
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,976
Do we need more evidence?

622
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,188
Since when was it?
Since when did you do this?

623
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,481
It's not me.

624
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,527
He did it himself.

625
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,778
Shut up.

626
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,785
Answer me then.

627
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,621
If you are Inaishingi, answer me.

628
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,374
What was the name of our friend

629
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,418
who died

630
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,087
in Gitbadak of Doldambul?

631
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,757
Tell me.

632
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,093
There's no way you wouldn't know.

633
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,303
There's no way you would forget.

634
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,857
Was it Sateunik?

635
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:47,820
That was a very sad dream.

636
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,364
Together,

637
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,492
we will deliver the news

638
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,916
to Sateunik's wife on his behalf,

639
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,209
and go see

640
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,295
his ocean.

641
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,714
What?

642
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,093
That's correct.

643
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,347
The oath we made that day.

644
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,478
Ipsaeng!

645
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,813
You bastard.

646
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,331
Inaishingi is Aramun Haesulla?

647
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,710
Does that make sense?

648
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,879
No.

649
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,297
Why won't it make sense?

650
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,381
You can just do it.

651
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,468
Yes, you can do that.

652
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,095
If the Ago Tribe and Arthdal
both follow you,

653
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,597
we won't have to fight.

654
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,892
But why do you look so down?

655
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,235
Father Yeolson made iron swords.

656
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,111
Iron?

657
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,113
He made swords out of iron?

658
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,786
Do you know what really drives me crazy?

659
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,706
I'm afraid I might lose.

660
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,793
I'm afraid that I might lose...

661
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,338
to Arthdal in the end.

662
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,318
Your Highness, why did you summon me?

663
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:57,324
I just want to exchange things with you
and strengthen our friendship.

664
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,493
I see.

665
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,539
If that is the case,
I have nothing to give you.

666
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,708
The benetbeot of General Saya.

667
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,544
See?

668
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,921
We have something to exchange.

669
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,716
Sit down.

670
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:21,974
Tell me about Saya's benetbeot.

671
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,559
Benetbeot?

672
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,811
What do you mean?

673
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,315
What relationship
does the Wahan Tribe have

674
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,775
with Saya's benetbeot?

675
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,860
Pardon?

676
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,237
I have no idea what you're saying.

677
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,532
What relationship does he have
with the High Priest?

678
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,617
I do not know.

679
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,622
Then why did you guys
help him escape from here?

680
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,791
Someone saw you that night.

681
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,253
You could make
countless witnesses like that.

682
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,801
Would I need a witness
to deal with someone like you?

683
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,313
This is the price for my question.

684
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,982
A sorghum field in the south of Aram.

685
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,610
You can answer my question,

686
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,655
and take this and leave.

687
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,949
If you don't want to, die.

688
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,034
I'm no longer a slave

689
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:26,413
you can simply kill, Your Highness.

690
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,375
Then I'll kill you with difficulty.

691
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,962
I'm sure you have heard about
the three drugs of the Hae Tribe.

692
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:37,299
Maehonje, mahasin, and bichwisan.

693
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,427
Things would've been easy
if I had maehonje.

694
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,137
A HALLUCINOGEN USED
TO INDUCE CONFESSIONS

695
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,430
I don't have it anymore.

696
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,059
Then what is this?

697
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:49,728
It's bichwisan.

698
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,272
What do you think?

699
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,941
Can you feel how sincere I am

700
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,444
about killing you
if you don't answer me tonight?

701
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,739
Scribe.

702
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:06,829
When I put this away, you will die.

703
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,506
Fine, I understand.

704
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,091
He was part of the Wahan Tribe.

705
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,719
Saya's benetbeot.

706
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,764
You wanted to save him
because you were both in the Wahan Tribe?

707
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,229
A scoundrel was pretending
to be the general of Arthdal,

708
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,189
and you guys tried to save him?

709
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,525
We didn't try to save him.
We tried to kill him.

710
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,570
He found out
that he had the same face as Lord Saya,

711
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,198
showed up pretending to be the general,
and tried to run away with Tanya.

712
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,660
They've been close since they were young
because they were born on the same day.

713
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,953
What should we have done?

714
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,913
He's unpredictable.

715
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,416
For our safety and for the High Priest,

716
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,835
we had to get rid of him.

717
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,420
So?

718
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,339
Did you kill him?

719
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,469
Did you kill him?

720
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,638
The other people of the Wahan Tribe
didn't listen.

721
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,517
But he's far away.

722
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,144
I don't know where he went.

723
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,647
He won't show up again
since he wants to live.

724
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,154
You really are insane.

725
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,031
Just trust me.

726
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,200
The real Eunseom will come.

727
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,205
What will you do if I'm right?

728
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,292
If a man
from Arthdal took Inaishingi's place...

729
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,961
That is nonsense.

730
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,089
Why would he suddenly have a benetbeot?

731
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,010
So just

732
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,304
give me the benefit of the doubt

733
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,264
and go wait at Bijaram Hut.

734
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,392
He will come with Dalsae.

735
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,484
It was the blue moss bug,
just as I thought.

736
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,656
This caused the illness?

737
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,534
Yes. When they hatch,
they stick to bats, birds,

738
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,953
and especially horses,
and don't fall off easily.

739
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,247
They fly around and spread the disease.

740
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,583
Then did the yeomari spread these bugs?

741
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,757
There should be more places like this.

742
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,384
We must find them and bury them.

743
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,969
Yes, ma'am.

744
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,015
Do you also think

745
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,476
that the man named Ipsaeng

746
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,687
is a yeomari?

747
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,399
I heard he worked
with you guys for a long time.

748
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:42,901
Don't you trust him?

749
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:46,321
Whether I trust him or not doesn't matter.

750
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,198
What's important is

751
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,826
that everyone who knows Ipsaeng
is thinking the same.

752
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,454
Ipsaeng has betrayed us before.

753
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,083
Multiple times.

754
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,385
BIJARAM HUT

755
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,516
Take your merchants
and go to Molabeol Castle.

756
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,978
Why would I go there?

757
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,354
- Darn it.
- Darn it.

758
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,148
Go and wait for my order.

759
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,152
Hey.

760
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,362
Am I in the Ago Tribe?
Am I your subordinate?

761
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,781
Don't kid yourself.

762
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,121
It's the Doldambul trading document.

763
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,212
Damn it.

764
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,548
With the bronze trading rights gone,
this is...

765
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,675
This isn't an exclusive right.

766
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,344
Hey.

767
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,679
I might rethink my decisions
about helping you.

768
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,473
That's for after the job's done.

769
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,266
What?

770
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,186
Goodness.

771
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,522
- Dalsae.
- Badoru.

772
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,239
Badoru, what's wrong?

773
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,454
Inaishingi, do you really have...

774
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,124
a benetbeot brother?

775
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,011
Send someone to Pyeongmire.

776
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:36,515
Tell them to catch whoever uses
a trading document with my seal on it

777
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,183
and send them to Arthdal.

778
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,560
Yes, Your Highness.
I'll send someone right away.

779
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,187
And keep an eye on all Wahans.

780
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,272
Check who they meet and when they gather.

781
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,482
I understand.

782
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,653
Your Highness. The king has disappeared.

783
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,572
The court meeting is soon.

784
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,574
Is the king not coming?

785
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,160
He needs more rest.

786
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,663
I will lead the court meeting.

787
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,747
Your Highness.

788
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:04,793
Rumor has it that the king has killed
as many as three yakbachis.

789
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,336
Is that true?

790
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,005
He has done no such thing.

791
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,883
- It's a false rumor.
- There are witnesses, Your Highness.

792
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,885
If there are, tell them to come forward.

793
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,721
Isn't it your job to punish those

794
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,265
that spread false rumors
about the royal family?

795
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,183
How can you get swept away together?

796
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:21,935
She is right.

797
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,438
Do not disrupt the court meeting.

798
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,523
There are families of the deceased.

799
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,567
- What should we do about them--
Stop.

800
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,111
The queen already gave you an order.

801
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:34,322
The king himself has to order it.

802
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,908
Where is he?

803
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,551
Your Majesty.

804
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,719
Your Majesty.

805
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,582
Your Majesty.

806
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,043
You're here.

807
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:52,692
"When the zelkova tree cracks
and my sword is revealed,

808
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,654
Aramun shall know their mission."

809
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,242
I did not expect that oracle

810
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,954
to come true this quickly.

811
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:11,169
When the sword is revealed,
but I do not know the mission,

812
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,755
does that mean I am not Aramun?

813
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,633
Is that right?

814
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:22,347
Even after bestowing me sacred blood
and announcing a new dynasty,

815
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:25,851
if I, an insignificant and dirty Igutu,
do not know the mission,

816
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,437
does that mean I am not Aramun?

817
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,649
Your Majesty,
even if you do not know the mission now,

818
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,609
the mission knows you.

819
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,154
The mission will come to you.

820
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,276
I am joking, Niruha.

821
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,738
I no longer not know the mission.

822
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,200
When I look at that sword,

823
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,162
I can see the mission...

824
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,332
as if I'm looking into a mirror.

825
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,501
Right, that bell.

826
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,922
Are you keeping Asa Sin's star bell safe?

827
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,689
Niruha.

828
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:58,777
He clearly said
"sword," "mirror," and "bell."

829
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,321
Does he...

830
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,581
Once the king has recovered completely,

831
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:15,543
he will stand before the people
to stop those false rumors.

832
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,338
The sword of the oracle appeared,

833
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,882
so he will speak Aramun's mission too.

834
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,550
I will do so.

835
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,976
Your Majesty.

836
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:50,578
As the queen has said,
I, the king of Arthdal,

837
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:54,124
the reincarnation of Aramun,
realized the mission of the oracle

838
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,876
after seeing the sword of Aramun

839
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:02,424
I, Tagon, Arthdal's king, Airuju's son,
and the reincarnation of Aramun,

840
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,135
command you as your king.

841
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,804
We will comply, Your Majesty.

842
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,057
Apprehend every man

843
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:16,604
born in the year of the singing wolf
in Arthdal and in the vicinity of Arthdal.

844
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:23,903
If they resist, kill them immediately
regardless of their status.

845
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,238
Your Majesty.

846
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,240
Why would you apprehend them?

847
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,160
Among them are talented people
who support Arthdal

848
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,370
and children of influential families.

849
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,248
Does that command include all of them?

850
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,542
I already said every man

851
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:41,755
who was born
in the year of the singing wolf.

852
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,383
And Commander Yeonbal and Gitoha,

853
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,345
you are put on hold
from going to war until the next order.

854
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,554
Your Majesty.

855
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,577
The year of the singing wolf?

856
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,828
Yes.

857
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,955
That was when the Azure Comet appeared.

858
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:20,377
That was when Niruha,
Lord Saya, and Eunseom were born.

859
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,421
Tagon.

860
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,112
Bring me the medicine from before.

861
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,825
Your Majesty.

862
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,954
Some are children of those
who gave their wealth for the war.

863
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,122
You cannot do this.

864
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,707
You must think of the public sentiment.

865
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,168
People are accepting
purple blood as sacred

866
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:05,130
because the High Priest commanded it.

867
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,757
But if you command them
to apprehend innocent people,

868
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,008
who would accept it?

869
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:12,262
The big war with the Ago Tribe is nearing.

870
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,888
You must take back your command.

871
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,598
If you cannot do that,

872
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,768
you must give a reason
everyone can accept.

873
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,149
Why are you looking at me like that?

874
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,025
There are people trying to kill me.

875
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,360
Who dares to do that?

876
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,239
The prophecy is trying to kill me
and the heavens are trying to abandon me.

877
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,490
The prophecy?

878
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,326
What do you mean?

879
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,495
Your Majesty.

880
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:40,165
You must collect your thoughts
and think straight.

881
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,749
Do not give me advice anymore.

882
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,086
You must've heard
that I killed three yakbachis.

883
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,299
If you do not leave now,
I do not know what I might do.

884
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,633
Leave!

885
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,855
I cannot leave, Your Majesty.

886
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:07,150
I, Chojaha of the Saenyeok Tribe.

887
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,068
As the jwasol of the bang of Jichuk

888
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:12,447
and the person who received
your biggest grace and respect,

889
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:16,284
if I cannot stop you
from taking the wrong path,

890
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,329
I deserve to die. So...

891
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,789
I cannot back down.

892
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:27,045
If I die,
I'll accept it as my fate, Your Majesty.

893
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,281
- Calm down.

894
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,416
Goodness.
- Did you get your ear cut off?

895
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,418
Did the king do this?

896
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:12,882
No way.

897
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,260
The king did that?

898
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,887
What is happening?

899
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,396
The year of the singing wolf?

900
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,065
That was when the Azure Comet appeared.

901
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,734
Perhaps there was an ominous oracle.

902
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,196
The Azure Comet?

903
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,282
Yes, it was that year.

904
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,953
The year the Azure Comet appeared,

905
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:46,082
Cheonbuin came down to the world at once.

906
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,502
Sword, bell, and mirror.

907
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:52,964
Those three will end our world.

908
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,341
Tagon will die.

909
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:59,846
Taealha, you will fall into a deep abyss.

910
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:02,682
Your Highness.

911
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,186
The king cut off Chojaha's ear.

912
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:10,064
It happened when he asked the king
to go back on his order.

913
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,403
Tagon found out about the prophecy.

914
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,530
Pardon?

915
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,408
What prophecy?

916
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:31,127
What did Asa Sakan tell you
when she died?

917
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:39,886
She told me what you'd already heard
and hid from me.

918
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:44,307
Tagon.

919
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,477
Do you think I hid it from you on purpose?

920
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,603
Then?

921
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,230
There was no need to tell you
because it was nonsense.

922
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,859
Did you do something like this
because you believed that?

923
01:00:58,696 --> 01:00:59,947
Don't do this.

924
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,954
That wasn't why you didn't tell me.

925
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,831
What other reason would I have?

926
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,917
You hid the prophecy from me

927
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,211
so you could use it on me

928
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,422
when you needed it.

929
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,058
You were toying with me...

930
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,228
behind my back.

931
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,356
You were always like that.

932
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,607
For your entire life,

933
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:38,319
you've never been completely on my side.

934
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,199
You shouldn't say that to me, Tagon.

935
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:50,748
When we first met,
you were Mihol's yeomari.

936
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,333
When you spent...

937
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,796
the first night with my father
and came to me,

938
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:03,177
you lied to me saying it was horrible
as if you were asking me to save you.

939
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:09,642
That was...

940
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,313
my most desperate sincerity, Tagon.

941
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:20,737
You drove a wedge between us
and instigated me the whole time.

942
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:24,991
In the end, I killed my father...

943
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,952
as you wished.

944
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,996
On the day my father died,

945
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,542
you embraced me and comforted me,
saying I did well.

946
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,634
In the end, you will do the same
to Arok and me.

947
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,179
That is...

948
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,639
who you are.

949
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:01,068
But...

950
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,905
I will not be fooled

951
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,240
by you

952
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,535
nor the prophecy.

953
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,011
Your Highness.

954
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,105
Your Highness.

955
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:41,442
About the poison used by the assassin.

956
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,277
I figured it out.

957
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,282
That was the case.

958
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:55,456
Your Highness, are you okay?

959
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:04,340
Inform the White Mountain Tribe's Elder
Asa Nipa to meet me in secret.

960
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,677
Why do you want to meet the elder?

961
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,772
Is there anyone outside?

962
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:43,898
Tachukan!

963
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,083
Myonita. Myonita!

964
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,043
Call a yakbachi quickly!

965
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,586
Yes, sir.

966
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:10,257
Chaeeun!

967
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,393
What happened?

968
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,645
- She was stabbed.
How?

969
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,713
Thankfully, her injury isn't severe.

970
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:54,343
I guess you were worried about her.

971
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:57,263
She's still young,
so she should heal quickly.

972
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:00,766
I hope so.

973
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:03,394
Are you crying?

974
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,188
I'm not.

975
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:12,737
What do you think sacrifice is?

976
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,904
Sacrifice?

977
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:14,989
Well...

978
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:18,325
Cherishing?

979
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,161
Caring for someone?

980
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,830
Caring for someone unconditionally,
I guess.

981
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,957
I thought
something like that didn't exist.

982
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,085
Was it always like that?

983
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,628
What did you think it was?

984
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:31,505
Obeying?

985
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:33,841
Obligation.

986
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:37,553
Obeying out of obligation.

987
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:39,638
You're unbelievable.

988
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,478
Everyone...

989
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,273
gave their lives...

990
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,610
unconditionally.

991
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:54,945
Inaishingi...

992
01:07:56,906 --> 01:08:00,034
has people acting for him unconditionally.

993
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,628
Inaishingi.

994
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,046
Are you hurt?

995
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,340
No. I am fine.

996
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:19,303
How did Ipsaeng escape from prison?

997
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:21,889
It is my fault.

998
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:23,974
No, it's not.

999
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:29,772
But what brings you here at night?

1000
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,774
We received amazing intelligence.

1001
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:35,736
It says the supplies will be moved
from Hanta Dock to the forest.

1002
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,321
What kind of supplies?

1003
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:38,906
Mostly weapons.

1004
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:41,492
Bows, arrows, and bronze swords.

1005
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:44,245
Inaishingi,
we cannot miss this opportunity.

1006
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:48,749
Yes. If we get enough weapons,
the warriors' morale will increase.

1007
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:55,297
Prepare an appropriate number
of fast warriors.

1008
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:58,759
Inaishingi, let me go.

1009
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,554
Sure. Let's go together.

1010
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:04,014
I will lead them myself.

1011
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,600
You do not have to go yourself...

1012
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,774
No.

1013
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:17,570
I was missing for a long time,
and something unfortunate has happened.

1014
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,363
I need to use this chance

1015
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:21,824
to let the warriors know
that I am alive and well.

1016
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,910
I will lead them.

1017
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:37,089
Badoru, what took you so long?

1018
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:39,341
Hurry up and get ready.
We have an operation.

1019
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:43,971
We should go
and kill the fake one immediately.

1020
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,222
No.

1021
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,057
Go back as if nothing happened.

1022
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:49,268
Don't tell anyone

1023
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,729
and lure that fake imposter to me.

1024
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,026
The whistle arrow is the signal.

1025
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,203
- Hey.
- Gosh.

1026
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,121
Oh... What is it?

1027
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,165
Why do you look so dazed?

1028
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,709
Well...

1029
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:16,545
Right.

1030
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:20,049
Inaishingi said he would join
the operation tomorrow, right?

1031
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,593
Yes.

1032
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:33,812
MOLABEOL CASTLE

1033
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,445
They fell for it.

1034
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:42,738
Is this from Red Claw?

1035
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,324
Yes. The false information
you leaked worked.

1036
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,201
What's more is...

1037
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,786
Inaishingi himself is coming?

1038
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,121
Yes.

1039
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:55,751
Airuju is helping us. We finally
have the chance to catch Inaishingi.

1040
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:59,838
You could end the war
before the general comes.

1041
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:01,590
Form the supply and ambush units

1042
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,342
with elite soldiers.

1043
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,843
Yes, Commander.

1044
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:13,102
Inaishingi.

1045
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:40,838
- It's an ambush.
It's an ambush.

1046
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:49,930
Retreat.

1047
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,265
Retreat.

1048
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:54,143
Retreat.

1049
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:01,775
Open it.

1050
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,406
Oh... It's a trap.

1051
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,409
Attack!

1052
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:14,163
Attack!

1053
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,085
Split up and retreat!

1054
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:37,644
This way.
Here.

1055
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:45,444
Follow them.

1056
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:50,616
Stop them!

1057
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,104
Go.

1058
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:22,314
Now!

1059
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,070
That's him!

1060
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,133
The whistle arrow is the signal.

1061
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:53,762
Inaishingi, keep going.

1062
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:55,889
Hurry up!

1063
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:07,526
Follow them!

1064
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:11,280
Follow them!

1065
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:21,874
Get him!

1066
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,306
THE SWORD OF ARAMUN

1067
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,505
Arthdal will be armed
with iron swords soon.

1068
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,632
Eunseom cannot win.

1069
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:38,260
Even Airuju cannot stop this,
not to mention Asa Sin.

1070
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,386
If you help,

1071
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:42,097
the history of the entire Arth continent
will change.

1072
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,224
Then I must never help you.

1073
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,019
Where is Saya?

1074
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:48,353
The real Saya!

1075
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:50,439
It's over for you, Your Highness.

1076
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,190
I will attack Tagon.

1077
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:53,692
You'll take revenge.

1078
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:56,069
Kill Tagon now.

1079
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:57,821
Let's form an alliance.

1080
01:16:57,821 --> 01:17:00,282
That is the only way we can win.
