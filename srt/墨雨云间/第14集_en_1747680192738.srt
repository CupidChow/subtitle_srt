1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,160
I will make a fire in the clouds

2
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,040
Accept all the gifts of love

3
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,200
I will not fail even if I have regrets

4
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,760
Then I will not give up

5
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,320
Slowly reject the suffering of the world

6
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,800
Pass through the winter and winter, like the old days

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,880
Waiting for the spring to return

8
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:38,800
The Long Ballad

9
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,840
You shouldn't have been against Wan Ning.

10
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
You should have come to protect the formation first.

11
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,400
If we are one step behind, it will be too late.

12
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,040
The full-scale banquet of the Changgong Banquet

13
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,200
Shen Yi Rong will not die on the inside.

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,640
Wan Ning will not easily swallow this breath.

15
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't think that she will not touch you.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,520
She might have wanted to touch you a long time ago.

17
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,880
That's the best.

18
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,360
I want to see how she will touch me.

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,560
I will not let her kill you.

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,520
I will be careful.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,600
Xiao Hong.

22
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,680
If you are gone,

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
there will be no one to trust around me.

24
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,920
Your Majesty, my husband was sent to do the dirty work.

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,080
It's hard to avoid touching him.

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,760
But don't worry.

27
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,480
He will not die.

28
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,360
Your Highness, the Hall Leader of the Zhen Nv Hall

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,840
was escorted to the Hui City's customs office

30
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,880
a thousand miles away.

31
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,720
He has not been allowed to go there yet.

32
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,880
Leave.

33
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,440
Yes.

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,000
Mei Xiang.

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
Send him to the Li family.

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,960
Yes.

37
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,800
Shen Yi Rong.

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,000
What are you trying to do?

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,440
How dare you

40
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,400
to tear my stage in public?

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,600
Don't you think you are too ridiculous sometimes?

42
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,320
That's the words of His Majesty.

43
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,240
If I am not hurt,

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,600
I am not a student.

45
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,240
Your Highness will be punished by His Majesty.

46
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,840
Even if you don't like Jiang Li,

47
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,280
you can't hurt your dignity.

48
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,640
How dare you to object me?

49
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Someone.

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,480
Forget it.

51
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,400
Isn't this what you want?

52
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,560
What do I want?

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,360
You want me to die.

54
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,160
You are talking nonsense.

55
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,360
Wan Ning.

56
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,920
Don't expose yourself

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,000
to the danger.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,840
I can't protect you for several times.

59
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
I have killed him.

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,080
I even went to Qingcheng Mountain.

61
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,560
I went to the place where he was buried.

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
I saw his body

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,800
and buried it in the mud.

64
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,840
But don't you think

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,720
the people of Zhen Nv Hall

66
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,080
disappeared without a reason?

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,000
This is strange.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,560
So what?

69
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,760
I am by your side.

70
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,560
Why don't you tell me

71
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,000
what I should do

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,040
to make you feel at ease?

73
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,640
Alright.

74
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,640
You look so pitiful.

75
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,320
I won't punish you to kneel tonight.

76
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,800
You should take care of your wound.

77
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
I will wipe your body tonight.

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Your Majesty.

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,920
You are talking about state affairs again?

80
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Yes.

81
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
I am sorry.

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
I am sorry.

83
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
I am sorry.

84
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
I am sorry.

85
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Your Majesty.

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
I am sorry.

87
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
I am sorry.

88
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I am sorry.

89
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
I am sorry.

90
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
I am sorry.

91
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
You are leaving?

92
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,920
That's why I am here.

93
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
To relax.

94
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Here.

95
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
I will massage you.

96
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Your Majesty.

97
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
I want to go to Tian Xiang Temple

98
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
to pray for Buddha for a while.

99
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Why do you want to go there?

100
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
I am thinking of Empress Dowager Xia.

101
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
In the past years,

102
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Empress Dowager Xia would go to Tian Xiang Temple

103
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
to pray for Buddha for a while.

104
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Now, I want to go there

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
and pray for Buddha.

106
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Thank you for your kindness.

107
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,920
After I left,

108
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,920
only you went there.

109
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Without you,

110
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,920
I might never have the dumplings

111
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
that you like.

112
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,920
You still remember

113
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,920
that I like children the most.

114
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
At that time,

115
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
you wanted to be close to me.

116
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
To me,

117
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
you are like a child.

118
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
The Emperor's Mansion

119
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Lu.

120
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Lu Zi.

121
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Lu.

122
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
This is...

123
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Guang.

124
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Xiang Li.

125
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Guang.

126
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
I know you are in a bad mood.

127
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
So I brought you

128
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
my favorite dessert.

129
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Who said I was in a bad mood?

130
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
You are still pretending?

131
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
How could I not know

132
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
such a big thing happened to Wan Feng Tang?

133
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Your life

134
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
is going to be a tough one.

135
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Sir.

136
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
Why do you always say something stupid?

137
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
What he said is right.

138
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Before,

139
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
if there was a conflict with them,

140
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
I could still live with them.

141
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
After last night,

142
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
I was completely embarrassed.

143
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Xiang Li.

144
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
What are you going to do?

145
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
I am going to Lu Yang.

146
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
To the Ye family.

147
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Yes.

148
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
How could I forget?

149
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
You have a rich family

150
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
with a great power.

151
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
A rich family

152
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
with a great family.

153
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
And now,

154
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,920
the night festival has just been celebrated by His Majesty.

155
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
The family has been compensated.

156
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
The Ye family is now

157
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,920
trying to get the two ways of the road.

158
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
If you can really

159
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
get back together with the Ye family,

160
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
not only your uncle,

161
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
even your grandmother

162
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
will respect you.

163
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Why do you suddenly

164
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
go to the Ye family?

165
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
In the capital,

166
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
you are now

167
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
famous.

168
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
It's a pity

169
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
that you leave like this.

170
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Duke Su.

171
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
I have arrived.

172
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
You sent a message

173
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
saying that the life is important.

174
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
What is it?

175
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Consort Lv wants to take you out to worship Buddha.

176
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Thank you.

177
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
The play you sang,

178
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
the more people are in the play,

179
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
the more interesting it is.

180
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
In order not to let this play end,

181
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
I kindly remind you

182
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,920
that Consort Lv is the most favored consort in His Majesty.

183
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
I heard about it.

184
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
What are you going to sing in the next play?

185
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
Bixi's Phoenix.

186
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Not in a hurry.

187
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
I think you think

188
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
the night festival is good for you.

189
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Otherwise, how could you

190
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
be willing to

191
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
get back together with the Ye family?

192
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
That night festival

193
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
is good.

194
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
It's a good looking.

195
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Although it's a little bit

196
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
worse than me.

197
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
If she can

198
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
keep protecting Jiang Li,

199
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
it's good.

200
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
And I think

201
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
if they are together often,

202
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
it's convenient for you to start with Liu Xu.

203
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Jiang Li.

204
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
What are you talking about?

205
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
What are you talking about?

206
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
We are good brothers for life.

207
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
We can't fall in love with him.

208
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
What are you doing?

209
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Jiang Jingfei.

210
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
What are you doing?

211
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
What are you doing?

212
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
You are so shy

213
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
to say that.

214
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
What are you doing?

215
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Sister.

216
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
My wife

217
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
broke up with the Ye family.

218
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Now you go to the ball alone.

219
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
I'm afraid you will be wronged.

220
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
Because of this,

221
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
I have to go.

222
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,920
I think this is Jiang Li's wish.

223
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
I want to help her

224
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
to get the understanding of the Ye family.

225
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Sister.

226
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
You are so kind

227
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
to my wife.

228
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
Actually,

229
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
I have my own selfishness.

230
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
I remember Lu Yang

231
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
is not far from Huai Xiang.

232
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Now Jiang Li's reputation

233
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
is already in the capital.

234
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I can also take a break.

235
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
I want to go back to Huai Xiang to see.

236
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Who was it?

237
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
That person

238
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
said my father was guilty.

239
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
He was caught by the police.

240
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
He was caught by the police.

241
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
I'm afraid no one was there

242
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
to help him.

243
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,920
After so long,

244
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
I, an unfilial daughter,

245
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
should go back to see.

246
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Hurry up.

247
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
You Xu and Ye Shi Jie

248
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
should be here soon.

249
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Hurry up.

250
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Okay.

251
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
You Xu.

252
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
You Xu.

253
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Why do you insist on going alone?

254
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
I have been here for a long time.

255
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

256
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
I just went out

257
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
and walked around.

258
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Where is Ye Shi Jie?

259
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Ye Shi Jie?

260
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Ye Shi Jie

261
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
should be the last person

262
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
to come tonight.

263
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Let me make an announcement.

264
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Tonight,

265
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
we will have Ye Shi Jie

266
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
for all the fun and games

267
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
we have.

268
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Father.

269
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Deng Cheng.

270
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
When he arrives,

271
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
I will go with you again.

272
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
Okay.

273
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
He is coming.

274
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Ye Shi Jie.

275
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Ye Shi Jie.

276
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
You are a great official.

277
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Thanks to us,

278
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
you are the most powerful.

279
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Yes.

280
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Ye Shi Jie.

281
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
So you have to treat us today.

282
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
You...

283
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Sorry.

284
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
I forgot to tell you something.

285
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
My uncle often comes here

286
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
to do business.

287
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
He will be back to Lu Yang in a few days.

288
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
So I'm afraid

289
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
I can't spend the Mid-Autumn Festival with you.

290
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
That's so boring.

291
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
We have made a deal.

292
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Whoever comes last will pay for the meal.

293
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
You didn't come before.

294
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
No one else will come.

295
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Yes.

296
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
So boring.

297
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
So boring.

298
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Everyone.

299
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
I'm Ye Shi Jie's uncle.

300
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
I came here by accident.

301
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
I'm sorry to disturb you.

302
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
I feel sorry for you.

303
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,920
I booked a seat at the restaurant.

304
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
If you don't mind,

305
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
let's have a meal together.

306
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
No need.

307
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,920
It's not fun to be in the restaurant.

308
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Besides, you are so straightforward.

309
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
We won't disturb you.

310
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
Okay.

311
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Let's go.

312
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Uncle.

313
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
Since you are so sincere,

314
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
I want to have a good time with you.

315
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Okay.

316
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Little girl.

317
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Jiang Zhen Rui.

318
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
You should have fun with Liu Xu.

319
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
I'll ask you later.

320
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
He left.

321
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Yes.

322
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
So boring.

323
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
So annoying.

324
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
You are so stubborn.

325
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Go home.

326
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
What are you doing?

327
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Liu Xu.

328
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
I know there is a game.

329
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
We need two people to play together.

330
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
And there are prizes.

331
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Who wants to play with you?

332
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
We are here.

333
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Let's play together.

334
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
I swear.

335
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
It must be fun.

336
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
What?

337
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Okay.

338
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
I'll play only one game.

339
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
If it's not fun, I'll go home.

340
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Let's go.

341
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
I heard you from Shijie.

342
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,920
But I didn't expect you to be so famous.

343
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
You called me just now.

344
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
I was surprised.

345
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
I almost didn't recognize you.

346
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Sir, this way please.

347
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
I haven't seen you for a long time.

348
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
Of course I can't recognize you.

349
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Because of this, we are here together.

350
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
We need to celebrate.

351
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Yes.

352
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Come on.

353
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Sit down.

354
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Come on.

355
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
A'Li.

356
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,920
I am honored to be here with you.

357
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,920
I am honored to be your official.

358
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Thanks to you, I heard the people in the city

359
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,920
were praising your fame.

360
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Come on.

361
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,920
This is a toast to you.

362
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Cheers.

363
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
You are welcome.

364
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
I don't dare to drink alone.

365
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,920
This is a toast to you.

366
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,920
You are here to celebrate the family's reunion.

367
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Why don't you come to the Jiang family?

368
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,920
I came here to do business.

369
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
I know.

370
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
So I came in a hurry.

371
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
I didn't inform the Jiang family in advance.

372
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
I'm afraid I'll be disturbed if I go there in a hurry.

373
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
It's for business.

374
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,920
It's more convenient to have the secretary of the central office to help.

375
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
Of course.

376
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,920
But the Jiang family has not been together for many years.

377
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Moreover, there were some misunderstandings before.

378
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,920
I'm afraid it's too rude.

379
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
I know, uncle.

380
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,920
I was young and ignorant.

381
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Now I know the truth.

382
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,920
I have been guilty for many years.

383
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
As long as uncle thinks about it,

384
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,920
I will help him.

385
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
That's great.

386
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,920
I'll visit you tomorrow.

387
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Is it convenient?

388
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Of course.

389
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Since uncle visits the Jiang family,

390
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
we should respond to him.

391
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
Respond?

392
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
How about I go to Luyang with uncle the day after tomorrow

393
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
to visit the Ye family?

394
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,920
Then we can get to know each other better.

395
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,920
You're going to Luyang?

396
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Well, A'Li.

397
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,920
I'm afraid we should fight for the Jiang family's feelings first.

398
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
As long as uncle takes the initiative,

399
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,920
my father won't stop me.

400
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Let's eat first.

401
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
It's getting cold.

402
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Uncle just wants me to sign the letter

403
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
and doesn't want me to go back to the Ye family.

404
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,920
What are you talking about?

405
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
What are you talking about?

406
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Uncle welcomes you to the Ye family.

407
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
Then I'll ask uncle to

408
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,920
make an offer to my father tomorrow.

409
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
It's settled.

410
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Okay.

411
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Okay.

412
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
Let's eat first.

413
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Come on.

414
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
My friend is waiting for me.

415
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
I won't eat now.

416
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
Uncle, cousin,

417
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
you're so kind.

418
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,920
I'll go see cousin.

419
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,920
This Jiang Li is not easy.

420
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,920
Did you think about going back to Luyang early in the morning?

421
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,920
The Ye family is my great-grandfather's family.

422
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
After so many years,

423
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
some misunderstandings should be cleared.

424
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
Why is it so sudden?

425
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
When we entered the palace,

426
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
do you remember the design ceremony?

427
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Yes.

428
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Among them,

429
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
there are the hands of my two sisters.

430
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,920
How could they be?

431
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
So my cousin knows

432
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
my situation in the Jiang family.

433
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Are you still wondering

434
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,920
why I suddenly want to go back to Luyang?

435
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
You call me cousin.

436
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
In the future, in the capital,

437
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,920
I will do my best to protect you.

438
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Thank you.

439
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Let me see you out.

440
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
Uncle is waiting for you.

441
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,920
You go back first.

442
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
I'll go by myself.

443
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Okay.

444
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Master,

445
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
the tickets for the theater are ready.

446
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Tonight's play,

447
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Xiao Tao Hong's Xiao Hong Chen.

448
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
You're going to see Xiao Tao Hong tonight?

449
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Aren't you afraid that the other side will notice and start to attack you?

450
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
In my opinion,

451
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
we don't care about the three-time show,

452
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
we'll take the theater first.

453
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
It's the safest this way.

454
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,920
I'm safe.

455
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
But the play is gone.

456
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Master,

457
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
I'm in danger.

458
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,920
I'm afraid that the theater will be destroyed.

459
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,920
I'm afraid that the theater will be destroyed.

460
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm afraid that the theater will be destroyed.

461
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
I'm afraid that the theater will be destroyed.

462
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Master,

463
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
you're still watching the play?

464
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
I'm cleaning the snake.

465
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
You're teaching me how to do things?

466
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Lu Ji is right.

467
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
If you want to catch a big fish,

468
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
you have to put a long line.

469
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Not only do you have to watch it,

470
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,920
I also have to find someone to watch it with me.

471
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Make this play a good one.

472
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Find someone?

473
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Who?

474
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Is it so troublesome?

475
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
I'll just watch it with you.

476
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Stupid.

477
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
I said, Lu Da,

478
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
why are you so nagging today?

479
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
I know.

480
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,920
You want to go to the theater, don't you?

481
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
Okay, okay, you go.

482
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Find a

483
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
soft-hearted woman.

484
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Just kidding.

485
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Our secret guards are all men.

486
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Women?

487
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Jiuyue?

488
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
No,

489
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
find her.

490
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
It's better than just pulling one on the street.

491
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Then just pull one on the street.

492
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Lady Jiao,

493
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,920
my master wants to invite you to the theater.

494
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,920
If you don't want to go,

495
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Let's go.

496
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Okay, okay, okay.

497
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Where is Wenji?

498
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
What do you want from me, Duke Su?

499
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Can you change your job?

500
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
You are free again.

501
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
I'm free again.

502
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Please come to the theater.

503
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Can you

504
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
show me your kindness?

505
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Show you my kindness?

506
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
Show me your kindness?

507
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
I'm not going to show you my kindness.

508
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
I'm not going to show you my kindness.

509
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
I'm not going to show you my kindness.

510
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
I'm not going to show you my kindness.

511
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
You are too good at

512
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
calculating people's feelings.

513
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
If Duke Su doesn't want to,

514
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
I'll just go.

515
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Just one.

516
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Two left.

517
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
You are too good at calculating.

518
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
I'm afraid you'll suffer a loss.

519
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm calculating every moment.

520
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Three kinds of tea,

521
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,920
one cup of water.

522
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
I don't know how to make tea.

523
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
I can only choose one cup at will.

524
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
I've failed Duke Su's kindness.

525
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
There's nothing to be proud of.

526
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
It's just bitterness,

527
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
color, freshness, sweetness.

528
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
Different people

529
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
love different tea.

530
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
I chose bitter tea.

531
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
You chose the sweetest

532
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
tea, but you drink bitterness.

533
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
You chose the sweetest tea, but you drink bitterness.

534
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,920
This means

535
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
in your heart,

536
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
there's a lot of bitterness.

537
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Duke Su is joking.

538
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Maybe my taste

539
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
is different from others.

540
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Others drink bitter tea,

541
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
but I drink sweet tea.

542
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
In your eyes,

543
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
what is bitterness?

544
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
What is bitterness?

545
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Life, work, illness, death.

546
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Love, hate,

547
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
love, hatred.

548
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
In this world,

549
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
there's a lot of bitterness.

550
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Love and affection.

551
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
In your heart,

552
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,920
is it a bitter thing?

553
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Duke Su,

554
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
you invited me to watch a play.

555
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Are you going to talk to me

556
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
about love and affection?

557
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
No?

558
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Let's start the play.

559
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Great!

560
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Great!

561
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Great!

562
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Great!

563
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Li is really a person who knows the play.

564
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
I can see you are enjoying it.

565
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,920
This play is really

566
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
good.

567
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
The good play is still behind.

568
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
The spring flowers are blooming.

569
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Great!

570
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Great!

571
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
Reward.

572
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Thank you, Duke Su.

573
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Little Peach Blossom has a good sense of humor.

574
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Duke Su,

575
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
what do you think of the play today?

576
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
You are not asking me.

577
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,920
It's the lady beside me.

578
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
A man who knows the play

579
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
and is good at shooting.

580
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
No wonder you are the

581
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
seat of Duke Su.

582
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
This lady not only knows the play,

583
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
but also the play.

584
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
You are not allowed to leave the fire gate.

585
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
You must leave the room behind the table.

586
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
Take her away.

587
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Yes.

588
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,920
I'm leaving.

589
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Thank you, Duke Su.

590
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
You are the one who helped me.

591
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
I don't owe you anything.

592
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
If you are the one who is kind,

593
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
I will be the bad person.

594
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,920
You are so afraid of

595
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,920
owing me a favor.

596
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
A favor is also a debt.

597
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,920
You still have to pay it back.

598
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,920
People are already

599
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,920
a lot of people.

600
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,920
You owe too much

601
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
and you have to pay it back.

602
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
But you helped me

603
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
to be honest in the situation.

604
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Have you forgotten it?

605
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
You are blaming me?

606
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Since you changed me to this theater,

607
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
I have been a good person.

608
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
From the beginning,

609
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
I said it well.

610
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
I am your passenger.

611
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
I am actually your wife.

612
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
This is because of the people around you

613
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,920
who ambushed the theater.

614
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,920
They made the troupe lose their guard.

615
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
As for you,

616
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,920
I blame you.

617
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Not really.

618
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,920
I am the one

619
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,920
who can do this to Duke Su.

620
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,920
I am very grateful.

621
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
I am sorry.

622
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
I am sorry.

623
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,920
I am sorry.

624
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
I am sorry.

625
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,920
I am sorry.

626
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
I am sorry.

627
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
I am sorry.

628
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,920
I am sorry.

629
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
I am sorry.

630
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
I am sorry.

631
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
I am sorry.

632
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
I am sorry.

633
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
I am sorry.

634
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
I am sorry.

635
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
I am sorry.

636
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
I am sorry.

637
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
I am sorry.

638
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
I am sorry.

639
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
I am sorry.

640
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
I am sorry.

641
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,920
I am sorry.

642
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,920
These people

643
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,920
choose to relieve the temper

644
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
of the people around them.

645
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,480
Rebellion is a crime of killing people.

646
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,600
How much did Lord Chen give you

647
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
to sell your life for him?

648
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,640
I'll pay you three times.

649
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,440
Do you really think

650
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,520
you can be the Princess Consort

651
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,120
of Lord Chen with just a play?

652
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,240
I'm tired of it.

653
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,160
Lu Jin,

654
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,120
draw a play on his face

655
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,880
and put on the eye drops

656
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,280
and throw away the gold.

657
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,680
If Lord Chen wants you,

658
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,680
I'll give you three taels as a road fee.

659
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,880
What's wrong with Chu Xun today?

660
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,160
He usually plays with you all day.

661
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,200
Don't you play with me?

662
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,000
Don't do it, Lei.

663
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,440
Okay.

664
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,720
I'll tell him.

665
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,960
Didn't you catch him?

666
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,080
Why do you feel bad?

667
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,200
When you asked me

668
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,120
why I see這樣

669
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,520
you said

670
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,240
On the day of your wedding,

671
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,420
you saw His Lordship

672
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,420
I was scared to death.

673
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
What are you going to do next?

674
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,420
I have a feeling that

675
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,420
Si Yan is just one of the ways.

676
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,420
There must be a bigger way.

677
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,420
How is the killer?

678
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,420
He gave me an information

679
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,420
that the King of Cheng is in Lu Yang.

680
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,420
He has set up a place

681
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,420
for training the killer.

682
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,420
He is just one of the places.

683
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,420
If he doesn't go down,

684
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,420
before the King of Cheng died,

685
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,420
the people around you

686
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,420
might be killed by Lu Xu.

687
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,420
So you are going to Lu Yang in person?

688
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,420
Yes.

689
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,420
Prime Minister Jiang,

690
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,420
I am new here.

691
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,420
I am here to thank you.

692
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,420
This matter is not about me.

693
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,420
It has nothing to do with me.

694
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,420
It is just that I came here

695
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,420
to visit you.

696
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,420
I am afraid that I have nothing to do.

697
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
You can't hide anything from me.

698
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,420
This is my second uncle, Ye Ming Xuan.

699
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,420
He came from Lu Yang.

700
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,420
He has prepared some gifts.

701
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,420
Please accept them.

702
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,420
Prime Minister Jiang,

703
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,420
it has been a long time.

704
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,420
It has been a long time.

705
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,420
You are my brother.

706
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,420
Why didn't you

707
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,420
say hello to me in advance?

708
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,420
Well...

709
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,420
Father.

710
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
Father,

711
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,420
we just met at the lantern show.

712
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,420
It was a good time.

713
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
It can't be too late.

714
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,420
I invited my second uncle,

715
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,420
Ye Ming Xuan,

716
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,420
and my second uncle

717
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,420
to come here together.

718
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,420
Please sit.

719
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,420
It has been a long time

720
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
since you came to the capital.

721
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,420
Yes.

722
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,420
I came here this time

723
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,420
to deal with some business.

724
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,420
I came here to see my free time.

725
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,420
After all, I have been away from home for so long.

726
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,420
I can't help but worry about my family.

727
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
In the future,

728
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
I will be an official in the court.

729
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,420
Please take care of me.

730
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,420
It's serious.

731
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,420
You are talented and righteous.

732
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,420
I don't think you need to

733
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,420
write a letter of apology.

734
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
Madam Ye,

735
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,420
how are you?

736
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,420
I can still support you.

737
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
But I have been

738
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,420
missing my family

739
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
for a year.

740
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,420
I miss my family

741
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,420
more and more

742
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,420
as I get older.

743
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,420
So this time,

744
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,420
I have a favor to ask.

745
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420
Ah Li.

746
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,420
Ah Li has never

747
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,420
returned to Lu Yang since he was born.

748
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,420
I wonder if you

749
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
allow me

750
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,420
to take Jiang Li back

751
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,420
to see Madam Ye.

752
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,420
Go back to Lu Yang?

753
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,420
Yes.

754
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,420
Ah Li didn't want to when he was a child.

755
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,420
But now he has grown up.

756
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,420
I asked him about it.

757
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,420
He also wants to go back and see.

758
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,420
Lu Yang is a long way.

759
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,420
Li just came back.

760
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,420
It's not appropriate to go south now.

761
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,420
Father,

762
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,420
I have never been to Lu Yang.

763
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,420
If you allow me,

764
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,420
I would like to go back.

765
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,420
I was thinking

766
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,420
that the exam is over

767
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,420
and I have nothing to do.

768
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,420
I want to go back to Lu Yang.

769
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,420
You have been on the road

770
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,420
and you have never been to Lu Yang.

771
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,420
You must be not used to it.

772
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,420
Father, you worry too much.

773
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,420
Li

774
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,420
is used to living

775
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,420
in the Zhen Nv Hall in Qingcheng Mountain.

776
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,420
Lu Yang

777
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,420
is much more lively

778
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,420
than Zhen Nv Hall.

779
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,420
I heard from your mother

780
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,420
that

781
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,420
Consort Li

782
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
wants to take you

783
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,420
to practice Buddhism.

784
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,420
The imperial decree will be delivered soon.

785
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,420
At this time,

786
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,420
it's better for you to stay in the capital.

787
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Since the second girl

788
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,420
wants to go to Lu Yang,

789
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,420
let her go.

790
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,420
Mother.

791
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,420
Consort Li

792
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,420
can wait for her to come back.

793
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,420
Let Shu Ran talk to her.

794
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Consort Li is old and young.

795
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,420
She will understand.

796
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,420
For the sake of the Sui family,

797
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,420
the second girl

798
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,420
has suffered for days.

799
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,420
She should go out

800
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,420
and relax.

801
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,420
Moreover,

802
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Mrs. Ye

803
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,420
used to love the second girl.

804
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,420
Now she is old.

805
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,420
She should go back and see her.

806
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
Actually,

807
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,420
I discussed this with you before.

808
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,420
Consort Li

809
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,420
asked me to go to the Li Buddha's

810
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,420
for real.

811
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,420
Don't you understand?

812
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,420
It's all in the past.

813
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,420
Even if I really have a mistake,

814
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,420
can you say that

815
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,420
the third and fourth girls

816
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,420
are not at fault?

817
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,420
You are the head of the family.

818
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,420
You can't be biased to this.

819
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,420
Li just came back from the Zhen Nv Hall.

820
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,420
She has to suffer in the mountains.

821
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,420
It's good for Shu Ran and Consort Li

822
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,420
to walk together.

823
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,420
But what should I say

824
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,420
and what shouldn't I say?

825
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,420
As her husband,

826
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,420
you should be on her side.

827
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,420
Shu Ran is a man of great heart.

828
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,420
What should I say

829
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,420
and what shouldn't I say

830
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,420
will be heard by His Majesty.

831
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,420
You are the official of the country.

832
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,420
It's not good to be

833
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,420
questioned about your family.

834
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,420
Think about it.

835
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,420
That girl went to Lu Yang

836
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,420
to escape from the Li Buddha.

837
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,420
She wanted to find a support in Lu Yang.

838
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,420
From this,

839
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,420
she knew that there was no position in the Jiang family.

840
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,420
She wanted to use this opportunity

841
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,420
to please her father

842
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,420
and to get back her reputation

843
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,420
in the house of the noble lady.

844
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,420
When she came back,

845
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,420
she had no place in the capital.

846
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,420
Did you hear me?

847
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,420
Did I really cancel

848
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,420
the engagement with Zhou Yan?

849
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,420
There will be better things in the future.

850
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,420
But I really like her.

851
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,420
Yao.

852
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,420
You are still young.

853
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,420
When you grow up,

854
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,420
love is the most unworthy thing in the world.

855
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,420
I only want Mr. Zhou.

856
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,420
I have found another family for you.

857
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,420
Don't mention him again.

858
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,420
Cousin.

859
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,420
Jiang Lin.

860
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,420
Take this.

861
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,420
This is your favorite.

862
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,420
This is for cooling down the heat.

863
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,420
It's hard to change on the road.

864
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,420
Eat more.

865
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,420
And me.

866
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,420
This is my favorite.

867
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,420
This is my mother's favorite.

868
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,420
This is my father's favorite.

869
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,420
Eat them all.

870
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,420
Be careful on the road.

871
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,420
Tong.

872
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,420
You gave me so many delicious things.

873
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,420
These are your favorite.

874
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,420
Your parents' favorite.

875
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,420
You want to make me fat?

876
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,420
Tong.

877
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,420
You went so far.

878
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,420
I don't know what you need.

879
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,420
What do you need?

880
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,420
Ye family is a big business.

881
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,420
I have told uncle.

882
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,420
I will take good care of him.

883
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,420
Li.

884
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,420
It's almost time.

885
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,420
Let's go.

886
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,420
So early.

887
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,420
I am leaving.

888
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,420
Jiang Li.

889
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,420
We just met.

890
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,420
We haven't eaten anything.

891
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,420
We are going to be separated.

892
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,420
The last party was my fault.

893
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,420
When Jiang Li comes back.

894
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
I will make up for the last meal.

895
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,420
What do you think?

896
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,420
Ye cousin.

897
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,420
You are so interesting.

898
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,420
You still remember it.

899
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,420
You.

900
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,420
Who wants you to make up for it?

901
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,420
I will make Li the president.

902
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
Because you owe me this.

903
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,420
Okay.

904
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,420
I will come back as soon as possible.

905
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,420
Make up for this.

906
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,420
I will come back.

907
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,420
I will come back.

908
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,420
I will make them pay.

909
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,420
Master.

910
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,420
According to the clues.

911
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,420
I know the director of Lu Yang.

912
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,420
Is his new wife Chu Lan.

913
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,420
But Chu Lan is not often in Lu Yang.

914
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,420
He is very strange.

915
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,420
I asked all the people in Lu Yang.

916
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,420
I know he has a good friend.

917
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,420
The leader of Xihua House.

918
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,420
Wu Lan.

919
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,420
Where is Li family?

920
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,420
They have passed the night market.

921
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,420
They have attacked Ye family.

922
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,420
What is Ye family's reaction?

923
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,420
They are slow.

924
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,420
They don't know they are in the trap.

925
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,420
Ye family can be captured so easily.

926
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,420
I can only say.

927
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,420
The past days are too easy.

928
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,420
When will we be in the trap?

929
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,420
It seems.

930
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,420
We are going to Lu Yang.

931
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,420
Master.

932
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,420
What a coincidence.

933
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,420
I heard.

934
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,420
The second wife of Jiang family.

935
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,420
Has also gone to Lu Yang.

936
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,420
She said she will visit her family.

937
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420
Take the five-carbons.

938
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,420
Why this time?

939
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,420
Waste the time to ask for useless things.

940
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,420
Master.

941
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,420
You told me to watch the second wife of Jiang family.

942
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,420
Take the five-carbons.

943
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,420
Be quiet.

944
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,420
Master.

945
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,420
A'Fou.

946
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,420
Master.

947
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,420
Go back to the house.

948
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,420
Tell the old lady and the lady.

949
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,420
Say.

950
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,420
Forget it.

951
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,420
Let's act in a hurry.

952
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,420
Say I am back.

953
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,420
Yes.

954
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,420
Madam.

955
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,420
I am back.

956
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,420
Madam.

957
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,420
A'Li.

958
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,420
Come.

959
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,420
Madam.

960
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,420
Madam.

961
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,420
I am back.

962
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,420
Madam.

963
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,420
Madam.

964
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
What happened?

965
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,420
Where is the house?

966
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,420
Master.

967
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,420
Someone said.

968
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,420
They want to cut the shares.

969
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,420
So the madam went to deal with it.

970
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,420
A'Li.

971
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,420
Your aunt went to deal with something.

972
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,420
I will take you to see them later.

973
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,420
Okay.

974
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,420
Let's go.

975
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,420
We are here.

976
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,420
A'Li.

977
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,420
You should go to rest.

978
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,420
I have to deal with something else.

979
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,420
It may take a little longer.

980
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,420
Uncle.

981
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,420
You go to do your work.

982
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,420
We will take care of ourselves.

983
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,420
Okay.

984
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,420
Wait for your aunt.

985
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,420
I will ask her to take good care of you.

986
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,420
You know your aunt is a good person.

987
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,420
Sister.

988
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,420
Why is no one in the Ye family?

989
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,420
Did they put you in danger?

990
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,420
Did they encounter some trouble?

991
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,420
It is cold these days.

992
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,420
Did you prepare the stove?

993
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,420
Remember to use the red copper one.

994
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,420
Don't burn your hands.

995
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,420
Yes, madam.

996
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,420
Let Xia Yan prepare some red dates.

997
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,420
When he comes back,

998
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,420
I will make chicken soup for him.

999
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,420
I have the dragon phoenix tea in my room.

1000
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,420
It is very hot.

1001
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,420
When he comes back,

1002
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,420
you can order tea for him.

1003
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,420
Yes.

1004
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,420
Madam.

1005
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,420
Do you know?

1006
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,420
Something big happened to the Zhang family.

1007
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,420
Big thing?

1008
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,420
What big thing?

1009
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,420
Mrs. Zhang is at home.

1010
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,420
She is looking for death.

1011
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,420
She has a golden day.

1012
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,420
Do you know why?

1013
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,420
Last night,

1014
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,420
a wild fox came to our house.

1015
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,420
It is a good chance.

1016
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,420
What does the little fox look like?

1017
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,420
She looks like...

1018
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,420
Madam.

1019
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,420
A wild fox came to our house.

1020
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
What?

1021
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,420
Something big happened.

1022
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,420
Ye Mingxuan.

1023
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,420
Ye Mingxuan, you are a phoenix.

1024
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,420
Come out.

1025
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,420
Where is Erlang?

1026
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,420
He just went out.

1027
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,420
A wild fox came to our house.

1028
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,420
Look how I will kill you.

1029
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,420
Madam.

1030
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
Come out.

1031
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,420
Madam.

1032
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,420
You can't do this.

1033
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,420
You are a noble person.

1034
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,420
How can you go to the wild fox?

1035
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,420
Be careful.

1036
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,420
You will be punished.

1037
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,420
What?

1038
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,420
In anger,

1039
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,420
you are willing to make an impulsive move.

1040
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,420
Whether you hit or scold,

1041
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,420
you are just giving the wild fox

1042
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,420
a chance to make an impulsive move.

1043
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,420
Madam.

1044
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,420
Don't get your hands dirty.

1045
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,420
Let me go and see what will happen.

1046
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,420
That's right.

1047
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,420
I will wait in the house.

1048
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,420
You go and do it.

1049
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,420
I will see what will happen today.

1050
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,420
Look at you.

1051
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,420
Open the door.

1052
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,420
Open the door.

1053
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,420
Who is it?

1054
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,420
Open the door.

1055
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,420
Open the door.

1056
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,420
Open the door.

1057
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,420
Do you hear me?

1058
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,420
You are the sister of that wild fox, right?

1059
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,420
Who are you?

1060
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,420
Tell your master to come out.

1061
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,420
I ask who you are.

1062
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,420
What right do you have to ask me who I am?

1063
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,420
Tell your master to come out.

1064
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,420
Don't get my family's place dirty.

1065
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,420
How can you talk like that?

1066
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,420
This is arranged by your master.

1067
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,420
He personally arranged us to live here.

1068
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,420
Little wild fox.

1069
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,420
Come out.

1070
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,420
Come out.

1071
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,420
You are a slave.

1072
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,420
If you want us to leave,

1073
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,420
let your master come and talk to us personally.

1074
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,420
You are a little wild fox.

1075
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,420
You are not allowed to drink.

1076
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,420
You will be punished.

1077
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,420
Wait for me.

1078
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,420
Tong.

1079
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,420
Who was that?

1080
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,420
Why did I hear you two quarreling?

1081
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,420
Sister.

1082
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,420
The Ye family can't live here.

1083
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,420
A slave came just now.

1084
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,420
He said he wanted us to leave.

1085
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,420
He also said you are a little wild fox.

1086
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,420
I am the sister of that wild fox.

1087
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,420
I think the Ye family

1088
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,420
is clearly embarrassed by you.

1089
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,420
Then,

1090
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,420
let's go out first.

1091
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,420
We will talk when Second Uncle comes back.

1092
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,420
I will go out first.

1093
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,420
I will go out first.

1094
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,420
I will go out first.

1095
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:55,920
What a big

1096
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,420
act of violence.

1097
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,420
This little wild fox

1098
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,420
is favored by Second Uncle.

1099
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,420
He doesn't even care

1100
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,420
about me as his wife.

1101
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,420
Yes.

1102
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,420
This little wild fox

1103
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,420
is out of control.

1104
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,420
Madam,

1105
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,420
you have to go out

1106
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,420
to stop this little wild fox.

1107
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,420
Since there is a

1108
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,420
fearless master,

1109
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,420
how can I deal with this little wild fox?

1110
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,420
Madam,

1111
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,420
this little wild fox

1112
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,420
is out of control.

1113
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,420
I know that it's not a good thing.

1114
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,420
I will go and tell the master.

1115
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,420
Little wild fox is out of control.

1116
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,420
Ye Mingxuan,

1117
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,420
I will not spare you.

1118
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,420
Sister,

1119
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,420
where are we going?

1120
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,420
Go with me to see an old friend.

1121
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,420
I will go with you.

1122
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,420
I will go with you.

1123
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,420
I will go with you.

1124
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,420
I will go with you.

1125
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,420
I will go with you.

1126
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,420
I will go with you.

1127
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,420
I will go with you.

1128
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,420
Go with me to see an old friend.

1129
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,420
Old friend?

1130
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,420
Wait.

1131
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,420
Are you looking for Qiong Zhi?

1132
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,420
Qiong Zhi is not at home now.

1133
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,420
Where is he now?

1134
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,420
If you are in a hurry,

1135
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,420
go to Xihua House to find him.

1136
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,420
Xihua House?

1137
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,420
That is the most famous

1138
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,420
Qing House in Luyang.

1139
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,420
Come again.

1140
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,420
Come again.

1141
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,420
I am bored.

1142
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,420
Come again.

1143
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,420
Master,

1144
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,420
this wolf is very alert.

1145
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,420
If we don't control it in advance,

1146
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,420
I am afraid that it will notice us.

1147
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,420
If we alert it,

1148
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,420
the wolf will not appear.

1149
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,420
So?

1150
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,420
We have to disguise as a spring guest.

1151
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,420
We have to approach it,

1152
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,420
control it,

1153
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,420
and use it to lure the wolf out.

1154
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,420
What are you waiting for?

1155
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,420
Let's start.

1156
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,420
Chu Jun,

1157
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,420
who do you think

1158
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,420
we three want to sell as guests?

1159
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,420
Master,

1160
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,420
why are you so late?

1161
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,420
I have an appointment with Ulan.

1162
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,420
Okay,

1163
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,420
don't worry.

1164
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,420
Ulan will be here soon.

1165
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,420
Come,

1166
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,420
sit here for a while.

1167
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,420
Mom,

1168
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,420
a lady is here.

1169
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,420
Lady,

1170
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,420
this is not the place

1171
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,420
you should come.

1172
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,420
I want to find Qiong Zhi.

1173
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,420
Our lady in the flower brand

1174
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,420
does not welcome guests.

1175
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,420
Lady in the flower brand?

1176
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,420
I am not a lady

1177
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,420
who comes to trouble.

1178
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,420
I am looking for Qiong Zhi

1179
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,420
to ask about something.

1180
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,420
Please make yourself at home.

1181
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,420
Lady,

1182
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,420
this is Qiong Zhi's room.

1183
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,420
Who are you?

1184
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,420
What else can a man

1185
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,420
do here?

1186
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,420
This young man

1187
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,420
looks quite outstanding.

1188
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,420
He is in red.

1189
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,420
He looks

1190
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,420
a little more delicate

1191
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,420
than Ulan.

1192
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,420
Now that Ulan is not here,

1193
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,420
why don't you

1194
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,420
have a drink

1195
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,420
with me?

1196
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,420
Can you recognize me?

1197
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,420
I have been investigating for so many years.

1198
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,420
I have no disguise

1199
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,420
that can escape my eyes.

1200
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,420
Qiong Zhi.

1201
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,420
You must have looked

1202
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,420
for a room.

1203
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,420
Do you want to listen

1204
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,420
to music or drink?

1205
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,420
Some guests play big games.

1206
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,420
I am not a lady.

1207
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,420
I am not a lady.

1208
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,420
I am not a lady.

1209
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,420
I am not a lady.

1210
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,420
I am not a lady.

1211
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,420
I am not a lady.

1212
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,420
Some guests play big games.

1213
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,420
They will do that.

1214
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,420
Eunuch Su,

1215
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,420
do you really believe

1216
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,420
that Little Red Riding Hood

1217
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,420
will give you information?

1218
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,420
Since you know Little Red Riding Hood,

1219
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,420
I will not regret it.

1220
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,420
I came to find Qiong Zhi.

1221
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,420
I have something to ask you.

1222
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,420
What?

1223
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,420
I know your lover.

1224
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,420
Maybe

1225
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,420
I know your lover.

1226
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,420
I don't even know

1227
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,420
that I have a lover.

1228
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,420
The son of Huai Xiang County Magistrate.

1229
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,420
Xue Zhao.

1230
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,420
Can this hand

1231
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:49,420
go through the snow?

1232
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,420
In the cold wind,

1233
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,420
in the long night,

1234
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:05,420
I embrace the warmth of the spring.

1235
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,420
The sea is deep,

1236
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:12,420
but it is not firm.

1237
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,420
Can it bury

1238
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:19,420
the regret of yesterday?

1239
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,420
Love is to

1240
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,420
cherish with life.

1241
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,420
To live on,

1242
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:34,420
even if it is a little hurtful.

1243
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:38,420
No matter sorrow or joy,

1244
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:42,420
I believe you.

1245
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:48,420
I'd rather be trapped in the coldness of the world.

1246
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,420
To live on,

1247
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:56,420
I need to use up all my courage.

1248
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,420
To love,

1249
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,420
to love,

1250
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:04,420
to know that you are breathing.

1251
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:08,420
To cross the river of life,

1252
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:12,420
just to meet you.

1253
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,420
After the separation,

1254
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:19,420
we will not be apart.

1255
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,420
After the separation,

1256
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:27,420
we will not be apart.
