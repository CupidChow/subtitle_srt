1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly stop the suffering of my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When the spring color is still the same

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Moon and the Rain

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Madam.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What's going on?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Where's Li'er?

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The second wife

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
brought the people in the mansion to the mansion

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
She said she wouldn't come back.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well...

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Or I'll go personally

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No need

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Those people are all brought back by Li'er

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Although they are the villagers

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But they have all been killed

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Such an important occasion

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
She should be here

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Madam

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Today

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is a special gift for Li'er

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Sister-in-law

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't think there's anything

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The child is big

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
She's not out there

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What kind of growth is this?

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I think Li'er's mood

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
is just like my brother

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Indeed

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If she didn't have this kind of mood

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm afraid it would be hard to achieve

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes, it is

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Madam

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's eat

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Our family

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
hasn't had such a good meal for a long time

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Come on, eat

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Come on, Li'er

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's eat together

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Brother San

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's really delicious

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Come on

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Good wine

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Come on, come on

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Come on, come on

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Come on, come on

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Come on, come on

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Uncle Liu, let's go in

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Come on, come on

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Madam

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You are Zhu Jun

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Please come over

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You eat first

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll be back soon

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll be back soon

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's well-done

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's well-done

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is it just a piece of it?

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The Ye family is rich

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And they don't even let people eat it

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Did you give me the chance to eat it?

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Isn't it the same thing here?

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You have a cat's smoke on your head?

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm not in the mood to joke with you

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then why did you ask me to come?

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Are you angry?

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why didn't you invite me to the celebration?

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What do you think?

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You are a Duke of Su

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Ye Shijie doesn't dare to think

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
that she has such a big face

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Am I going to tell you this?

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let me ask you

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Who is the person you should thank the most for your warning?

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It must be Duke of Su

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You are so kind and kind

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I really appreciate you

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Whether it's the minefield

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
to save the official business

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
or helping the refugees in Dingzhou

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
or the daughter you helped me find

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and the princess

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
or the grave of the Qingcheng Mountain

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
you woke me up

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can't do this to you

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
without you

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Thank you for your help

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Duke of Su, do you know where the wife of the Si Tu is?

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I've been looking for her

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and she's gone

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
How could you fight with her

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and get her away?

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You really are a good girl

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I asked you how you would leave

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and come to me

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It turns out you still have a plan

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I really appreciate Duke of Su

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
but the situation in the county

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
is not as good as it seems

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
but the situation in the county

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
is not as good as it seems

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The imperial doctors are all right

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's why I remembered the wife of the Si Tu

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This wine is really good

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Have a drink

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Madam Jia

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Please

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Duke of Su, if you have the wife of the Si Tu

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and you want to tell me

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I will definitely remember this favor

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You look quite handsome

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Father

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You often told me

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
that the evidence of the person's actions

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
is the man's style

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The style can be the world

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The style can be the world

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The style can be the world

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If you have the evil thoughts

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
you will be punished by others

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But why does the reality treat you like this?

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why don't good people like you

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
have a good report?

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Li

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Father

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm here

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Father

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Those who hurt us

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
are still in the world

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm very close to them

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Very close

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
God

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
will stand by us

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Cousin

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Why are you looking for me?

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Nothing

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I just want to ask

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
why Duke of Su just called you

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I just lost some of my affairs

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What do you mean?

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Where did you come from?

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Cousin

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I said I lost my affairs

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Li

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I know you are very considerate

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and don't like to be in a daze

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But I want to ask you more

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Duke of Su didn't bully you

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I've never seen this person

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
quarreling with anyone in the imperial court

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He is so close to you

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Do you have any family?

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Duke of Su helped me

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I have a feeling

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You have a feeling

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I will ask you to come to the county of Xue

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I will come back when I have time

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You can rest assured

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Jiang Li is very considerate

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Everyone in the house is talking to him

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How can I talk to him?

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Madam

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't be too worried

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
As long as he treats Jiang Li like a family

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
we will deal with him

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He has been silent and unresolved

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He is not treated well

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No one can support him

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's hard to deal with him

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But now

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
he is in the top of the famous family

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and he is out of the top

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Ye family is in the top

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He went back to Lu Yang

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and he is in the top

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He is so clear

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He even wants to take care of me

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He said he would never

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
kick Jiang family out

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm afraid he will have no chance

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What should we do?

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We have to be patient

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
when we find a chance

198
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
By the way

199
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Princess's Mansion

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
has a letter

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What did she ask you to do?

202
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This letter is for you

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I wonder what you want

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to do today

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Madam Jiang

206
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Do you think Jiang Li

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
is Jiang Li?

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Old Madam and Madam

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
are right

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Then Madam Jiang

211
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
will recognize this daughter

212
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Then I will take the picture of my family

213
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and your family

214
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
to consider

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The daughter of the family

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
is not good

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
She is the father and mother

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But Jiang Li is not with me

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and she is not my real wife

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Of course she is a little bit stubborn

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to take care of her

222
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Now

223
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
if you want to blame her

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
you can only make her

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
understand

226
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Madam Jiang

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
is a stepmother

228
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
She must have a lot of grievances

229
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But I will help you

230
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
After all, she is the daughter of the family

231
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If you don't take good care of her

232
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
you will be in great pain

233
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You will be in great pain

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If you are willing to teach me

235
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I will be grateful

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Before

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
there was a ghost in the palace

238
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Some people

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
were so cruel

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and were so cruel

241
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Later

242
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
the Tai Bu Ling

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
was punished

244
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and found that there was a concubine

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
who was killed by the evil

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
His Majesty was killed by this person

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and ended up in the palace

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You think Jiang Li

249
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
was also killed by the evil

250
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
by the evil

251
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I heard what you said

252
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I feel strange

253
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't know

254
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
the elderly in the family

255
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
all think that Jiang Li

256
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
is like a human

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
after she came back from the Zhengyu Hall

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Now think about it

259
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
the way the chief princess said

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and not to mention the other

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
since Jiang Li came back

262
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
the girl in our three rooms

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
was originally very strong

264
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Now it's like she's married

265
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I understand

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
the grievance of your wife

267
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The He family is not a good idea

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I told the Tai Bu Ling

269
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
about the Jiang family

270
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
She is happy to be in the palace

271
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and willing to marry Jiang Jia

272
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
but she is not willing to marry

273
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
but she is not willing to marry

274
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
after all

275
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
she has to agree with

276
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
the country and the wife

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
How can she be as good as them

278
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
for the wife of Jiang

279
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
is not difficult

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
After all, this is good for the Jiang family

281
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Thank you for your advice

282
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Have tea

283
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Let's drink

284
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What's the matter

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Da Milong

286
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
you scared me

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
you're the same!

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What's the matter

289
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hua Niu

290
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and Jing Xia

291
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
these two

292
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,000
how about the Void

293
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,240
here

294
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,680
P Gaza,

295
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,200
now

296
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,520
I take your place.

297
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,840
Empress,

298
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,320
please allow me to make a appearance.

299
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,360
Then,

300
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,720
welcome in.

301
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,160
Human's victory

302
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,520
Start the action

303
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,720
Yes

304
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:35,220
Super Task of Spiritualelines

305
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,220
The King of the World

306
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,220
Episode 1

307
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
The King of the World

308
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,220
The King of the World

309
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,220
The King of the World

310
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
The King of the World

311
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,220
How long has it been?

312
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,220
Last night, it happened.

313
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,220
The cause of the fire was still unknown.

314
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
The citizens of the past

315
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,220
were poisoned by the whole process.

316
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,220
It's said that the scene is quite strange.

317
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,220
What about the other people who killed the King?

318
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,220
No. Only the three of them.

319
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Sit down.

320
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,220
Yes.

321
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,220
It should be related to the Princess of the Zhan Palace.

322
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,220
The King of the World

323
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
was the King of the World.

324
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,220
He found an excuse to take her with him.

325
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,220
The Princess of the Ning Palace was imprisoned.

326
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,220
The King of the World

327
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,220
was imprisoned in the capital.

328
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,220
The inside of the cell should be replaced by Li.

329
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,220
That's right.

330
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,220
It's not a witness.

331
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,220
Master.

332
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,220
The corpse and the coroner have been brought back.

333
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,220
We need to find out the exact situation in a short time.

334
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,220
It must be someone who has a intention.

335
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,220
Take a quick look at the truth.

336
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,220
It's a trick.

337
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,220
Yes.

338
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,220
Someone is going to be in trouble.

339
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,220
It seems that the capital is going to be in trouble.

340
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,220
Master,

341
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,220
I need to give the second wife a message.

342
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,220
Let her go out of the cell.

343
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,220
Qicheng.

344
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,220
Master, do you want me to go or not?

345
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,220
If you don't want me to go,

346
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,220
I'll have you go back to the capital.

347
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,220
That's right.

348
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,220
I think the master is still angry with the second wife.

349
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,220
Even if he's worried,

350
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,220
he can't be frank.

351
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,420
Help him represent the capital,

352
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,220
edict.

353
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
Let's go out.

354
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,220
Ladies.

355
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,220
Erמow.

356
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,220
Miss க picking the todo.

357
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,220
Sister.

358
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,220
It's a rumor from the palace.

359
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,300
Now, the main emperor and the old madam are all like the elder sister.

360
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,340
You didn't come back before the wedding.

361
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,300
Ji Shuren wanted to make trouble with it and punish you.

362
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,100
I didn't expect the main emperor and the old madam would talk to the elder sister.

363
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,660
In the hall,

364
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,820
the eldest princess asked her to open the coffin for the

365
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,060
and she refused and blocked it for me.

366
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,780
Now, she should not be chasing after my identity for now.

367
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,100
But my identity is already in her heart.

368
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,860
For Ji Shuren,

369
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,060
she is now a good opportunity for me.

370
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,620
But the eldest princess doesn't dare to do anything to us.

371
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,940
We are not afraid of them.

372
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,980
The eldest princess has already killed me.

373
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,820
Although she escaped a year,

374
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,180
she will not give up.

375
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,220
Even if she is now banned,

376
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,180
I'm afraid she will try to help me and my brother.

377
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,900
Tong Er,

378
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,940
the situation now

379
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,460
can be said to be a wolf with money and tiger with back.

380
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,820
Are you afraid?

381
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,180
Sister, I'm not afraid.

382
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,900
I've been not afraid long ago.

383
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,020
I feel like I'm getting bigger and bigger now.

384
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,860
I'm not just not afraid, I'm also excited.

385
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,140
Even if I can't make it to the end,

386
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,700
I want to go a little further ahead.

387
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,900
I want to see more of those ugly people being punished.

388
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,100
I feel so tired.

389
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,500
We will definitely make it to the end.

390
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,940
Is Madam here?

391
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,380
Come to pick me up after an hour.

392
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,940
Yes.

393
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,720
Your Majesty,

394
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,580
I will take matters under control.

395
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,820
Redkawlich?

396
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,220
I lowered the guard for servants.

397
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,620
I will listen to your order right now.

398
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,420
Try once more.

399
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

400
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,340
No, you don't need to decide.

401
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,260
I'm alvirong.

402
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,140
You are a

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,820
broad- Yetro.

404
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,380
Why isn't Phlegen Sun here?

405
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,620
After a long time,

406
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,860
Give me some time!

407
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,220
Okay, okay!

408
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,980
Fine, okay, okay!

409
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,020
What are you doing?

410
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,340
Okay!

411
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
Superintendent Lia!

412
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,220
Lily be تکوب rear minima

413
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:45,820
Don't.

414
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,620
Don't.

415
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,580
Dad.

416
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:52,980
Dad.

417
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,580
Don't hit me.

418
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,780
Don't hit me.

419
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,580
Mrs. Jiang.

420
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,380
You're here.

421
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,820
I came to you

422
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,620
to find the instruction of Princess Yuzhan.

423
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,620
I think you're interested in that painting.

424
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,220
I'm not interested in that painting.

425
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,420
But the painting

426
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,820
is very similar to the one I painted before.

427
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,820
It's very similar.

428
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,820
Do you have any connection

429
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,820
with that painting?

430
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,820
It's because of the accident.

431
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,820
It's a accident.

432
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,220
It's a accident.

433
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,820
It's a human.

434
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,820
What do you mean?

435
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,620
You're Liu Wenzi?

436
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,420
No way.

437
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,420
No way.

438
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,820
You thought you'd let go of that fire?

439
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,620
I'll leave this world to this, right?

440
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
You're not a person.

441
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,020
You're a person.

442
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,820
You're a person.

443
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,820
You're a person.

444
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,820
You're a person.

445
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,820
You're a person.

446
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,420
You're a person.

447
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,620
You're a person.

448
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,020
You're a person.

449
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,020
I'm a person.

450
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,020
You're a person.

451
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,020
You're a person.

452
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,220
You're a person.

You're a person.

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,420
You're a person.

455
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,620
You're a person.

456
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,820
You're a person.

457
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,020
You're a person.

458
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,020
You're a person.

00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,220
You're a person.

460
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,220
You're a person.

461
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,220
You're a person.

462
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,220
You're a person.

463
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,220
You're a person.

464
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,220
You're a person.

465
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,220
You're a person.

466
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,220
You're a person.

467
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,220
You're a person.

468
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,220
You're a person.

469
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,220
You're a person.

470
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,220
You're a person.

471
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,220
You're a person.

472
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,220
You're a person.

473
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,220
You're a person.

474
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,220
You're a person.

475
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,220
You're a person.

476
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,220
You're a person.

477
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,220
You're a person.

478
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,220
You're a person.

479
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,420
You're a person.

480
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,620
You're a person.

481
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,820
You're a person.

482
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,420
You're a person.

483
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,420
You're a person.

484
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,820
You're a person.

485
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,020
Wencai,

486
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,820
are you still drawing me?

487
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,820
I can only use my left hand.

488
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,220
How did you come here?

489
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,340
I used all the savings

490
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,780
to open a small shop in my hometown.

491
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,300
I made paintings and sold them.

492
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,940
I thought it was a blind date.

493
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,380
But there was a sign.

494
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,100
I didn't expect them to see me in a blind date.

495
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,500
I was humiliated.

496
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,340
Until someone wanted to tear you apart,

497
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,460
I fought with my life

498
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,180
and hurt him with anger.

499
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,740
I was humiliated and locked up.

500
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,020
I couldn't stay here anymore.

501
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,300
I only wanted to bring the paintings to the capital.

502
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,340
Since you know I've become a wife of the Jiang family,

503
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,300
you shouldn't come to me again.

504
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,180
I thought you wouldn't come.

505
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,420
But you came.

506
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,300
I'm sorry.

507
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,300
I'm sorry.

508
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
I'm sorry.

509
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
I'm sorry.

510
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
I'm sorry.

511
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,300
I'm sorry.

512
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
I'm sorry.

513
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
I'm sorry.

514
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,300
I'm sorry.

515
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,300
I'm sorry.

516
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,300
I'm sorry.

517
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,300
I'm sorry.

518
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
I'm sorry.

519
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
I'm sorry.

520
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
I'm sorry.

521
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,180
I'm sorry.

522
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,180
Uncle.

523
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,380
Uncle.

524
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
You're going to kill me?

525
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,500
You shouldn't have come to me again.

526
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,300
I don't see you anymore.

527
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,380
Uncle.

528
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,180
Uncle.

529
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,180
Uncle.

530
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,180
Uncle.

531
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,180
Uncle.

532
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,180
Uncle, come back.

533
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
Uncle.

534
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,180
Come back.

535
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,180
Uncle.

536
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,180
Uncle.

537
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
Uncle.

538
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,180
Uncle.

539
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,180
Let me go.

540
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
Let me go.

541
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,180
Look at me.

542
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,180
Look at me.

543
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,180
I didn't have the face

544
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,180
to protect me

545
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,180
in that big fire.

546
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,180
I thought

547
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,180
if I could live with my heart,

548
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,180
I wouldn't let you know that I'm here.

549
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,180
But it's good that

550
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,180
if you didn't want to kill me,

551
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,180
I wouldn't have the chance like this.

552
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,180
You went to the Princess of Zhang

553
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,180
and told her about Jiang Jia's blood.

554
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,180
You want to revenge me.

555
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
I said I wanted to revenge you.

556
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,180
I won't wait until today.

557
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,180
All these years,

558
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,180
why are you here now?

559
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,180
You've been through a lot.

560
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,180
Even if I find you,

561
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,180
I can't let you do anything for me.

562
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,180
But now,

563
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,180
you finally saved me.

564
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,180
I can give you a chance

565
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,180
to see if you're willing to do it.

566
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,180
Madam, you're back.

567
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Madam.

568
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,180
What's wrong?

569
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
I'm fine.

570
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
I want to go in.

571
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
Please.

572
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,180
You...

573
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,180
Go to rest.

574
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,180
Madam.

575
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,180
I don't have time to go.

576
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
Go.

577
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,180
Madam.

578
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,180
Let's go.

579
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
Madam.

580
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,180
Madam.

581
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
Didn't Mr. Zhou come?

582
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,180
No.

583
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,180
He was so pleased.

584
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,180
Father didn't come to see his mother

585
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,180
because he didn't want to be favored by him.

586
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,180
Has he sent anything recently?

587
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,180
Mr. Zhou has sent a while ago.

588
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,180
He was stopped by Madam Su.

589
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,180
He didn't reply to her

590
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,180
and didn't send anything.

591
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,180
Yes.

592
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,180
Madam Su is very interesting.

593
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,180
Come back when you're back.

594
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,180
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

595
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,180
Madam.

596
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,180
Did Mr. Zhou

597
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,180
send anything to Ruo Yao?

598
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,180
Yes.

599
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,180
I'm guarding the Yan's room.

600
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,180
Let Mr. Qi

601
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,180
come to the room to get the news.

602
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,180
If Ruo Yao continues to fight with Zhu Yanbang,

603
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,180
something will happen sooner or later.

604
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,180
Madam.

605
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,180
You look so pale.

606
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,180
It's okay.

607
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,180
You're too pale.

608
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,180
Don't be so violent.

609
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,180
I'm fine.

610
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,180
What a girl.

611
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,180
She's so happy.

612
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,180
She's brought so many things.

613
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,180
Take it back.

614
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,180
Put it here.

615
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,180
Open it.

616
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,180
Put it next to it.

617
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,180
Isn't the gift you brought back

618
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,180
the price you brought?

619
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,180
I took it wrongly.

620
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,180
My daughter got a lot of money

621
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,180
from the Zhou family.

622
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,180
Mother, you take it first.

623
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,180
I'll bring it back next time.

624
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,180
Yu'er.

625
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,180
The Zhou family really treat you well.

626
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,180
They didn't take you with them.

627
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,180
Mother, don't worry.

628
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,180
I'm doing well.

629
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,180
I'm willing to take care of you.

630
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,180
I'll do it again.

631
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,180
I'll forgive you.

632
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,180
If the family gives you a face,

633
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,180
how much will you be?

634
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,180
What's wrong?

635
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,180
Nothing.

636
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,180
Show me.

637
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,180
Show me.

638
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,180
What's wrong?

639
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,180
It's nothing.

640
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,180
My daughter fell down.

641
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,180
Where did she fall down?

642
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,180
Mother, don't be angry.

643
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,180
Zhou Yubeng, she hit you.

644
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,180
Father,

645
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,180
I'll go back to the family tomorrow.

646
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,180
Can you do it?

647
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,180
Shut up!

648
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,180
I said

649
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
I don't want to see you.

650
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,180
What's wrong?

651
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,180
You're not awake.

652
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Jiang Li.

653
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,180
Jiang Li is back.

654
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,180
Yes.

655
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,180
Jiang Li is back.

656
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Jiang Li is back.

657
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,180
Jiang Li is back.

658
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,180
None of your business.

659
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Jiang Ruoyao is not enough.

660
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,180
Don't tell me you still want Jiang Li?

661
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,180
Get lost!

662
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,180
If you didn't climb on my bed that night,

663
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,180
Jiang Li and I wouldn't be here today.

664
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,180
You're a bitch.

665
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,180
What do you think Jiang Li is?

666
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,180
The note you gave Jiang Li

667
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,180
was given to me by him.

668
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
You think he's loyal to you

669
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
and dreaming.

670
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,180
That's just your wishful thinking.

671
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,180
What do you mean?

672
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,180
What's going on?

673
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,180
You've made up your mind!

674
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,180
He asked me to go find you.

675
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,180
I kept telling you

676
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,180
that my sister Qingzi

677
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,180
is not loyal to you.

678
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,180
That's why I pushed you there.

679
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,180
Good for you, Jiang Li.

680
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,180
As long as I'm pregnant with his child,

681
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,180
I'll be able to get a baby.

682
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,180
At that time,

683
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,180
I'll be the mother of the Zhou family.

684
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,180
Everything will be fine.

685
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,180
Madam,

686
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,180
that Mr. Zhou is not good to Jiang Yu'e.

687
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,180
Those notes

688
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,180
were not given by the Zhou family.

689
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,180
It's the price of Jiang Yu'e's own day.

690
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
I knew it.

691
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,180
He wouldn't like Jiang Yu'e.

692
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,180
That Mr. Zhou

693
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,180
seems to have mentioned the second madam.

694
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,180
And Jiang Yu'e also said that

695
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,180
Mr. Zhou wanted to cancel the second madam's...

696
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,180
That's impossible!

697
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,180
He must still have me in his heart.

698
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,180
Madam.

699
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,180
Leave now.

700
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,180
Yes.

701
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,180
Yan'er,

702
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,180
I've arranged the marriage of the Qi family.

703
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,180
I'll help you.

704
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,180
You can meet

705
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,180
Mr. Qi's cousin.

706
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,180
He should be far away from you.

707
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,180
Did you hear me?

708
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,180
Yes.

709
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,180
Do you know

710
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
how many people

711
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,180
I've been looking for

712
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,180
in your family recently?

713
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
You just got married.

714
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,180
You're not well.

715
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,180
If you want to find another good family,

716
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,180
it's not easy.

717
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,180
The Qi family is a high-ranking family.

718
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,180
The child is also a good cook.

719
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,180
You should be kind.

720
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,180
Go and change your clothes.

721
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,180
I'm too tired today.

722
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,180
I'll change it.

723
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,180
What's wrong with you recently?

724
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,180
You're not well dressed.

725
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,180
You're not good at drinking.

726
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,180
You look like you're dying.

727
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,180
I really can't go today.

728
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,180
I'm so tired.

729
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,180
If you don't go today,

730
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,180
you'll have to go in a few days.

731
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,180
Anyway,

732
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,180
you must go.

733
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,180
Is it important?

734
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,180
I've already decided.

735
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
What's this?

736
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,180
Mother.

737
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,180
Mother, what are you doing?

738
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,180
Mother.

739
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,180
Mother.

740
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,180
Mother.

741
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,180
Mother.

742
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,180
The earth is long and there is time.

743
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,180
This hatred is endless.

744
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,180
You're even in the back.

745
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,180
You still have contact with Zhou Yambang.

746
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,180
It's none of your business.

747
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,180
Mother.

748
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,180
Yes.

749
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,180
Go and bring the new clothes to Ruo Yao.

750
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:23,180
You must go to see the next Qi.

751
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,180
Mother.

752
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,180
Mother.

753
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,180
If you don't listen to me this time,

754
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,180
I'll think I've never seen you before.

755
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,180
Second Sister.

756
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,180
Fourth Sister.

757
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,180
It's been a long time.

758
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
I haven't come here

759
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,180
to thank you.

760
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,180
I'm flattered.

761
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,180
I'm not a good person.

762
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,180
Why are you a good person?

763
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,180
Without Second Sister,

764
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,180
I can't even see the big door of the Zhou family.

765
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,180
If I become the wife of Mrs. Zhou

766
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,180
sitting in the hall,

767
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,180
I'll come back to thank you.

768
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
I'm back.

769
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,180
Fourth Sister.

770
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,180
You don't care about me?

771
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,180
Little Rui Rui.

772
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,180
I'm back.

773
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,180
I'm back.

774
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,180
Listen to me.

775
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,180
Ding Zhou's family is already good.

776
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,180
Liu Xun and her father are behind there.

777
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,180
We're going to be a family.

778
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,180
I'm coming back.

779
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,180
I heard that

780
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,180
your business is a big deal.

781
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,180
I'm not here for such a wonderful thing.

782
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,180
What a pity.

783
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,180
If you really want to watch the show,

784
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
you won't go to Ding Zhou.

785
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,180
What are you talking about?

786
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,180
How is that possible?

787
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,180
You suddenly came back.

788
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,180
You must be angry because of Liu Xun.

789
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
You were rushed back.

790
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,180
What are you talking about?

791
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,180
How is that possible?

792
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,180
Am I that kind of person?

793
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,180
Impossible.

794
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,180
Of course, you're that kind of person.

795
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
Did Liu Xun and Xie Xie

796
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,180
say something to you?

797
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,180
Tell me.

798
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,180
Tell me.

799
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,180
Little Rui Rui.

800
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,180
Do you understand?

801
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,180
Men and women are not close.

802
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,180
Tell me.

803
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,180
I won't.

804
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,180
I won't.

805
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,180
Stop it.

806
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,180
Tell me.

807
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,180
Why can't I even

808
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,180
be the one who I am pretending to be?

809
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,180
Lady.

810
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,180
Mr. Zhou's letter.

811
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
How could he...

812
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,180
I'm in trouble today.

813
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,180
I want to ask for your opinion.

814
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,180
Lady, you're impulsive.

815
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,180
You're really trying to

816
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,180
make a fuss about Mr. Qi and you.

817
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,180
If you find out about this,

818
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,180
I'll definitely tell you.

819
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,180
If you find out about this,

820
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,180
no matter what,

821
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,180
Mr. Zhou has been

822
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,180
sending me letters for days.

823
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,180
He suddenly came to me

824
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
and didn't come to the door.

825
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,180
He was trying to lure me out.

826
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,180
You don't understand.

827
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,180
He's been in my mind all the time.

828
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,180
Lady.

829
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,180
Have you ever

830
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,180
touched anything in my box?

831
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,180
No.

832
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
Someone came today.

833
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,180
Mrs. Sun came to send these new clothes.

834
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,180
She said that she wanted to

835
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,180
make a special meeting

836
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,180
for the third lady

837
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,180
and her husband.

838
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,180
She asked me to take care of it.

839
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,180
She even ordered me

840
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,180
to think about the meeting.

841
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,180
I was so worried.

842
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,180
It's my mother.

843
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,180
She took my purse.

844
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,180
My lady.

845
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,180
My lady.

846
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,180
Do you think you can

847
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,180
make me lose my mind

848
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,180
and make me die?

849
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,180
Stop thinking.

850
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,180
My lady.

851
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,180
I saw that you went to find Jiang Ruoyao.

852
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,180
My lady.

853
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,180
It's a big deal.

854
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,180
It's not good for anyone.

855
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,180
Besides, you said

856
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,180
he was sleeping in the study.

857
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,180
I see.

858
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,180
You may leave.

859
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,180
I should go to bed.

860
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
Yes.

861
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,180
My lady.

862
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,180
My lady.

863
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,180
I've asked

864
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
the real man of Rui Xiang Ji

865
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,180
to make you a dress.

866
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180
Or

867
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,180
I can ask the tailor

868
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,180
to stay at home

869
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,180
to avoid the trouble.

870
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,180
I specially made this for you.

871
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,180
Come on.

872
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,180
Have another one.

873
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,180
It's a pig.

874
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,180
You gave me so much.

875
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,180
My lady, where are you going?

876
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,180
Leave me alone.

877
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,180
I know

878
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,180
what happened last night.

879
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,180
What did you say?

880
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
Why don't I ask you

881
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,180
what you want to do?

882
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,180
You don't want to

883
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,180
let me have a good relationship with you.

884
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,180
Why do you want to

885
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,180
find that Jiang Ruo Yao

886
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,180
and have a good life

887
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,180
with me?

888
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,180
You dare to follow me?

889
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,180
I'm warning you.

890
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,180
Don't tell me

891
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,180
what happened last night.

892
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,180
Or I won't spare you.

893
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,180
My lady.

894
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,180
My lady.

895
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,180
Are you really going to

896
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,180
give the tailor a treat

897
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,180
by yourself?

898
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,180
It's good to be a tailor.

899
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,180
By the way,

900
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,180
I have something to tell you.

901
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,180
Jiang Ruo Yao

902
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,180
went to Xiang Qing today.

903
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,180
She went to the funeral

904
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,180
and came back.

905
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,180
It seems that the tailor

906
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,180
was not happy.

907
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,180
The technician

908
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,180
went to her yard

909
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,180
and didn't come out for hours.

910
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,180
She must be in a coma.

911
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,180
I didn't expect

912
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,180
Jiang Ruo Yao is so...

913
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,180
So...

914
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,180
Yuchun.

915
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,180
What are you talking about?

916
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,180
It's common for her

917
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,180
to be brainwashed by love.

918
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,180
It's Yuchun

919
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,180
who doesn't deserve it.

920
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,180
But Jiang Ruo Yao

921
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,180
is really pitiful.

922
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,180
According to the character of the tailor,

923
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,180
even if the tailor is not good today,

924
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,180
but tomorrow

925
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,180
there will be the Zhang family, the Wang family,

926
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,180
and the people who don't know how to resist.

927
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,180
They can't blame others.

928
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,180
You think they are like you?

929
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,180
They are all the same.

930
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,180
But it's okay.

931
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,180
They are busy.

932
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,180
They don't have time

933
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,180
to trouble you.

934
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,180
The five-seater is already finished.

935
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,180
They haven't found the place.

936
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,180
The fire is not clear yet.

937
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,180
The country is full of clouds.

938
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,180
The battle is at the place of the dead king.

939
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,180
The horse is written in the year of the horse.

940
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,180
The spirit is the land.

941
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,180
The grass is as clear as the road.

942
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,180
It's hard to see.

943
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,180
The new man has a master.

944
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,180
He has light on his body.

945
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,180
The wood and the broken body

946
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,180
of the Fuxiu are all possible.

947
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,180
It's like a fire.

948
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,180
The so-called will

949
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,180
is just a person pretending to be a ghost.

950
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,180
So it is.

951
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,180
The fire is a person's threat.

952
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,180
The person who was burned to death

953
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,180
should be also pointed by the person.

954
