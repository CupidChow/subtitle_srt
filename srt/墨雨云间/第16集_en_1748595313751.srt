1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I think of this cry

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm in my heart

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't know

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm slowly holding on to this life's pain

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Waiting to leave when spring comes

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I helped him know

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can do that

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Jiang Li

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
reunite with his master

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
She even unwilling to take advantage of Jeie's identity

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm afraid there will be a risk of being exposed to the night.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Mr. Li,

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the good news is still in the back.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Who do you think you are?

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Can't we be fooled by him?

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What's wrong with you?

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's wrong with you?

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The court is in charge of the execution of the officials.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's a crime.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Good.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Today, the county guard is at the scene.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He should be the law.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Zhu Jianwei,

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
you tell me what I'm saying.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Really?

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're the general's wife.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why can't you be the general's wife?

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The general is a good man.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Close the case.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't be angry.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Close the case.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Close the case.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Close the case.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're kidding.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The general is not polite to his own daughter.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I was sent to the town

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
for ten years.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
To prove my innocence,

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
my father's wife is polite.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll keep it a secret.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You tell me.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Say it again.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Father,

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the night is a marriage between the governor and the governor.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Our night is so complicated.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You don't know how to do it.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The daughter of the night is in the general's house.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They were put in the town for ten years.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
They have been here for a long time.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Do you think the general will care about the night?

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Madam Jiang,

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the night's share of the family is indeed problematic.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If you insist on getting married,

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
you should make a point.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Otherwise, you can't escape from it.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Everyone says that the share of the family is dead.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I dare to ask you.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is there a problem with the share of the family?

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Where did you hear it from?

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The whole city is talking about it.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The whole Luyang knows it now.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The night's share of the family is also taken away by the husband and wife.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's right.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's not a mistake.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When did the case get to be done?

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I only heard Yan say it.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't have any evidence.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Of course we have evidence.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The share of the family is kept in the house.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's why we came to the night's share of the family.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Did the king's death cause any investigation?

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What's the problem with the share of the family?

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There's a search warrant.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Since you said there's a search warrant,

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
there's no evidence.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If we don't get the evidence,

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
will Luyang's case be so bad?

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Madam Jiang, you're right.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Luyang has a case.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The share of the family can be handled directly.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The share of the family is cancelled.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I came from the capital.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Many officials in the capital are in the city.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If you say the share of the family will be cancelled,

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
it's not a coincidence.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think Luyang's share of the family is not a problem.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The share of the family is also a problem.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If the officials in the city

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
really get the share of the family,

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
how big a wave of waves would it be?

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Such a big thing

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
is the life and death of the whole people.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The urgent matter is

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
we should find out

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
the share of the family.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What's the problem?

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How can we find out

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
the share of the family?

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm not going to help you.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The owner of the family is in jail.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Everyone in Li Zheng Hall

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
doesn't know about it.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Moreover,

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
the guard just said

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the witness is in the yard.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Li Ying, the lawyer,

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
wrote the article and sent it to the capital.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The lawyer will send officials

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
to Luyang to find out the share of the family.

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What about the share of the family?

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He can be arrested with the person in the house,

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
but he doesn't mention the share of the family.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I think he wants to cover up the family.

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why doesn't the share of the family

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
ask the share of the family to investigate?

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes.

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What's the problem?

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The black and white of Jiang Er's article

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
is really a test of the official position.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How can it be black and white?

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Mr. Li,

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
look at his method of taking the family.

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He's very familiar with it.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Zhu Xianwei,

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
please tell Tong Fuyin that

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've already written the letter

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and named it my father.

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
My father will personally

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
find the share of the family to help the investigation.

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
In a few days,

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the people of the share of the family will come to Luyang.

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
By then,

141
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
the share of the family will be solved.

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Of course, the share of the family will be revealed.

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't worry.

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
My second uncle is still being arrested.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The family is not allowed to run away.

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Zhu Xianwei,

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I understand.

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If you insist on taking the family,

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
you will be punished.

150
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Retreat.

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What's going on?

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's going on?

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What's going on?

154
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've come up with a solution.

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I might need some money.

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What?

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Everyone,

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
the share of the family

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that you bought

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
can be taken back and leave as evidence.

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Besides the original price and the return,

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
there will be extra compensation for everyone.

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's so small.

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's so small.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's so small.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You can take all the money

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
in the store.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If it's not enough,

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
send someone to get it back.

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You can make a registration for everyone.

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes.

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Everyone,

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
if someone wants to withdraw now,

174
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
then this way, please.

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This way, please.

176
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This way, please.

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Come on.

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
One by one.

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What a good show.

180
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The previous show was not good.

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The latter shot a high-end shot.

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's also a good match for Mr. Li.

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Mr. Li,

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
what do you think?

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
A little girl

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
has such a great ability.

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
She's so interesting.

188
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I just don't know

189
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
if the Prime Minister of the capital

190
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
will blame her

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
for what she did.

192
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If the Prime Minister knows

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that this is Mr. Li's arm,

194
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
then he will be in a good mood

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
for his daughter

196
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
as she is now.

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Chief,

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
what Li Jin Shuo said just now

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
is reasonable.

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Jiang Li moved out of Jiang Yuan Bay.

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Is he not fat?

202
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He is moving out of Jiang Yuan Bay.

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Because Jiang Yuan Bay is the prime minister,

204
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Tong Zhiyang will remember it.

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Tong Zhiyang is behind Li's family.

207
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He wants to see

208
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Jiang's family and Li's family

209
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
to make up a plan

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and not stay in the same place.

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Why?

212
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Because he wants to see

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the whole country

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and the whole country

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
be together.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Why?

217
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's see what he wants.

218
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Come on.

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Drink some water.

220
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's go.

221
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
She's found out.

222
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It seems that our second wife

223
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
is still angry.

224
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Wenji,

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
go back to the palace.

226
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I think

227
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
the second wife

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
seems to be

229
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
not very good at building.

230
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Go tell Jiang Erniang

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
that I just drank Li's son

232
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and a good tea.

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes.

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Did Li Jin find

235
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
the place where we watched the play today?

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Or did you find it in the Palace of Duke Su?

237
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Is there any difference?

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes.

239
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If Li Jin found it,

240
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I will act

241
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
in the play today.

242
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But if you find it...

243
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Are you sure?

244
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm not sure.

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
After watching the play,

246
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
you always change me

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
in front of you.

248
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What I said

249
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
is not true

250
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
but is not true.

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But there is a cut

252
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
in the key

253
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
in the key.

254
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry

255
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
for you.

256
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And you

257
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
were the one

258
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
who made the tea house

259
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
in the Palace of Duke Su.

260
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You are not showing your cards today.

261
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Are you just watching the play?

262
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Are you mad at me?

263
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No.

264
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Then you are so nice to be scolded.

265
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You...

266
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The tea house

267
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
should be higher than the top.

268
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What is the top of the new house?

269
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Do you have to win?

270
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No.

271
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No.

272
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That day

273
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
you met

274
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
a man named Wu Lan.

275
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Wu Lan?

276
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What a nice name.

277
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He was the companion

278
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
of Xiao Tao Heng.

279
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Really?

280
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Then what does

281
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
this have to do with the Ye Family?

282
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It doesn't.

283
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I should let you know.

284
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay.

285
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I already know.

286
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Did he hear my explanation?

287
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Master, I heard it.

288
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You are not a pal.

289
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You are not a pal.

290
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Do you think my cousin is good?

291
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I have been taking care of everyone.

292
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Those pigs and dogs are so scary.

293
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
They are so shameless.

294
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They are so shameless.

295
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
They dare not to fight.

296
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Li Zhentang is the only one who can protect her.

297
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
All these things are thanks to Ah Li.

298
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Don't be so sad.

299
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I should do all these things.

300
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Don't be so sad.

301
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You are the one who did all these things.

302
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's weird.

303
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yesterday, those officials

304
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
still talked to us.

305
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Today, they are so shameless.

306
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
They even said that it's all a misunderstanding.

307
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We thought

308
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
that if we wanted to make a big show today,

309
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
we would see the real person.

310
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Today, they are like a character.

311
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They are not good at sharing.

312
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It must be because they are from the same family.

313
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
When they have a good relationship,

314
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
they suddenly change their attitude.

315
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The bad guys are afraid of destroying the future.

316
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
They are like the family of the real people.

317
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They are not as good as they are.

318
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But today's talk is just a matter of time.

319
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We can't be too careful.

320
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Ah Li,

321
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
you really have a message from your father.

322
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Is your father really able to take care of this matter?

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's too troublesome to explain this matter to my father.

324
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So, the letter was written to Ye Biao.

325
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ye Biao is now the new official of the Ministry of Revenue.

326
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
He went to Zhiran City to ask for help

327
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
to come to Lu Yang to investigate.

328
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Zhiran City will give him a few masks.

329
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
As for my father,

330
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I just moved out to Xia Hu Tong's Yang.

331
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Otherwise, they won't be able to do it easily today.

332
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Biao,

333
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
if you use your father's official name like this,

334
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
will he be upset and unhappy?

335
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
My father has been a good student for his whole life.

336
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He can't protect his family and save innocent people.

337
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What's the use of putting him there?

338
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You are too bold.

339
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You have returned to the capital by yourself.

340
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm afraid your father will blame you for this.

341
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
If this matter is done,

342
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
he will not blame me for being ruthless to my father.

343
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
As for Tong Zhiyang,

344
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
he has been afraid of being reckless recently.

345
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But the incense stick I just got is safe.

346
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The incense stick I have on me is fine.

347
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The incense stick that can be found is the one that appeared recently.

348
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Or Lu Yang did it.

349
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Now,

350
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I only hope Zhiran City can prove that the incense stick is fine.

351
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Give Ye Biao a light heart.

352
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Biao.

353
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Er Jiangmu.

354
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I believe

355
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
we can overcome this difficulty this time.

356
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
My father has always been in the same house with me.

357
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
He has been a good student for you.

358
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
He has done everything well.

359
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Today, I finally have a new opinion.

360
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's a shame.

361
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's really a shame.

362
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If it's not for this matter,

363
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I will definitely find out the truth.

364
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Father, let me tell you something.

365
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You don't have to worry about the truth.

366
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You just need to do what you want.

367
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The wealth of the Ye family

368
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
will be yours.

369
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Thank you, my lord.

370
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Thank you, my lord.

371
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I have been in the capital for a long time.

372
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So I will be able to get out of the capital.

373
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The rest of the matter

374
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
will be yours.

375
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Please don't worry, my lord.

376
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
As long as Ye Mi Xuan is in my hands,

377
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
we will be done with the wealth of the Ye family.

378
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Thank you.

379
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You are welcome.

380
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Kitchen

381
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,260
Scenic

382
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,000
Zh Bazcu, we are already in Lu Yang City.

383
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
We will gonna besten to head to town

384
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
hoping to find some guys

385
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
to bring Che What the Ye family

386
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and Lu Yang supplications?

387
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,720
The case is Montess Jean

388
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
of Jiao.

389
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Since we concern about Che

390
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,080
I take it carefully,

391
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,520
but I can't ever expose ourselves to Buddha's Life scriptures.

392
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,800
How many people

393
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,100
have theunky hands,

394
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
in order to make the tantric欸re paste,

395
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,040
such a thing?

396
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,640
Immortal God and Black Spirit came to us

397
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,160
and planned everything.

398
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,880
We should not be forced to do favors.

399
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,560
Understood?

400
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,720
Yes.

401
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Where did the man from the commandant's office come from?

402
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
He said he came from the capital of Hong Kong.

403
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He came from the town hall.

404
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let them see who the master is.

405
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And the second general came from the front door.

406
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
How many people came?

407
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Two.

408
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You are so arrogant.

409
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You come to me to scold me.

410
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I want to regret it.

411
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Master.

412
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's a long time.

413
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I will tell you in advance.

414
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I will prepare tea and serve you.

415
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I am afraid you will not let me come.

416
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's serious.

417
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
As Lu Yang's parents,

418
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I am the general of Lu Yang's people.

419
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
How can I not let you come?

420
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Besides, you are a noble person.

421
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I am sorry for my mistake.

422
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You are so close to me.

423
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I am also a good person.

424
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I am afraid you will not let me come.

425
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You want to use the position of the general to bully us.

426
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Lu Yang's parents are afraid of being oppressed.

427
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
They don't dare to be the master.

428
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What do you mean?

429
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I want to be the master.

430
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I will be in peace if I don't know the truth.

431
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I heard the private officer of Zhilan Shuxia is here.

432
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
As the master of the family,

433
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I will come to explain the situation.

434
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Miss Jiang Er, the news is good.

435
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The time is good.

436
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I think the same person is the master.

437
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I think this is Zhilan Ling.

438
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I am Tang Fan.

439
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
This is...

440
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The future of the country, Jiang Li,

441
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and Miss Jiang Er.

442
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So it's Miss Jiang Er.

443
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yes, sir.

444
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I have received a report.

445
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The record of Lu Yang's family's share of shares.

446
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Zhilan Ling, the share of the family's share

447
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
is a death sentence.

448
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You should know it.

449
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But Lu Yang City has a life sentence.

450
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I have to ask.

451
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The life sentence is not good.

452
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Zhilan Ling, please be safe.

453
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But I have to find out.

454
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The family is not in line.

455
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I think it's time to write.

456
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But Miss Jiang Er is standing here.

457
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
She wants to borrow Zhilan Shu to let us go.

458
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Zhilan Ling.

459
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What Tong Fuyin means is

460
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Zhilan Ling has the power to do things.

461
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And she can borrow people.

462
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Tong Fuyin, you are right.

463
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Ye family has never been a burden to you.

464
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But it's been more than ten days since you have been investigating.

465
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Now Ye family is in a bad mood.

466
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Wang Ren Zhi Ling is in a bad mood.

467
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Nothing is out of the picture.

468
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Zhilan Ling has been working for half a day.

469
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
She is doing her job.

470
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm afraid she will stay here for another ten days.

471
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I have to tell Tong Fuyin

472
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
about the case.

473
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I will report it to the top.

474
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Zhilan Ling is in a bad mood.

475
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But I dare not let her go easily.

476
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If Ye family's problem is really there,

477
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
she will definitely find out.

478
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Since Fuyin is in a bad mood,

479
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
will you take Zhilan Ling to another place?

480
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Will Tong Fuyin also take over Zhilan Shu's case?

481
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Of course.

482
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Zhilan Ling must investigate this case thoroughly.

483
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And give a explanation to Lu Yang Cheng's people.

484
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
As you command.

485
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Take care.

486
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yuan Lei, they don't care about me.

487
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
They just want me to be safe.

488
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Then I will send someone to keep an eye on them.

489
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
They are not well.

490
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They don't do anything.

491
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Even if they start investigating from this moment,

492
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
they will not be able to find out anything in a short time.

493
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Just wait for the picture of the capital.

494
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes.

495
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Zhilan Ling,

496
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
hurry and take the carriage to Lu Yang.

497
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I will send you to rest.

498
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Second Madam Jiang has given me the high-skilled hat

499
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
that can clean the case.

500
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I can't rest in peace.

501
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You have already seen through my thoughts.

502
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The case is not going to be disturbed.

503
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I can't help you

504
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
to make the family feel safe.

505
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This is what I am doing.

506
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I am the one who is responsible for this.

507
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Why bother to say this?

508
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
These past few days,

509
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I think Second Madam Jiang has already made some conclusions.

510
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Why don't you come over?

511
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Before, the people were wearing the traditional clothes

512
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
of the ancient incense stick.

513
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
They were already sent to the Ye family's manufacturing factory.

514
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
The things there have never been moved.

515
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It is convenient to make tea.

516
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You are from the Hang family.

517
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Ye family needs you to help us with this.

518
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
If the Ye family needs anything from the Ye family,

519
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I will help you to clear the case.

520
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Second Madam Jiang has been here.

521
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I admire her.

522
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Let's go.

523
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Let's go to the manufacturing factory.

524
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Please.

525
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Zhai Yanling.

526
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Is there a problem with these ancient incense sticks?

527
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The scent of the ancient incense sticks comes from the incense stick.

528
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It is made of solid firewood and has a lot of heat.

529
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But in the taste of the ancient incense sticks,

530
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I can only smell the incense stick.

531
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
There is also a sweet and fragrant incense stick.

532
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Sweet and fragrant?

533
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yes.

534
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I can smell the incense stick.

535
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Sweet and fragrant?

536
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Sweet and fragrant?

537
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
How come?

538
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It does have a sweet and fragrant smell.

539
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Do you know what the Ye family's incense sticks taste like?

540
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I don't know.

541
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I feel a little dizzy.

542
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Li Yu, turn off the fire.

543
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Are you okay?

544
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The fire is out of the fire.

545
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It has a smell of burnt pepper.

546
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Some of the burnt pepper is gray.

547
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It is only a little bit.

548
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
There is no problem with the original amount.

549
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
This sweet and fragrant incense stick is made of solid firewood.

550
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The incense sticks are not made of solid firewood.

551
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
What kind of incense sticks are added?

552
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It is the Tuoluo of the West.

553
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Tuoluo?

554
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Do you know?

555
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
My father has been to the north and south of the bed.

556
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I have heard from my father.

557
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Tuoluo is a kind of plant in the west.

558
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
After taking the plant,

559
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
you can use it to make acupuncture.

560
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It has a hallucination effect.

561
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But the Tuoluo that has not been removed

562
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and the poison,

563
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
it can be cured in a few days.

564
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's all broken.

565
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Lady Ye, you are so wise.

566
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I wonder why there is Tuoluo on the ancient incense stick?

567
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The incense sticks of ancient incense sticks

568
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
were made by my father.

569
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
There has never been a problem in the past years.

570
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
How can you ruin your reputation?

571
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You used the poison to harm innocent people?

572
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Lady Ye,

573
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
before the cause of the incident is investigated,

574
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm sorry.

575
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm afraid Ye family can't be removed.

576
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Tuoluo is a rare thing in the West.

577
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It has a very good environment.

578
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Other than the southern part of the West,

579
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
it can't be achieved anywhere else.

580
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So, the less the money,

581
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
the more the money,

582
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
the greater the poison.

583
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's like this.

584
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The person who poisoned the incense stick

585
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
must be worth hundreds of taels of silver.

586
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
A pair of ancient incense sticks

587
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
worth tens of taels of silver.

588
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
If we want to put the Tuoluo that is worth hundreds of taels of silver

589
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
into the ancient incense stick,

590
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
it will damage the money and life.

591
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's not what the Shang family is.

592
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Someone wanted to frame Ye family.

593
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So, they poisoned the incense stick.

594
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
We should find out

595
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
the origin of the poison.

596
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Tuoluo is not the poison of this place.

597
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
If we go into Luyang City,

598
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
we can only use the shop to buy goods.

599
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
If we investigate the businessmen who enter and exit Luyang every year,

600
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
we can find the origin.

601
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
If we find the origin of Tuoluo,

602
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
we must report it.

603
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm not a small natural rat.

604
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I understand the problem of the natural rat.

605
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But,

606
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
if the natural rat can find the first and second place,

607
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
my father will not treat you badly.

608
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Zhiyuan Liang,

609
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
don't you think you should kill Jiang Xiangguo?

610
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Do you know what is the most dangerous thing?

611
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's a trap.

612
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You are really a real man

613
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
to protect the second wife and child.

614
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Who is willing to investigate who is the real one?

615
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
As a natural rat,

616
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
we can find out the origin of Tuoluo.

617
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
As for Ye family,

618
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
or the other people who put it in,

619
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
it has nothing to do with me.

620
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
What should we do next?

621
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Do something.

622
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Then tell the second wife to do her best.

623
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But she can't do it.

624
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That's great.

625
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
We can't do it like this.

626
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The natural rat

627
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
is trying to let us investigate it.

628
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
If we can't find it,

629
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
my father will not be able to get out.

630
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Don't worry.

631
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
There are clues and information.

632
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
My father is fine.

633
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I don't understand

634
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
what happened to the horse gang.

635
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I don't even know who I can find.

636
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I think of someone.

637
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Maybe he can help us.

638
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Sister,

639
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
should we find two guards

640
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
to go in with us?

641
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
No need.

642
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Let's go.

643
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Don't move.

644
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm so sick.

645
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Please forgive me.

646
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Don't panic.

647
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm not even sure.

648
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Please.

649
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I dare not do it.

650
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
No.

651
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Don't kill me.

652
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I...

653
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
This is fun.

654
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm so sick.

655
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm so sick.

656
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Don't kill me.

657
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm so sick.

658
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm so sick.

659
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm sick.

660
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You...

661
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm not that sick.

662
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
The escort is about to collapse.

663
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You stole my car.

664
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Boss.

665
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Don't move.

666
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Don't move.

667
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Don't move.

668
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Shun.

669
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Take the white horse.

670
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yes.

671
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Sanjiu.

672
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You've been here for so long.

673
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You still remember me?

674
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I came to see you today.

675
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I want to buy you a big deal.

676
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Let's go.

677
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You didn't hear

678
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
what the nightlife said behind you.

679
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You dare to come to see me?

680
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I heard Sanjiu is not good at trading.

681
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
He's been in a big deal.

682
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Now he's short of money.

683
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You're investigating me?

684
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I found out about the situation

685
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
of the three of you.

686
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
The nightlife is hard to keep.

687
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
You have time to manage me?

688
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
We're family.

689
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Why do you force me?

690
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
If you're an old man,

691
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
you should leave now.

692
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I came today to help Sanjiu.

693
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
After the trial,

694
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'll give you a title.

695
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
If Sanjiu thinks

696
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm here today

697
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
to fight with you,

698
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
then I won't bother you.

699
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
What can I do for you?

700
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
The new horse.

701
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
The new horse.

702
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Take a look.

703
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Take a look.

704
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Let's go.

705
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Okay.

706
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Is it necessary

707
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
to do this?

708
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Isn't it that

709
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
there are many rules in the dark world?

710
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
If a loser says something wrong,

711
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
he won't let Sanjiu make you feel uncomfortable.

712
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Am I right?

713
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You're right.

714
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Dai Lu.

715
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Let's go.

716
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Put the stick in the drawer.

717
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Who are you trying to fool?

718
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Why don't you go home

719
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
with a car?

720
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You two.

721
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Close your eyes.

722
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Look inside.

723
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Who is this?

724
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Lu Yang Guishi,

725
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
a boss of the Zongyao Boss.

726
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
He said he was a soldier before.

727
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
The battlefield is a murderous battle.

728
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Now the whole dark world is in control.

729
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I heard

730
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
that he can do

731
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
anything that the Ya's can't do.

732
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Put the stick in the drawer.

733
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And touch the fire.

734
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
What do you mean?

735
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm not going to let you go.

736
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What do you mean?

737
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You're saying that we're all fools?

738
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Let's see who's the fool.

739
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You go inside and talk.

740
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'll go first.

741
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Brother Xiao.

742
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Someone's coming.

743
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Sit.

744
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
What do you want?

745
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
My Lord, your name is Yanzi.

746
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
The foreign west jade, Tuoluo.

747
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
The Xunbian Lu Yang Wu Gu.

748
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I hope you can guide me.

749
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Tuoluo.

750
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
This is hard to find.

751
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
My Lord said

752
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
if you can help me find it,

753
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
the money I get

754
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
will be yours.

755
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
My Lord, you're generous.

756
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But

757
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I can't help you.

758
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You're generous.

759
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But

760
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
you're late.

761
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I just got a batch.

762
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It's not that fast.

763
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
My Lord,

764
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
you're so sincere.

765
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
What I said

766
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
is that you and your Lord

767
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
don't understand.

768
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Tell me

769
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
the portrait you just sold.

770
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'll find it and turn it around.

771
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You're not here to buy.

772
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You're here to ask people.

773
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
This cousin told me

774
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
he didn't harm you.

775
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
To be honest,

776
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
the government of the capital is investigating him.

777
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
If he's implicated you,

778
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
it's not good.

779
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
How dare you to threaten me?

780
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm afraid the officials of the capital will investigate me.

781
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
A'liu,

782
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
send the guest.

783
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Don't be so greedy.

784
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Let's go.

785
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Forget it.

786
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
We have other ways.

787
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You're so ridiculous.

788
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You're a good person.

789
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You're a good person.

790
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You're a good person.

791
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm afraid some people

792
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
can't do anything.

793
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
How dare you!

794
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The ghost is not the thing.

795
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
You're investigating my family.

796
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You're ruining my rules.

797
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What rules?

798
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
How dare you to buy it?

799
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Are you afraid of being investigated?

800
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
If I get a result today,

801
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
you

802
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
will be punished.

803
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You're so bold.

804
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'll give you a chance

805
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
to follow the rules.

806
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm afraid you won't dare.

807
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
What?

808
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You're a commoner.

809
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Ask him.

810
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
A gold-water war.

811
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
A gold-water war?

812
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Master,

813
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Chu Lan came to Luya today

814
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
to meet with Cheng Xi.

815
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Get ready.

816
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Let him delay the time.

817
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yes.

818
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Master,

819
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
there's one more thing.

820
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Second Lady Jiang and Third Master Ye

821
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
went to the black market.

822
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
What are you doing there?

823
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm going to find

824
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Lai Biao to help.

825
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I think Second Lady Jiang

826
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and her uncle

827
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
are not that good at it.

828
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I've heard about it.

829
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
There's a gold-water war rule in Lai Biao.

830
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
This...

831
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
A gold-water war?

832
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What war?

833
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You can understand

834
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
how to drink wine with everyone.

835
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
A gold-water war.

836
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
The gold-water war is a bet.

837
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The bet is bigger than the war.

838
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You have to drink it if you lose.

839
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
The rules are that

840
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
as long as you drink it,

841
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
they'll help us.

842
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Sixth Master.

843
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Sixth Master.

844
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Sixth Master.

845
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Sixth Master.

846
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's okay.

847
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Since we're in the water,

848
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I'll get you out of here.

849
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Just look at them.

850
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'll get ten of them.

851
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Sixth Master.

852
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Sixth Master.

853
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Sixth Master.

854
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Sixth Master.

855
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Sixth Master.

856
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The battle is over.

857
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Sixth Master.

858
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Sixth Master.

859
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Sixth Master.

860
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Sixth Master.

861
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Sixth Master.

862
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Sixth Master.

863
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Sixth Master.

864
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Sixth Master.

865
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
We two drink cold wine.

866
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
There are so many of them.

867
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's how we drink cold wine.

868
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
This is the rule of the gold-water war.

869
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
We have to drink the three times

870
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
that can defeat the three-times that defeat the town.

871
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That's how we drink the three-times that defeat the town.

872
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Three rounds.

873
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Drink.

874
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Drink.

875
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Drink.

876
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Drink.

877
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Drink.

878
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Drink.

879
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Get up.

880
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Get up.

881
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You can't do that.

882
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
There's still a mountain.

883
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
The last round.

884
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The last round.

885
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Sixth Master.

886
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Sixth Master.

887
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Sixth Master.

888
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Sixth Master.

889
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Are you okay?

890
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm fine.

891
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Don't worry.

892
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Sixth Master.

893
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Sixth Master.

894
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Sixth Master.

895
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You're lucky.

896
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
So many of you didn't drink with us.

897
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Now you're the only one.

898
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I don't want to bully you with so many people.

899
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Why don't you tell us?

900
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Third Uncle.

901
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Third Uncle.

902
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Wake up.

903
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You can't beat me at this time.

904
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
What's this?

905
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You just went to kill me.

906
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It hurts.

907
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Third Uncle.

908
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Wait.

909
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's not over yet.

910
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
If you lose, don't fight.

911
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
He said I'm fighting.

912
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm not fighting.

913
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm not fighting.

914
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Fight.

915
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Sixth Master.

916
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Sixth Master.

917
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Sixth Master.

918
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Sixth Master.

919
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Sixth Master.

920
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Sixth Master.

921
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You're so bold.

922
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You dare to break into my Golden Water Formation with only one person.

923
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'll accompany you with this.

924
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Sixth Master.

925
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Sixth Master.

926
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Next, I'll be your opponent.

927
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Fight.

928
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Fight.

929
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Fight.

930
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Fight.

931
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Fight.

932
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Fight.

933
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Fight.

934
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Fight.

935
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Fight.

936
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Fight.

937
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Fight.

938
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Fight.

939
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Fight.

940
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Fight.

941
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Fight.

942
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Fight.

943
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Fight.

944
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Fight.

945
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Fight.

946
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You have a problem with this.

947
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I'll change it.

948
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm afraid to tell you.

949
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I've been playing with the dice for so many years.

950
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I could have heard more points with my ears.

951
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
You can't beat me.

952
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Wait.

953
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You can't beat me.

954
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You can't win.

955
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Why waste your time here?

956
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I haven't been defeated yet.

957
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
When you're defeated, who will send you back?

958
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I...

959
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Don't tell me you want to sleep with us?

960
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Sleep with us.

961
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'll send him back.

962
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Who?

963
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
You can drink it.

964
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I'll send you back if you drink it.

965
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I thought you should say that you want to drink with me.

966
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
If you want me to...

967
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I don't want you to.

968
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You're really not polite.

969
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Do you remember this time?

970
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
No.

971
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Okay.

972
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You...

973
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I...

974
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Don't be afraid.

975
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Drink it.

976
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You and he are good friends.

977
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Or enemies?

978
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Don't care.

979
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'll bet with him.

980
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Who are you?

981
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
What do you want to do with the Wolf King?

982
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Why don't I accompany you to the heart?

983
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
General.

984
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Do you know him?

985
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
He was my father's death partner.

986
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
He was a prisoner after the case.

987
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I didn't want to be the king of the battlefield.

988
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
If you have the money,

989
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'll kill you.

990
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
As you wish.

991
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Is your father Xiao Minghan?

992
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yes.

993
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
You like the character of the hero and the old beauty.

994
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You're like a model.

995
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I warn you.

996
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
The rules here.

997
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
If you're going to drink it,

998
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
you have to betray him.

999
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You drink it.

1000
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm lucky today.

1001
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Open the war.

1002
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
The watchman.

1003
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
The watchman.

1004
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Drink it.

1005
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Drink it.

1006
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Drink it.

1007
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
If you keep going,

1008
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
you can't win ten little heroes.

1009
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
What should we do?

1010
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm not afraid to tell you.

1011
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I've been playing for so many years.

1012
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I've heard more about it.

1013
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Go ahead.

1014
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Then I'll kill you.

1015
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm in a hurry.

1016
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You try.

1017
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I'll do it.

1018
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You have to try.

1019
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
What are you doing?

1020
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I'm a little sleepy.

1021
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm just playing.

1022
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
You don't have to make a rule.

1023
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You don't have to make a rule.

1024
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Open it.

1025
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
The king of the Lang family.

1026
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

1027
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
What did you say?

1028
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I said, do you want to blame me for drinking?

1029
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
How could it be?

1030
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You're too heavy.

1031
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
You're out of breath.

1032
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
What are you doing?

1033
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Let's go.

1034
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Let's go.

1035
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
That's enough.

1036
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
You.

1037
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You're out.

1038
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
What?

1039
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Say it again.

1040
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
That's enough.

1041
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
If you keep going like this,

1042
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
my house will be ruined.

1043
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Then you can tell me

1044
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
the owner of the Tower of Soul.

1045
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Wait a minute.

1046
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I want to lose the battle with your subordinates.

1047
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I need to save them.

1048
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
You're here to find me

1049
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
or to save the little wolf king?

1050
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I have all of them.

1051
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I want to ask General Biao to help me.

1052
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Why should I help you?

1053
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
My father saved you.

1054
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You're a man of the people.

1055
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
You never want to fight in the court.

1056
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You were accused of being in the south

1057
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
and being killed.

1058
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
My father knew you were innocent.

1059
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
You're a man.

1060
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So he let you go.

1061
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And I can't

1062
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
deal with you this time.

1063
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I'm sorry.

1064
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I'm sorry.

1065
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I'm sorry.

1066
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I'm sorry.

1067
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm sorry.

1068
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I'm sorry.

1069
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm sorry.

1070
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I'm sorry.

1071
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I'm sorry.

1072
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I'm sorry.

1073
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I'm sorry.

1074
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I'm sorry.

1075
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I'm sorry.

1076
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I'm sorry.

1077
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm sorry.

1078
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I'm sorry.

1079
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'm sorry.

1080
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I'm sorry.

1081
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I'm sorry.

1082
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I'm sorry.

1083
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I'm sorry.

1084
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I'm sorry.

1085
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I'm sorry.

1086
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I'm sorry.

1087
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm sorry.

1088
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I'm sorry.

1089
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I'm sorry.

1090
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I'm sorry.

1091
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I believe you.

1092
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I'm willing to be trapped in the cold of the world.

1093
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I want to keep breathing.

1094
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I want to keep loving.

1095
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I want to keep knowing that you're breathing.

1096
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,000
The breath of spring is only for the rain.

1097
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,000
After the rain, I won't be far away.

1098
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:23,000
After the rain, I won't be far away.
