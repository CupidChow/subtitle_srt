1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad reasons

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly reject the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When spring comes, I'll return to the earth

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 1

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Jiang Li!

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Jiang Li!

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Your name card is down.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Have a look at what Shen Xue is giving you.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This time, Honglu Temple will take the loan to separate the sects.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I, Liu Xu, and Ye Biaoge will go to the Ministry of Rites.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They will take charge of the arrangement of the map and the set.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The Moon Palace Department?

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The Moon Palace Department?

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Isn't this bullying?

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You are so good at playing the piano.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You are also playing some normal songs with the musicians.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What's going on?

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What's the matter with Shen Xue?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Shen Xue is the leader of the whole Bureau.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He is in charge of the Han Linyuan and the people.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He is the leader of the arrangement and the set.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is the important thing that Huimeng will do.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Shen Yuerong, Shen Yuerong.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You are so afraid that I will be near you.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Are you afraid that you will be caught by me?

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Or are you afraid that Wanning will be mad at you

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and do something that will make you fall?

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It seems that the one who is the most cautious will be you.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What are you doing?

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Isn't this the master of the Moon Palace Department?

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's the point of coming to the Moon Palace Department?

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Shouldn't we go to the library?

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Miss Jiang Er.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This piano is not good.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is Mr. Xiao's piano.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What about mine?

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You are the same as them.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I want to see Mr. Xiao.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Who wants to see me?

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Mr. Xiao.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I heard from Shen Gong that

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
His Majesty wanted to hear my words.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He just drew it under his door.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Now,

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
this arrangement is not to mislead His Majesty's order.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Miss Jiang Er.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I know that you are in the age of being a puppet.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You are praised by His Majesty.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You are so arrogant.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But look at the Moon Palace Department of the Education Department.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Everyone is so arrogant.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If you don't take out some real power,

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm afraid that you can't take care of them.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Shen Gong knows that you are a puppet.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's why he wants you to come here.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's better for them to be the same.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Miss Jiang Er.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Can't you let go of your noble background?

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Mr. Xiao.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This time, the troupe is in the big trouble.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We can't let it go.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But Miss Jiang Er is a special person.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
She can forgive you once.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Today,

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
everyone in the Moon Palace is working hard.

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We will train with Miss Jiang Er until she is fully recovered.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is the song called Fang Si.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's a song that we usually practice.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I just got the Moon Pooh.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm so tired.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't take it anymore.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I can't take it anymore.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I just got the Moon Pooh.

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's really hard to catch up with everyone's level.

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But I can't be the daughter of the Prime Minister.

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I just want to drag everyone to work with me.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Mr. Xiao.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'd like to practice alone.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I want to catch up with everyone's level.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
If so,

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you can practice alone.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Miss Jiang Er is going to catch up with everyone's level.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can't catch up with everyone's level.

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If the Shen Palace is in trouble,

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can't afford it.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't worry, Mr. Xiao.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I won't let you down.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's the best.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm so tired.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I can't take it anymore.

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I just want to catch up with everyone's level.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I can't take it anymore.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I just want to catch up with everyone's level.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can't take it anymore.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I just want to catch up with everyone's level.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I just want to catch up with everyone's level.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I just want to catch up with everyone's level.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I just want to catch up with everyone's level.

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I just want to catch up with everyone's level.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I just want to catch up with everyone's level.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I just want to catch up with everyone's level.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I just want to catch up with everyone's level.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I just want to catch up with everyone's level.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Help.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I...I'm not going to catch up with him!

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What happened?

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I...I got hit!

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I got shot.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Where's the other guy?

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I needed to catch a snake.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He insisted on going after me with a fish.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So he got hit by a snake.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You dare to hit me?

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Where's the antidote?

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Then you've been here for ten years.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I heard from Wenji that you're in a hurry to see me.

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Your brother will bring the Great Zhao Group to the Great British Union soon.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You'll be able to unite then.

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's great.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're so good.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Great.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't want to see the Great Zhao and Great British Union.

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll definitely be able to break the rule of the Great British Union.

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This situation will hurt you.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You've been living in the Palace for a while.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're safer now.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So you're here to tell me this?

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You care about me so much?

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There's one more thing.

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What is it?

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Two people. One lost their will and the other was destroyed.

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Xiao Heng. Xiao Heng.

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Is it that everyone in your eyes is a pawn?

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
After the matter is settled, how much wine do you want?

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
How much wine do you have?

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Wine?

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's two lives.

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
How can it be so cheap?

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What do you want?

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You first tell me.

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Who do you want to save because of those two people?

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You're so hard to bully.

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm afraid it's not because of that Jiang Er's wife.

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Are you saving or not?

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is your attitude.

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What do you want?

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I want it.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Go catch the pig with me.

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let me see how much you really want.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Didn't you say you wanted to catch the pig?

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Catching it here?

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes.

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm not here to play with you.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This pig is going to catch it in the water.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Wait a minute.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Keep an eye on it.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes.

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why are you back?

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He took off his clothes and said that I wouldn't leave.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He said he would be in trouble in the future.

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No!

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Xiang Heng!

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So you care about me so much.

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You don't want to save people.

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Why do you have to fool me like this?

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Xiang Heng, have you ever fooled me?

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You have poison in your sword.

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Only I can cut it.

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
If I were to save you,

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
you would have saved me.

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm not a fan of you.

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You can't save me.

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm not a fan of you.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm not a fan of you.

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm not a fan of you.

187
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm not a fan of you.

188
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm not a fan of you.

189
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You still want to save me?

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You don't want to talk about the wind and moon.

191
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're just alone with me.

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So you don't want to save those two people?

193
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I can save them.

194
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I just want to risk your life.

195
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Jiuyue, don't make trouble.

196
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Fine.

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I won't make trouble.

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
As for you,

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'll save you no matter what.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Jiuyue.

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Lu Jin, protect her.

202
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yes.

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Shen Xueshi,

204
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
this is the official letter of the Red Dragon Four Seasons.

205
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Please read it.

206
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Shen Xueshi,

207
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
this is the document of the Moon Palace Department.

208
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Thank you for your care.

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Thank you.

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This meeting is very meaningful to Dayan.

211
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Next,

212
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
you two need to be more patient.

213
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You need to tell me in time.

214
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes.

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Mr. Xiao,

216
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
do you have something to say?

217
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's not important.

218
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's that Jiang Erniang

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
has been practicing in Mingyi Hall for two days.

220
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He said that he's not feeling well.

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
He might need to rest for a few more days.

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's normal to rest.

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But he's already lost his mind.

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If he can rest well,

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
he might be dragged away

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
by the Moon Palace Department.

227
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Since he's not feeling well,

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
let him rest well.

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Why is Cousin here?

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I heard from Xiao De that you're ill.

231
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I brought you some medicine.

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Thank you, Cousin.

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's just that the love of the love is not very good.

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's just that

235
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm not feeling well.

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll go to the hospital.

237
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll go to the hospital.

238
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll go to the hospital.

239
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll go to the hospital.

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
How could you let yourself get ill

241
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
just by practicing money?

242
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Cousin, I've heard from you before.

243
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
His Majesty wants to listen to me

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and let me go to the Flower of Blossom.

245
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Indeed.

246
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But why did Shen Xueshi

247
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
let me go to the Moon Palace Department?

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He said that he hopes that you can make the Moon Palace Department

249
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
work harder.

250
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But Mr. Xiao gave me a new moon cloth

251
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
because of Shen Xueshi.

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He didn't raise me to the point

253
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that he'd let me go.

254
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I've been too busy these days.

255
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I didn't notice you.

256
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll go to Shen Xueshi later.

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I really don't dare to stay at the Moon Palace Department.

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If Cousin really wants to help me,

259
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll have a way.

260
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Shen Qing is very thoughtful.

261
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm very relieved.

262
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But I shouldn't have bothered you.

263
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But I don't dare to

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
make the decision to be the daughter of the Central Secretary.

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Tell me.

266
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
His Majesty hopes that

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Jiang Erniang will represent Dayan

268
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and show his love for you.

269
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But the Flower of Blossom is not as fragile as Cousin's.

270
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The latter will be a good cause

271
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and will affect the individual.

272
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Jiang Erniang has been with Cousin for several months.

273
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He's experienced many things.

274
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's hard to avoid his love.

275
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I thought about making him go to the Moon Palace Department

276
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
to practice and recover.

277
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I didn't expect him to get ill.

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If he tries to force me,

279
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm afraid he won't be able to help me.

280
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll let the Central Secretary

281
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
think that I'm not good enough.

282
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So Shen Qing,

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
what you mean is

284
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
to make Jiang Erniang feel at ease?

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Your Majesty,

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Shen Xue Shi.

287
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I heard that after the cousin died,

288
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
he went to visit her.

289
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Mr. Xiao gave Jiang Li a book

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
that the Moon Palace Department is familiar with.

291
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But it's the first time he's been in touch with her.

292
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Jiang Li died

293
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
because he didn't want to delay the Moon Palace Department.

294
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Even so,

295
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
he still has the habit of taking care of the patients.

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He can see that he's sincere.

297
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Huimeng is very thoughtful.

298
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Jiang Li is in a state of

299
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
not practicing his heartbeats.

300
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,800
He only talks about his familiar

301
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
tricks to get into the flower garden.

302
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm afraid that when he's cured,

303
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
he won't be able to reach the age of age.

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I hope you can be careful.

305
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Jiang Li's illness

306
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
can't be recovered in a few days.

307
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Although he's not as age-old as he is,

308
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Jiang Li is talented and thoughtful.

309
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If he doesn't want to be in a state of age,

310
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
he will play the piano with Han Ling

311
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and play the violin.

312
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
He will start a new performance.

313
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He's not too old-fashioned.

314
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
He might not be able to make the Zhao Group

315
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
play the violin.

316
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What's the point of that?

317
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Don't worry, Shen Qing.

318
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's interesting to think about the idea of the piano.

319
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
When I was born,

320
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
it was a good thing for Shen Qing.

321
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Shen Qing should be at ease.

322
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yes.

323
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes.

324
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Your son

325
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
is always

326
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
trying to attract things to the right.

327
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He's capable of that.

328
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Tell me

329
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
what he wants to do in the end.

330
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Why don't you ask

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Jiang Erniang

332
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
when His Majesty is in trouble?

333
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So,

334
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
you still can't

335
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
see through

336
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
what you're doing.

337
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You can go.

338
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Isn't this Jiang Erniang?

339
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Are you from Han Lingyuan?

340
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Do you want to see

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
the young master?

342
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I told you

343
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
long ago.

344
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If you miss me,

345
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
you won't find a better one.

346
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You're wearing a good dress.

347
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You're looking good inside.

348
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I...

349
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm from Han Lingyuan.

350
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm from the troupe.

351
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You're the one.

352
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What are you doing here?

353
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Shen Xueshi is looking for me.

354
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Shen Xueshi?

355
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Shen Xueshi?

356
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Shen Xueshi?

357
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Shen Xueshi?

358
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Shen Xueshi?

359
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You two were

360
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
in the crowd just now.

361
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Why are you still here?

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Aren't you afraid of

363
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
the danger?

364
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You're not afraid of

365
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the shadow of the evil?

366
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm impressed.

367
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Shen Xueshi is looking for me.

368
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What's the matter?

369
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Didn't your cousin tell you?

370
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
After all,

371
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
this is the head of Shen Xueshi.

372
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You can tell me.

373
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
His Majesty has

374
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
proposed to Ye Shijie.

375
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Who do you want to

376
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
talk to in Han Lingyuan?

377
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Of course, Shen Xueshi

378
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
has made a decision.

379
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Since that's the case,

380
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
let's do it.

381
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You two were quiet just now.

382
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You were able to save

383
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
the world of the devil.

384
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Can we change another person?

385
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Didn't you say that I made a decision?

386
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Shen Xueshi is insistent.

387
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll listen to your arrangement.

388
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'll go to Zhao Qi to discuss it.

389
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'll start the rehearsal tomorrow.

390
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Bai Xue.

391
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I remember that

392
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Second Sister-in-law

393
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
gave me some spiritual ways to deal with it.

394
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
There's a hand-pulled

395
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
handkerchief inside.

396
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Help me find it later.

397
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
My lady,

398
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
you should have taken it earlier.

399
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Such a good cloth

400
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
should be worth the beauty like you.

401
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I didn't use it.

402
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I used it myself.

403
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's to

404
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
be the one to be the first.

405
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I wanted to see your play.

406
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But it's better this way.

407
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm the one who's going to be the play.

408
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I know you don't want to be with me.

409
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't want to be with you either.

410
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So,

411
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
you should go to Shen Xueshi to ask for his resignation.

412
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Me?

413
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes.

414
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Forget it.

415
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I've been to

416
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
the Hanlin Academy

417
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
for a long time.

418
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I can't stay here.

419
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Besides,

420
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
this is

421
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
a chance to be a pre-sale.

422
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Why should I?

423
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You must go.

424
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Otherwise,

425
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the Zhao Palace and Mrs. Zhao

426
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
will know you're out there.

427
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Sorry.

428
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's not a threat.

429
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's not a threat.

430
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There's a reason.

431
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I heard that you're looking for

432
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yun Jing's handkerchief.

433
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I brought you a top today.

434
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Look.

435
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Can you

436
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
see your beauty?

437
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Let me see.

438
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Besides,

439
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yun Jing's handkerchief

440
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
is sold by Lu Yang.

441
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's very popular in the capital.

442
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You...

443
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
How did you get it?

444
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
My grandmother's house is owned by Lu Yang.

445
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Then,

446
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'll give you

447
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
a free and handsome man.

448
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Let's go.

449
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Please,

450
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Shen Xue

451
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
is the candidate for the second wife.

452
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm married to her.

453
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Now,

454
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
she's acting.

455
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's hard to make her cry.

456
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You're not guilty.

457
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't care about the rest.

458
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Even if I'm not guilty,

459
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can't stop myself.

460
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
This is a gift for the Zhao Palace.

461
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I hope you can let go

462
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
of your personal feelings

463
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and be strong.

464
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Shen Xue.

465
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Shen Xue.

466
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
There's not much time.

467
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Go to practice.

468
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Brother.

469
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
They're not practicing.

470
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What are they doing inside?

471
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I saw you say

472
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
you're going to quit.

473
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But no.

474
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm acting.

475
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What?

476
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You're still here?

477
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm not here.

478
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm here.

479
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm here.

480
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm here.

481
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm here.

482
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm here.

483
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
What?

484
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You're still here?

485
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Can you be beautiful?

486
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Do you like that handkerchief?

487
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I have a better one.

488
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'll bring it over tomorrow.

489
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You can give it to me.

490
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Let her dance.

491
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's not good to do this.

492
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Okay.

493
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Go back.

494
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Okay.

495
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Jiang Li.

496
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You did it on purpose.

497
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
From the beginning to the end,

498
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
this is your plan.

499
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Plan?

500
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't have any plan.

501
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Shen Xue asked me to come.

502
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
How do I know

503
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
he asked me to be with you?

504
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You don't know.

505
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You pretend.

506
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I told you at the beginning.

507
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
We're not suitable.

508
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Now you're so close.

509
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You think we're just friends?

510
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
How can I marry you?

511
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You think you care about me.

512
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I don't care?

513
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What's the solution now?

514
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I have nothing to say to you.

515
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I have nothing to say to you either.

516
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Shen Xue.

517
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I asked you to see him.

518
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Go back first.

519
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Brother.

520
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Go back.

521
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Jiang Erniang.

522
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What's wrong?

523
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Didn't you practice well just now?

524
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Shen Xue did it on purpose.

525
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
On purpose?

526
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I heard

527
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
what happened to Zhao Qi

528
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
in the afternoon.

529
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Shen Xue

530
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
deliberately asked a person

531
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
to make a deal with me

532
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
to make a deal with Ren Yan.

533
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
She forced me to ask for her permission.

534
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Jiang Erniang's words are not good.

535
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Zhao Qi is a good girl.

536
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
She's a good girl.

537
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Jiang Erniang's words are not good.

538
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Zhao Qi is a good girl

539
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
in the Hanling School.

540
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
If Shen Mou doesn't do it,

541
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
how can she

542
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
deliberately

543
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
let Ye Yuan

544
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
be in the pre-registered machine?

545
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Shen Xue is Shen Yan.

546
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You're in the pre-registered machine.

547
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'll take the pre-registered machine first.

548
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You're not here to take the pre-registered machine.

549
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't know

550
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
where I offended Shen Xue.

551
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Shen Xue is a good girl

552
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
to me.

553
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
She's a good girl

554
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
to the first party.

555
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
She can handle the meeting.

556
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
She's an advocate for Yan.

557
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
She's also an angel for the Jiang family.

558
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So I won't give up.

559
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
If Shen Xue

560
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
tries to make things difficult for me,

561
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I will lose

562
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
the face of Yan.

563
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Tomorrow

564
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I'll ask for another person for you.

565
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,440
Mr. Zhao, Mr. Du.

566
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,960
I have time to talk.

567
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
What's wrong?

568
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,920
The interrogation room arranged me and Miss Jiang to shoot a show together.

569
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,120
Congratulations, Mr. Du.

570
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,480
The ceremony is a great honor.

571
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,480
I'm happy to be rewarded.

572
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,640
In the future, your attempt is a great success.

573
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,600
It looks like a great success.

574
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,640
But why do you have to ask Mr. Zhao for a word from the interrogation room?

575
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
I'm sorry.

576
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
I'm sorry.

577
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
I'm sorry.

578
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
I'm sorry.

579
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
I'm sorry.

580
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,840
I always had in mind

581
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:43,040
that you are perfect on the outside but feel a little bit

582
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,040
less attractive.

583
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,640
I'll show you why.

584
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,040
I just want to tell you that

585
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,520
sometimes it looks like a great fortune

586
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,480
but I don't know

587
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,200
that the foot is a big mistake.

588
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,760
What should we do?

589
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,920
That night

590
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,560
Jiang Ming wants to come to me to practice.

591
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,760
Mr. Zhao, please take care of Mr. Zhao.

592
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,920
Sister.

593
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,400
Shen Xue is kind.

594
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,720
I changed you after I learned my difficulty.

595
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,280
If you have difficulty,

596
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,880
we can't have difficulty

597
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,560
with so many Han Lin students.

598
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,680
Oh, I see.

599
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,960
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

600
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,240
Go.

601
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,600
Find Jiang Lin to make my pig's feet smell.

602
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,400
Yes.

603
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,560
Mr. Chen, this way.

604
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,360
Okay.

605
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,120
These things are here.

606
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
I'll go tomorrow.

607
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,440
I'll go with you.

608
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,080
Okay.

609
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,880
See you tomorrow.

610
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,680
Take care, brother.

611
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,160
Okay.

612
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,320
What's wrong?

613
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,800
I'm cold.

614
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,160
I need ice water.

615
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,560
My stomach hurts.

616
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,200
I'm not...

617
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,840
Here, I'll help you to see the doctor.

618
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,160
I can't.

619
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,040
I didn't recognize you just now.

620
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,480
I've...

621
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,640
I...

622
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,880
I've got a cold.

623
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,040
You...

624
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,680
You...

625
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,040
You...

626
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,800
Shen Xue...

627
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,000
I want to go back to the hospital.

628
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,440
Then I'll find the doctor.

629
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,840
I might not be able to attend the rehearsal tonight.

630
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I hope you can keep your mouth shut

631
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,520
and protect your reputation.

632
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,760
I'll take my leave.

633
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,920
Open all the windows.

634
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,560
Open all the windows, and watch out.

635
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,280
Miss Jiang,

636
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,000
what's wrong?

637
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,920
My cart is broken.

638
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,400
I can only come here for orders.

639
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,240
Let's start.

640
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,240
Yes.

641
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,920
You have the wrong plan.

642
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,720
I found a good student in Hanlin School

643
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,960
who is good at studying.

644
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,680
It's just that it's a coincidence that she...

645
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,440
It's okay.

646
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,680
I know that no one wants to be with me.

647
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,720
Lin Cheng is still in a daze.

648
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,400
Shen Jue Shi, I'm very funny.

649
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,640
Jiang Li,

650
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,080
I just said the word,

651
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,240
but I didn't mean to fool you.

652
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,000
She's really not feeling well today.

653
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,840
I didn't mean to blame Shen Jue Shi.

654
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,720
I was blaming myself.

655
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,640
All these years,

656
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,720
the evil name of the mother and brother

657
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,600
were questioned by the princess.

658
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,040
Mother, mother, father left home.

659
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,600
No wonder Shen Jue Shi was not in a hurry to avoid me.

660
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,680
I just wanted to prove myself to the people this time.

661
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,080
Lin Cheng Xiao,

662
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,120
it turns out that all of you

663
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,480
have already been my god of temperature.

664
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,000
Let's avoid it first.

665
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,160
Let's avoid it first.

666
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,280
The rain stopped and then we'll leave.

667
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,080
Let's avoid it first.

668
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,320
The rain is a little bit smaller.

669
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,680
This is the residence of the Han Dynasty's Prime Minister, Shuo Yuan.

670
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,160
Yes.

671
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,360
My Lord,

672
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,680
Shuo Yuan should be in there.

673
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,200
My father once said that

674
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,920
he was interested in Shuo Yuan.

675
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,440
But most of them have been deleted.

676
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,480
He said that if anyone can collect the copy,

677
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,160
it must be a merit.

678
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,240
I remember that this book has 20 copies.

679
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,400
But most of them have been deleted.

680
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,320
I didn't expect that Shen Jue Shi has collected so many.

681
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,920
To collect these copies,

682
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,000
he spent a lot of effort.

683
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,160
So I planned to make a plan.

684
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,760
So that I can keep the copy in the past.

685
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,440
I'll keep it for later.

686
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,760
Shen Jue Shi is really good.

687
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,760
Miss Jiang Er is too much.

688
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,720
But you,

689
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,480
with this copy,

690
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,520
you can know that this is Shuo Yuan.

691
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,000
You really make me feel sorry for you.

692
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,560
Shen Jue Shi is different from what I thought.

693
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
How is that different?

694
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,880
I thought that the red man in front of His Majesty

695
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,480
was an old man in Yuan Hua.

696
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,240
I didn't expect that Shen Jue Shi has the same background

697
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,720
as the one in the school.

698
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,720
I just follow the point of view in the book.

699
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,280
The shape of the human body

700
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,040
is the path of Sixth-Sixth-Stone Law.

701
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,800
You must keep your heart and mind calm.

702
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,200
You must be considerate.

703
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,680
You must not be idle.

704
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,480
You must be educated.

705
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,760
The book says that the shape of the human body

706
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,920
is the path of Sixth-Sixth-Stone Law.

707
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,760
The path of Sixth-Stone Law is to be tolerant and the path of Sixth-Sixth-Stone Law is to be tolerant.

708
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,760
The path of Sixth-Sixth-Stone Law

709
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,000
is not the path of Sixth-Sixth-Stone Law.

710
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,200
It is the path of Shaan'an and Xia-zhi.

711
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,600
Su...

712
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,600
Shen Jue Shi you are saying

713
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,480
that if a person was steam- Lobby

714
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,400
but made a snake,

715
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,960
would it be a abyss

716
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,760
or a disease?

717
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,600
Just follow the plan of His Majesty.

718
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,440
If God punishes,

719
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,880
it would be a fight

720
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,160
against the Heaven and Earth Ruin.

721
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,880
I believe Shen Xueshi is a righteous person.

722
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,880
Miss Zhang Er, you've heard it.

723
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
I'm leaving first.

724
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,880
Thank you for not saying so much to me.

725
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Goodbye.

726
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,880
I've washed your clothes and brought them to you.

727
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
I'm leaving first.

728
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
What's so disgusting about this?

729
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
You've made yourself so lonely.

730
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,880
Mr. Su, why are you here?

731
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,880
Your clothes are in a hurry.

732
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,880
Come with me.

733
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
Mr. Su,

734
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,880
I'm sorry.

735
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
I'm sorry.

736
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,880
I'm sorry.

737
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,880
I'm sorry.

738
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
I'm sorry.

739
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
I'm sorry.

740
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
I'm sorry.

741
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
I'm sorry.

742
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
I'm sorry.

743
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,880
I'm sorry.

744
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
I'm sorry.

745
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm sorry.

746
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
I'm sorry.

747
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
I'm sorry.

748
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
I'm sorry.

749
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
I'm sorry.

750
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
I'm sorry.

751
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
I'm sorry.

752
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
I'm sorry.

753
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
I'm sorry.

754
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
I'm sorry.

755
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
I'm sorry.

756
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
I'm sorry.

757
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
I'm sorry.

758
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
I'm sorry.

759
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
I'm sorry.

760
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
I'm sorry.

761
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
What's wrong?

762
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Why there's no woman in your house?

763
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
You even know my identity.

764
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
You don't know this time?

765
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
They said you don't like women.

766
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
But why?

767
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Women are so good.

768
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
They are warm and warm.

769
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
They are fit and fit.

770
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
What about you?

771
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
You're not young anymore.

772
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
You're not young anymore.

773
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
I think I've been living a good life

774
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
all alone for a while.

775
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
Love and love.

776
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
To kill people.

777
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
You're the one who can tell me that.

778
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
I'm just saying.

779
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,880
There's one thing I want to remind you.

780
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Shen Yu Rong is not a good woman.

781
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
I have to do that.

782
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
I want to face her.

783
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
Like the mysterious princess in the powder.

784
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,880
I want to catch her hairpin

785
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
and wash the hairpin with it.

786
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
What hairpin?

787
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
I haven't found her yet.

788
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
She will lose her hairpin in a while.

789
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
Do you have any consequences?

790
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,880
Xiao Heng, you can make it clearer.

791
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,880
The princess's reaction will take my life.

792
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
And my aunt is a person.

793
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,880
She may not be a self-sufficient person.

794
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
You said it yourself.

795
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
It means you're afraid.

796
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,880
People have the advantage.

797
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
It's a good thing.

798
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,880
I do feel that after I told you,

799
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
I've relaxed a lot.

800
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
I have the ability to heal.

801
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,880
I'm not bad.

802
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Eat chicken.

803
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
Is Jiuyue back?

804
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
She's back. She's gone again.

805
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,880
I remember you and that lady.

806
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
But you know her.

807
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,880
She's been too casual.

808
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,880
I'm in trouble.

809
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
You have to help me.

810
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,880
Don't scare me.

811
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,880
No matter what you do in the future,

812
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,880
don't put yourself in there.

813
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,880
You can kneel.

814
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,880
I can't.

815
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
Okay.

816
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
No.

817
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,880
No.

818
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
Where did you go, Yurong?

819
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
I'm in the imperial court.

820
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,880
I came to fix something.

821
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
I'm here to teach you.

822
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
Stop pretending.

823
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Your sister told me when you came back.

824
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,880
Tonight,

825
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,880
are you with that Jiang Li tonight?

826
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,880
No.

827
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,880
You don't know Qingzhou now.

828
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,880
Have you forgotten our family's hard days?

829
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,880
Dad, I'll avenge you.

830
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,880
You've avenged the Tangguan.

831
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,880
There will be other Tangguans who will kill us.

832
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Unless you take the crown.

833
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,880
Otherwise, you can't avenge them.

834
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,880
You'll hurt us.

835
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
Yujia.

836
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,880
Don't worry.

837
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
I'll study hard.

838
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,880
I'll be a good official.

839
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,880
I'll take all the Tangguans.

840
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,880
Have you forgotten the promise you made to your father?

841
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,880
How unbearable it is to have everything you've got now.

842
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
What do you think?

843
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
If Princess Zhang knows

844
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,880
you and that Jiang Erniangzi who looks like Consort Xue

845
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
will be together, what will she think?

846
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,880
They're not one person.

847
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
Don't talk about it again.

848
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
Am I right?

849
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
Am I important?

850
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,880
Princess Zhang thinks she's Consort Xue.

851
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,880
Imagine your revenge.

852
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,880
Imagine how good our family's life is.

853
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Son, you can't play with your own anger.

854
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Mother, don't remind me.

855
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,880
I know the way I'm going.

856
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,880
Chu Xun, don't say that.

857
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,880
It's quite strange to feel poisoned.

858
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,880
I saw a beautiful woman by my side.

859
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
I was so hugged.

860
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
I was so hugged again.

861
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
I was...

862
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,880
Let the wine bottle hold you for a while.

863
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
No, no.

864
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,880
I was joking.

865
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
You must be drunk.

866
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,880
How much wine do you need?

867
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,880
It's good to drink with a single bottle.

868
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,880
It's good that you locked her up in the mansion

869
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
and waited for the arrival of the Zhao Group.

870
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
Wenji, send her to the room.

871
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,880
Lu Ji, go to the wine shop with me.

872
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Isn't Lu Ji in charge of it?

873
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Just let Lu Ji take her back.

874
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,880
You've already solved it.

875
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
Just keep watching her.

876
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
You...

877
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,880
Don't...

878
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Let me out!

879
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,880
Come on!

880
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
I'm not a person.

881
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
Stay here.

882
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Before the Zhao Group arrives,

883
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,880
you don't have to go anywhere.

884
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
How dare you!

885
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,880
I've never been locked up since I was a child.

886
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,880
You'd better let me out as soon as possible.

887
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Otherwise...

888
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
Otherwise...

889
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,880
What if I do?

890
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
Wenji, what do you want?

891
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,880
I've already been locked up.

892
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
Stop being so mean to me.

893
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
Anyway,

894
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,880
you can't leave the palace today.

895
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,880
Wenji, you're bold.

896
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
I'll stay here.

897
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
Where do you want to go?

898
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,880
I want to go to the night mansion.

899
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,880
Didn't Xiang Heng ask me to save Xue Xianling?

900
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,880
I'll go to cure the illness.

901
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
I'll go now.

902
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Wenji is such a liar.

903
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
You know it very well.

904
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,880
Xiang Heng asked me to go to cure Xue Xianling.

905
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,880
He didn't even want to go with me to catch the pig.

906
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,880
And you should know

907
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,880
that Jiang Li means a lot to him.

908
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,880
If Xue Xianling doesn't cure him in time,

909
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,880
that's all your responsibility.

910
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,880
By then,

911
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,880
it won't be as simple as raising a husband.

912
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,880
I'm not a man who can raise a husband.

913
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
What's the matter?

914
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,880
I'm here to cure Xue Xianling.

915
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,880
You can't see her.

916
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,880
You're a good person.

917
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
I can report to the court.

918
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
Ye Yongwan,

919
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,880
we're here to cure Xue Xianling

920
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
and you know her very well.

921
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,880
You're from the Duke Su's palace.

922
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,880
You know her?

923
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,880
You can let me in first.

924
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
No, I can't.

925
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,880
Jiang Li didn't tell me about this.

926
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
I'll tell her first.

927
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
Then you two can go.

928
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,880
I see.

929
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,880
He hates Xiang Heng, right?

930
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,880
Look at you.

931
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Can you be more quiet?

932
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,880
Our master doesn't want to be with her.

933
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
You two,

934
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
don't talk.

935
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,880
Don't talk.

936
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,880
You just say it.

937
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
Do you want me to go in?

938
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
No.

939
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,880
You don't want me to go in, do you?

940
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
Ye Shijian, don't let her...

941
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Wait.

942
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
I've checked.

943
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,880
I'm going in to cure her.

944
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,880
Stop there.

945
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,880
Listen to me.

946
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,880
Eat well.

947
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
You...

948
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
You...

949
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,880
Don't touch her.

950
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,880
Don't mind.

951
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
She's sick.

952
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
She can't be cured.

953
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
No.

954
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,880
Where did you get the magic pot?

955
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,880
Who allowed you to touch Xue Xianling?

956
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,880
Where is she?

957
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,880
I can cure her.

958
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
But I can cure her in a day.

959
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,880
The poison...

960
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
The poison is heavy.

961
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,880
Maybe she's gone.

962
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,880
So I'll come here every day.

963
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
You don't know anything.

964
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,880
Just ask your manager.

965
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,880
Wenjing, take her out.

966
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
The next treatment is toxic.

967
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
You have to avoid it.

968
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,880
I'm not leaving.

969
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
I'm going to the hospital.

970
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
I have to avoid it.

971
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,880
I'm not leaving.

972
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
You think you're not good enough?

973
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,880
Give me the magic pot.

974
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
I'll go by myself.

975
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880
Can you give me the magic pot?

976
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,880
Why are you in a hurry?

977
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,880
I'll give it to you when she's done.

978
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,880
I'll go by myself.

979
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,880
Give it to me.

980
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,880
who hesitate a blade

981
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,920
who dies

982
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,000
go to the fire

983
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,120
what a sad

984
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
What are you waiting for? Go find the main force!

985
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
I'm taking the antidote.

986
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,880
Open your mouth!

987
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,880
The main force is in the hotel!

988
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,880
Go!

989
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,880
Save the front.

990
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,880
You're not my opponent.

991
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,880
You're so confident.

992
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,880
You're just going to fight?

993
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,880
Only him?

994
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,880
Not my opponent.

995
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,880
I can only take one.

996
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,880
What are you doing?

997
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,880
What are you doing?

998
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,880
This thing seems to be quite useful.

999
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,880
How do I feel?

1000
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,880
My face...

1001
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,880
The wound...

1002
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,880
is still warm.

1003
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,880
I'm fine.

1004
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,880
I'm fine.
