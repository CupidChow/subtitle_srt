1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't admit it

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain of hiding

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When the spring color is still the same

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 19

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Third Brother.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Coming.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Slowly.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Slowly.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Slowly.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
My dear.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you leaving?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why don't we go to the Xiangjin's house?

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We were so stupid last night.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now we're going.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Maybe there's a man who's willing to help us.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I won't bother you.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's go.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Stop.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who's the front?

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The horse carriage of the Ministry of Justice.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What's the matter?

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's nothing.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It seems like the front is the person in jail.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There was a news that I don't believe it.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Under the long and difficult time,

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
there really was someone who dared to be bold and bold.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm the daughter of the Grand Master of the Central Academy.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I believe Xue Huaiyuan is innocent.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How can she be innocent?

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I want to take Xue Xie's order to the imperial court.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There's no consequence.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll bear the burden of my family.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I hope you'll let me go.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Take the dead ball.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Sir.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Can you listen to me?

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm ordered to ban Xue Huaiyuan from the capital.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Today, I only want to talk to the government.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll give the order to Jiang Erniang to leave immediately.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't let me go.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Since ancient times,

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
the books are closed.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The officials are not famous.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But the officials just said that

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
they only talk to the government.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
They say they're not famous.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They're just people.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm willing to go to the capital.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
How dare you!

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll take the dead ball away.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What about the officials?

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They don't investigate the case.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They don't listen to the accusation.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They kill the innocent.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The officials are not guilty.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I think in the face of the country,

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
you have a gun on your right hand.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You can be punished for your crime.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But you're so arrogant.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How dare you take the position of the court official?

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're a man.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You can't be punished.

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There are other places in Huaixiang.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Why do I have to go?

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll send myself to the official's mansion.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I have no other way.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The daughter of the Grand Preceptor, Jiang Li,

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
took the dead ball away from Xue Huaiyuan.

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The evidence is confirmed.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's not easy to solve.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Jiang Li asked to enter the Grand Preceptor.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Please, the Grand Preceptor,

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
take the case of the death ball

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and the case of the suspect in Huaiyuan.

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The suspect is in the case.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Great.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're the one

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
to take the dead ball away.

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Do you understand?

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I understand.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I have no other way.

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I must take Xue Huaiyuan to the capital.

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Even if I die,

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I will definitely be in this month.

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This matter is important.

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You can't change it.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Even if Jiang Xiangguo stands here,

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
he can't stop me from taking the law.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Until now, I still advise mother Jiang to say that

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
don't destroy Jiang Xiangguo's life.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Come on.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Take the world down.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Sir.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The bloodline is really innocent.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We are the officials of the bloodline.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We can testify for the bloodline.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Our name is recorded.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We will testify for the bloodline.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We will testify for the bloodline.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Stop talking nonsense.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Take them away.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Sir.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let go of me.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't move.

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let go of me.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Li.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Li.

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Sir.

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Send the dead to the execution hall.

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Sir.

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Sir.

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Sir.

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let go of me.

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let go of me.

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sir.

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let go of me.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sir.

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Let go of me.

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let go of me.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let go of me.

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Li.

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let go of me.

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I am the murderer's subordinate.

150
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Old Zhang.

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I lost my leg.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's a bad way to get to the execution hall.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The bloodline

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
has done so many good things for the Xiangqin.

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You are afraid that

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
the bloodline will do the execution for you.

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I came to you

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
to tell the Xiangqin

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
to say a few good words for the bloodline.

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We should be kind.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I am sorry.

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I am sorry.

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Liu Xuezi asked me to help him.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I am a murderer.

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can't do anything in this life.

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I am a guard.

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I will stand up today

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and kill the subordinate.

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Without the bloodline,

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
we will have no money for the people.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I will stand up today.

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I have no money and no care.

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I will use these two murder knives.

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Today, I will use these two knives

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
to kill the people of Xiangqin.

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I will go to the execution hall.

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I will go to the execution hall.

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Take them with you.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You want to catch them?

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Just catch them with me.

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Catch them all.

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I am sorry.

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
In the past,

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Feng Yutang killed us.

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We are really afraid.

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So we dare not care about you.

187
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But God is watching us.

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If we keep watching you,

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
we will be in trouble.

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You...

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You are...

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
When we came to the execution hall,

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
we were so lucky to have the bloodline.

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If we didn't die,

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I would have to save him.

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Before that...

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You stay at home.

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't want you to die.

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Thank you.

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I was wronged.

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Please investigate.

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay.

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Today,

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I will catch one.

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Catch him.

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Wait.

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Catch them all.

208
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes.

209
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Catch them all.

210
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Catch them all.

211
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I am sorry.

212
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I was too weak yesterday.

213
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Mother.

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Why don't we go to save Uncle Xue?

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We are from Danli.

216
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Uncle Xue helped mother to wait for those bad uncles.

217
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He also bought sugar and mud for Ping'an.

218
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You don't go. I go.

219
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Wait.

220
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Ping'an.

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If you go to save Uncle Xue this time,

222
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
what will they do to you?

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I am not afraid.

224
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Mother.

225
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't be afraid.

226
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I am the Prime Minister of the family.

227
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I am the Prime Minister of the 15th-century.

228
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I can also testify.

229
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There is no evidence.

230
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But Feng Yutang,

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
he is a good man.

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He is polite.

233
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You don't know anything?

234
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Today,

235
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I will catch one.

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I will catch one.

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I will catch one.

238
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I will catch one too.

239
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Mother, let's go.

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I am the Prime Minister of the family's prime minister.

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Mo Wenxuan of the three tribes.

242
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The late Mr. Xue was too silent.

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He must be wronged.

244
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I will write for him.

245
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I will do it for him.

246
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,040
Mr. Senior colleague!

247
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:18,100
All members of Wux moderates, bow in your honour!

248
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,620
You..

249
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,780
Why are you all silent?

250
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,380
My lord, we are living in Huaixiang for a long time.

251
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,980
My lord, we are willing to learn the Holy Land.

252
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,580
My lord, please let Lady Jing'er go.

253
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,580
My lord, please let Lady Jing'er go.

254
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,380
Lady Jing'er, please let Lady Jing'er go.

255
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,180
Lady Jing'er, don't say that we are warning you.

256
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,380
If you can't let her go,

257
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,780
the Great Lixi will be destroyed three times.

258
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,780
You are also a dead man.

259
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,180
Go!

260
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,780
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

261
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,780
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

262
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

263
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,780
I really don't know what to say.

264
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,780
Lady Jing'er, you don't have to say anything.

265
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,780
You have done enough.

266
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,780
I can see you

267
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,780
giving yourself to the Great Lixi.

268
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,780
You are a noble and noble person.

269
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:31,780
We all want you to be clean and pure and innocent.

270
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,780
You are safe and sound.

271
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,780
Clean and pure and innocent.

272
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,780
Be safe and sound.

273
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,780
Don't worry, Lady Jing'er.

274
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,780
As long as we can make the Holy Land,

275
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,780
we will do anything.

276
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,780
We will do anything.

277
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,780
We will do anything.

278
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,780
We will do anything.

279
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,780
We will do anything.

280
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,780
Lord Chu, don't go to see her off.

281
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,780
Since her work is done,

282
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,780
I don't need to go.

283
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,780
I have something to say.

284
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,780
Lady Jiang'er, she is this.

285
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,780
The Jiang clan is a military camp.

286
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,780
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

287
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,780
Some people won't let her be so relaxed

288
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,780
and bring the villagers back to the capital.

289
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,780
Then we have to go all the way?

290
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,780
This is not a problem that depends on us.

291
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,780
It's a problem that depends on us.

292
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,780
Leji, prepare the pen for me.

293
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,780
I want to write two secrets.

294
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,780
Yes.

295
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,780
Huai Xiang's case is long and long.

296
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,780
I think my father has a good sense of humor.

297
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,780
Please tell my uncle Jiang to be free

298
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,780
and tell him to follow me.

299
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,780
He won't be disturbed.

300
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,780
I don't have any concern.

301
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,780
Lady, there is a secret letter from Huai Xiang.

302
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,780
Put it here.

303
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,780
Yes.

304
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,780
Huai Xiang's people are 23.

305
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,780
He is willing to marry Xue Huaiyuan.

306
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,780
He has a good temper and is six months old.

307
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,780
He doesn't want to be a daughter.

308
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,780
He is the one who is responsible for his own health.

309
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,780
Everything is fine now.

310
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,780
Father is missing.

311
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,780
What a joke!

312
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,780
Since ancient times, people have been so angry with us.

313
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,780
They are like the people who have been accused of treason.

314
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,780
They are like the people who have been accused of treason.

315
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,780
There is not much room for them to write a letter.

316
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,780
They are so ungrateful!

317
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,780
Prime Minister Jiang,

318
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,780
I am worried about the letter I have heard in the capital.

319
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,780
But, I have been with my cousin.

320
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,780
He told me that my cousin is brave and dreamy.

321
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,780
Huai Xiang's people are teaching her well.

322
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,780
Ye Yuanwei.

323
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,780
You are young and not sure of your strength.

324
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,780
People are teaching her well.

325
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,780
The doctor is teaching her well.

326
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,780
It means she is making a promise.

327
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,780
She is asking her husband to go to the exam.

328
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,780
Li is so worried.

329
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,780
She is not saying hello to us as parents.

330
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,780
Madam, you are so worried about her.

331
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,780
She is not like this for the first time.

332
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,780
But her parents are so reckless.

333
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,780
They dare to stop her.

334
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,780
They are so bold to take her.

335
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,780
Look at them.

336
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,780
The people in the capital

337
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,780
can give us a crime of treason by force.

338
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,780
Then,

339
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,780
you should send Li a letter.

340
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
It's late.

341
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,780
Her letter has arrived.

342
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,780
The court has passed it.

343
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,780
I am afraid that His Majesty will be asked about it soon.

344
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,780
Do you have a plan to deal with her?

345
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,780
Yes, Madam.

346
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,780
Yes.

347
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,780
Send someone to bring Li back.

348
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,780
Prime Minister Jiang.

349
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,780
I am sorry to tell you that

350
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,780
if you bring the people back,

351
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,780
I am afraid that it's not good for the people.

352
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,780
I am afraid that I have to take the responsibility.

353
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,780
If you send the people back,

354
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,780
please send me back.

355
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,780
I will be in charge of the case.

356
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,780
I think I can persuade you.

357
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,780
Senior sister,

358
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,780
it's a big matter.

359
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,780
You are brothers and sisters.

360
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,780
Please don't make trouble for me.

361
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,780
I am so worried about you.

362
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,780
Can the people in the capital persuade Li?

363
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
Is there anything wrong with the family?

364
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,780
Wait and see.

365
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,780
This girl.

366
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,780
I hope that she can't go back to the capital.

367
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,780
If she comes back,

368
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,780
it will be a big deal.

369
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,780
Ye Biaoge.

370
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,780
Why don't you talk to me?

371
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,780
I am talking about Jiang Li.

372
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,780
Ye Biaoge.

373
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,780
Take me with you.

374
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,780
We are brothers.

375
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,780
We are united.

376
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,780
We are united.

377
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
Ye Biaoge.

378
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
Take this.

379
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,780
Take it on the way.

380
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,780
If you are bored,

381
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,780
go back to your little turtle.

382
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,780
I am going to the town to pick up the trash.

383
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,780
Don't give me the map.

384
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,780
Ye Biaoge.

385
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,780
I have more than one.

386
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,780
I can still hit you.

387
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,780
No.

388
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,780
Take me with you.

389
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,780
You don't take me with you.

390
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,780
I don't want to go.

391
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,780
I don't have time to fight with you.

392
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,780
Get off.

393
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,780
I don't want to.

394
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
You don't want to do anything?

395
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,780
I don't want to.

396
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,780
Fine.

397
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,780
What are you doing?

398
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,780
You are playing with me.

399
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,780
Go back to your little turtle.

400
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,780
I am going to the town to pick up the trash.

401
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,780
Don't be so greedy.

402
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,780
I am going to the town to pick up the trash.

403
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,780
No.

404
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,780
I just want my good sister.

405
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,780
Why are you so heartless?

406
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,780
Do you really want to see me

407
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,780
wash my face every day?

408
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,780
Fine.

409
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,780
You are not a human.

410
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,780
Don't blame me for being unruly.

411
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,780
Everyone come and see.

412
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,780
Ye Biaoge.

413
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,780
He is a man who is unruly.

414
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,780
He is so heartless.

415
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,780
He is unruly.

416
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,780
Jiang Jingrui, are you crazy?

417
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,780
Ye Biaoge.

418
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,780
You finally know that I am sick.

419
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,780
I am now

420
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,780
sick and panicked.

421
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,780
If you don't take me there,

422
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,780
you will never see me.

423
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,780
That's great.

424
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,780
Ye Shijie.

425
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,780
You are so heartless.

426
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,780
You are so heartless, Ye Shijie.

427
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,780
You are heartless.

428
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,780
It's you.

429
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,780
Ye Shijie.

430
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,780
Pack up and get in the car.

431
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,780
I am going to pack up.

432
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
I am going to pack up.

433
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,780
Go.

434
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
Wait.

435
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,780
Don't you hit me?

436
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,780
Ye Shijie.

437
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
Your Majesty.

438
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,780
This time, the drought is over a thousand.

439
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,780
The area is very wide.

440
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,780
The people have reached a thousand.

441
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,780
But please rest assured.

442
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,780
There are many counties around the area.

443
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,780
The warehouse is full of food and water.

444
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,780
It's just that the people who are poor

445
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,780
are not good at fishing.

446
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,780
I am in a hurry to catch people.

447
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
I have to catch people.

448
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,780
I will not be in a hurry to catch people.

449
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,780
I am very relieved to be in the Li Qing.

450
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,780
Last year, the flood in the southwest

451
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,780
caused you to be a member of the old village.

452
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,780
To avoid the suffering of many people,

453
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,780
the food is the food of the country.

454
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,780
This time,

455
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,780
I will also give my people to you.

456
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

457
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,780
Jiang Qing.

458
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,780
Don't you have anything to say to me?

459
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,780
I am very afraid.

460
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,780
My daughter is in the Huaixiang Festival.

461
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,780
She is very panic.

462
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,780
I call you to do anything.

463
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,780
You deserve to be punished.

464
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,780
Li Qing.

465
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

466
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,780
What crime is the festival?

467
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,780
Your Majesty.

468
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,780
The festivalers are to be executed in the case of the criminal.

469
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,780
Jiang Qing.

470
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,780
I have already taken part in your memorial.

471
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,780
There are many words that are not in the way.

472
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,780
You can't be punished.

473
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,780
I can't bear to see it.

474
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,780
I am very panic.

475
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,780
Zhong Shuli.

476
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,780
You are the first emperor to leave me a life-long debt.

477
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,780
I really can't bear to be punished.

478
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,780
I decide to meet your daughter first.

479
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,780
And then be executed.

480
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,780
Yes.

481
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,780
Do you know what's wrong?

482
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,780
Do you know what's wrong?

483
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,780
Do you know what's wrong?

484
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,780
I will kill you.

485
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,780
You are so angry.

486
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,780
I left the Huaixiang Festival to you.

487
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,780
But what are you doing?

488
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,780
Do you treat me like a princess?

489
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,780
Do you really do it?

490
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,780
Do you really do it?

491
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,780
Get up.

492
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,780
Get up.

493
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,780
I will kill you.

494
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,780
I will kill you.

495
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,780
Prime Minister.

496
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,780
Stop fighting.

497
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,780
This child is so pitiful.

498
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,780
Your Highness.

499
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,780
I have made a mistake.

500
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,780
Please punish me.

501
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,780
Prime Minister, come in.

502
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,780
Yes, Your Highness.

503
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,780
I will be punished if I am here.

504
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,780
Princess Zhang.

505
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,780
I will give you the order to be executed today.

506
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,780
You can do whatever you want.

507
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
Come on.

508
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,780
Put on her clothes.

509
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,780
Take her away.

510
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

511
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,780
Thank you, Princess Zhang.

512
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
Mei Xiang.

513
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,780
Have some tea.

514
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,780
Yes.

515
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,780
Prime Minister.

516
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,780
Please sit.

517
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,780
I dare not.

518
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,780
Please sit.

519
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,780
I will do it.

520
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,780
I dare not.

521
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,780
Prime Minister.

522
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,780
This is a good tea.

523
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,780
I really like Princess Zhang.

524
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Have a taste.

525
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,780
I have made a promise, Your Highness.

526
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,780
The gold mine is gone.

527
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,780
If you die in the Dragon King,

528
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,780
if you don't

529
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,780
take care of me

530
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,780
for so many years,

531
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,780
I don't want to keep you alive.

532
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,780
But you have such a bad habit now.

533
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,780
Prime Minister.

534
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,780
What should I do?

535
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,780
Although Princess Zhang didn't die,

536
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,780
she did commit a big crime.

537
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,780
I can't let her die.

538
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,780
She is so bad.

539
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,780
It means

540
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,780
she killed the Emperor.

541
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,780
What if she can't?

542
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,780
Once the gold mine is gone,

543
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,780
I will be in a terrible situation.

544
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,780
I can't even protect you.

545
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,780
Tell me.

546
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,780
Mei Xiang.

547
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,780
Have some tea.

548
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,780
No.

549
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,780
No.

550
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,780
But

551
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,780
His Majesty has mentioned this

552
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,780
and I am afraid that

553
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
it's not appropriate to kill him.

554
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,780
Prime Minister.

555
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,780
The tea is hot.

556
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,780
Don't worry, Your Highness.

557
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,780
I will make a move.

558
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,780
I will definitely make it.

559
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,780
And

560
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,780
I will make the Jiang family

561
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,780
be more powerful.

562
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,780
I promise.

563
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,780
Don't.

564
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,780
Don't let me down again.

565
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,780
Has Shen Yurong come to me these days?

566
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,780
Your Highness.

567
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,780
He didn't.

568
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,780
He is my hostess.

569
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,780
Then I will see

570
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,780
how long he can wait.

571
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,780
This lady of the Jiang family

572
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,780
is so aggressive.

573
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,780
She brought a man

574
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,780
who is not close to her.

575
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,780
She came back to the prison.

576
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,780
Yes.

577
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,780
I don't know.

578
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,780
Yes.

579
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,780
Get in the car.

580
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,780
Yes.

581
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,780
Wait.

582
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,780
No need.

583
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,780
No need.

584
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,780
I am coming.

585
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,780
Thank you.

586
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,780
Your Majesty.

587
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,780
Thank you.

588
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
You have been my hostess.

589
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,780
Thank you.

590
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,780
Thank you.

591
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,780
Thank you.

592
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,780
Thank you.

593
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,780
Thank you.

594
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,780
Thank you.

595
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,780
Thank you.

596
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,060
We don't have enough food.

597
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,020
This chicken farm

598
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,620
is not far from here.

599
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,340
I'll find food for you.

600
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,820
Please.

601
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,540
Let's think of a way.

602
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,740
I'll help you to the villagers.

603
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,100
Come on, drink some water.

604
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:23,860
Li.

605
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,860
Let's eat.

606
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,340
Okay.

607
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,140
It's okay.

608
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,300
It's okay.

609
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,380
It's okay.

610
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,020
Okay.

611
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,060
Okay.

612
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,340
A lullaby.

613
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:45,180
Among all the climbając.

614
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:54,460
A sound of crying.

615
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,940
I know you don't know the sick in church.

616
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,860
You're too caring for

617
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,740
Xue Xianling.

618
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,180
Even if it's a repayment, it's not that much of a deal.

619
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,280
When we arrive in the capital, we'll let the people of Jiang family see it.

620
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,980
There's no need to be a demon.

621
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,880
Third Uncle, you should know that

622
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,880
my father abandoned me in Zhen Nui Hall for ten years, no matter what.

623
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,380
Xue Xianling's daughter died for saving me.

624
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,580
That's why I'm willing to be her biological father.

625
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,380
I know you're a child who's known to report.

626
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,380
But there's one thing that needs you to take into consideration.

627
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,580
What's wrong?

628
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,380
Since we entered Dingzhou,

629
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,780
we've been missing each other for a long time.

630
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,180
I asked the village government, the more we went forward, the more we were panicked.

631
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,680
Then the court didn't have any disaster?

632
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Yes. It's enough for each person to drink a bowl of porridge every day.

633
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,780
Is there any other way to go?

634
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,780
We can go around Liaozhou.

635
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,180
But the capital is on the north side.

636
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,980
It's so crowded that we can't go around.

637
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,980
At least we can go out as far as possible.

638
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,380
They don't want us to go as far as possible.

639
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,780
It's better to sit in the dark.

640
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,380
There are still many dreams in the night. We should go to Dingzhou.

641
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,980
We have many people, but it's hard to go. We should go separately.

642
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,380
You're all the people who trust my father and me.

643
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,780
Today, I want to ask you all to remember.

644
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,980
Now, my identity is Jiang Jia'er's second wife.

645
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,380
If I make any mistakes in the capital, I won't be able to save my father.

646
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,180
I will also ruin our lives.

647
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,180
Okay. We'll remember.

648
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,680
Other people, please explain to me.

649
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,480
Gu Da, you will be very skilled.

650
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,880
You must take good care of everyone to ensure their safety.

651
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,980
Don't worry. Take care.

652
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,580
We'll meet at Dingzhou.

653
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,180
Have a safe trip.

654
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,280
Take care.

655
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,980
Be careful.

656
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,680
We'll also be going.

657
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,180
Be careful.

658
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,480
Everyone, please take care of yourselves.

659
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,880
Don't be anxious.

660
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,080
Next.

661
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,480
Everyone has their own way. Don't be anxious.

662
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,980
Here, yours.

663
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,280
Thank you.

664
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Let's go.

665
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,480
Come, the team behind.

666
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,280
What are you doing?

667
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,480
Come, let's go.

668
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,280
Sanjiu, we'll go buy some food for the next trip.

669
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,680
It's okay to be on a high price.

670
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,280
No matter what, we must leave tomorrow morning.

671
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,180
Okay.

672
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,980
Follow the pavilion.

673
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,580
A Li!

674
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,380
Liu Xun?

675
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,980
Liu Xun, why are you in Dingzhou at this time?

676
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,980
My father ordered to escort the court's Zhenzai Liang to Dingzhou.

677
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,580
I followed him.

678
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,880
I thought that the food was delivered and the mission was over.

679
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,780
Dingzhou is very noisy.

680
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,580
The food storage inside the city is empty.

681
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,380
The people are gathered outside the city.

682
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,180
Dingzhou's local government is not coming over.

683
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,780
They can't guard it.

684
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,180
So my father led the team to stay.

685
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,180
He helped Dingzhou to deliver the food.

686
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,780
The situation is very bad.

687
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,180
It's quite serious.

688
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,180
Before, the court said that there was a group of Zhenzai Liang on the road.

689
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,580
But they couldn't stop.

690
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,980
Without food, I'm afraid that they'll be in a mess.

691
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,380
Be careful.

692
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,480
After all, people can do anything to survive.

693
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,880
I've been seeing the situation of the victims.

694
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,880
I've already predicted it.

695
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,880
I've already lost the way to the people.

696
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,280
The rest of us will leave tomorrow morning.

697
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,480
I thought that I could see you this time.

698
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,080
I can reject you.

699
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,080
I didn't expect that you would leave again.

700
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,680
You don't even know that I'm almost bored in the capital.

701
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,880
Ye Shijie and Jiang Jingrui are not all in the capital.

702
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,680
Don't mention Jiang Jingrui to me.

703
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
You always make me angry.

704
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,680
I hate to see him.

705
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,680
Ye Shijie is also a nerd.

706
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,480
He's busy with his work.

707
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,080
I rarely see him.

708
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,280
After all, he just joined the Ministry of Health.

709
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,480
It's possible that he's not a nerd.

710
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,680
He just doesn't want to be my only concern.

711
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,480
You... You let it go.

712
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,080
I'm the only one who likes me.

713
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,480
It's because I'm careless.

714
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,880
I won't waste my time.

715
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
Open the door!

716
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Don't see the second wife!

717
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Open the door!

718
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
What should we do?

719
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,280
How do they know that Li lives here?

720
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:23,880
I don't know.

721
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,480
Could it be that they found the wife of the house?

722
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
Or could it be that the villagers could have leaked it?

723
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,880
That's impossible.

724
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,880
Master, why don't I ask the second wife out?

725
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
Let's hold them in first.

726
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
No.

727
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,880
Li can't be here at this time.

728
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
I'll go meet them.

729
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
Open the door.

730
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
I don't know.

731
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
I don't know.

732
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Someone's coming.

733
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Ladies, let's go find the second wife.

734
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
So many people.

735
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Want to fight?

736
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
No.

737
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
No.

738
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Master, we just want to see the second wife.

739
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Who told you that she's here?

740
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
I heard.

741
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
Who told you?

742
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,880
I really heard.

743
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
Some annoying brothers told me

744
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,880
that the second wife was so bold and willing to give the order to Gao Yuzhuang.

745
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,880
So she must be able to help us.

746
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
We agreed to come here together.

747
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
Please help the second wife.

748
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
Help us.

749
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Help us.

750
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Yes.

751
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Please help the second wife.

752
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Help the second wife.

753
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Shut up.

754
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
You're being a monkey.

755
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
You know that?

756
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Forget it.

757
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
We didn't do anything.

758
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
Help the second wife.

759
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,140
怎么办,

760
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,480
here.

761
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,880
All right.

762
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
Do these things crunchy.

763
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:15,420
Shen Zhen is fine.

764
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,180
Where is she now?

765
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,560
Lord component mausoleum.

766
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,520
Get up.

767
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,280
Please.

768
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,760
Please...

769
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,200
Please...

770
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,660
There's nothing wrong in having a good relationship.

771
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,380
There's nothing more for boys.

772
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,740
As for the ones behind you,

773
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,620
just leave.

774
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,020
Otherwise,

775
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,860
don't blame me for being rude.

776
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,500
Thank you, ma'am.

777
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,340
Thank you, ma'am.

778
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,460
Thank you, ma'am.

779
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,340
Thank you, ma'am.

780
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,260
Thank you, ma'am.

781
00:32:59,420 --> 00:32:59,980
Li,

782
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,740
what are you doing?

783
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,860
I just gave the food to the people.

784
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,100
I'm just hiding something from the kids.

785
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,060
I drove all the rest away.

786
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,460
I shouldn't have given it to them.

787
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,420
I know we don't have food.

788
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,540
I kept the food.

789
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,340
Besides,

790
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,220
I can eat more on the way.

791
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,540
I'm not talking about this.

792
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,460
No matter how much food I have,

793
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,140
I shouldn't have given it to others.

794
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,580
If I had given them this,

795
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,180
they wouldn't have been able to take it.

796
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,300
Those people have been starving for a long time.

797
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,300
When they come back,

798
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,420
they'll come back in time.

799
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,980
We can't leave.

800
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,820
Don't worry. I'm here.

801
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,820
If anyone dares to do anything,

802
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,780
they won't spare them.

803
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,260
What if they're all dead?

804
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,980
What will you do?

805
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,340
Before the news spreads,

806
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,860
we have to leave now.

807
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,180
I'll let Liu Xun'an send us out of the city.

808
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,020
If the people who are asking for food today

809
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,140
are the people of Huaixiang,

810
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,940
will you still be so cold-hearted?

811
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,580
What does that mean?

812
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,260
I thought you were kind.

813
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,860
To repay the kindness,

814
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,500
you risked your life to save the people of Huaixiang.

815
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,420
But now it doesn't look like that.

816
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,100
You've changed the people of the city.

817
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,220
Your attitude is different.

818
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,860
It's a serious matter.

819
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
What we have to do now

820
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,980
is to rush back to the capital as soon as possible.

821
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,700
We can't let the people of Huaixiang

822
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,980
who are leaving in advance wait for nothing.

823
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,380
Dad,

824
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,100
you always have your own idea.

825
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,460
Just listen to me.

826
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,220
Tong'er.

827
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,620
Dad.

828
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,140
What's wrong?

829
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,700
Relax.

830
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,580
An Li,

831
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,620
be careful after the trip.

832
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,820
If there's any emergency,

833
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,980
contact me at any time.

834
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,500
You promise we'll meet again.

835
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,420
Let's go.

836
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:57,940
Sanjiu,

837
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:58,820
let's go.

838
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,220
Okay.

839
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,540
Now we start toacle.

840
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,300
Go.

841
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,380
Go.

842
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,140
Let's ride this car.

843
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,420
It isYour Highness on the line.

844
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,700
What is Doing?

845
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:26,700
Prepare to try.

846
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,460
Quick,

847
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,680
go on.

848
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,740
Miss Jiua is cheering for us.

849
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,100
What are you doing?

850
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,100
What are you doing?

851
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
Get up!

852
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
Listen to me.

853
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,100
There's no second wife here.

854
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,100
I don't know who she is.

855
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,100
Nonsense.

856
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,100
She's inside.

857
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,100
Yes.

858
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,100
There must be a liver in the city.

859
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,100
Do you want to go?

860
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,100
Is there a liver inside?

861
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Go back.

862
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,100
Go back.

863
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,100
Go back.

864
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,100
Go back.

865
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,100
Go back.

866
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Go back.

867
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Go back.

868
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
Go back.

869
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,100
I'm not polite.

870
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,100
I'm down.

871
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,100
Brother.

872
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,100
Are you okay?

873
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,100
I don't want to go.

874
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,100
I don't want to go.

875
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,100
I don't want to go.

876
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,100
I don't want to go.

877
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,100
I don't want to go.

878
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,100
Who are you guys doing this to?

879
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,100
Brothers, don't listen to him.

880
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,100
We can't starve to death.

881
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,100
There must be a liver inside.

882
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
Go.

883
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,100
Go.

884
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,100
Go.

885
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Go to the wall.

886
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,100
Go to the wall.

887
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Go to the wall.

888
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Go.

889
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Go.

890
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,100
Go.

891
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
It's cold.

892
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,100
Look, it's cold.

893
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
It's a big bag.

894
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
Big bag.

895
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Come on.

896
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,100
Do you have a clue?

897
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,100
Where is it?

898
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,100
Come and see.

899
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
What is this?

900
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
It's a big bag.

901
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,100
Do you have a clue?

902
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,100
It's really a bag.

903
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,100
It's really a bag.

904
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,100
Come on.

905
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,100
Come on.

906
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,100
Come on.

907
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
It's a big bag.

908
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,100
Big bag.

909
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
Come on.

910
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Come on.

911
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,100
Come on.

912
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
It's all here.

913
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,100
Don't think too much.

914
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,100
Okay.

915
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,100
Uncle.

916
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,100
Are you okay?

917
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100
Sister.

918
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
Li.

919
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
You go.

920
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,100
I'll take care of you guys.

921
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Thank you.

922
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,100
It's okay.

923
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,100
Be careful on the way.

924
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,100
I'll take it.

925
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
Give it to me.

926
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,100
No.

927
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,100
No.

928
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,100
Don't.

929
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
Be careful.

930
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
Thank you.

931
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,100
No.

932
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,100
Thank you.

933
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,100
No.

934
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,100
No.

935
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,100
Be careful.

936
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,100
You go.

937
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,100
Be careful.

938
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,100
No.

939
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Thank you.

940
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
We're leaving.

941
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,100
No.

942
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,100
Don't go.

943
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,100
Don't go.

944
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Let's go.

945
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
Go back.

946
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,100
Go back.

947
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,100
No.

948
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,100
No.

949
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,100
I'm leaving.

950
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,100
I'm leaving.

951
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,100
Don't go.

952
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Don't go.

953
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Don't go.

954
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,100
Don't go.

955
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,100
Don't go.

956
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Don't go.

957
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,100
Dad.

958
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,100
You're so stubborn.

959
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,100
Are you tired?

960
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
Do you want to rest?

961
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,100
Do you know

962
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
what the name of the fish is?

963
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
The name is not the official.

964
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
It's all his right.

965
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,100
Dad.

966
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,100
What did you say?

967
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,100
People treat me like

968
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
you treat me like a child.

969
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,100
Dad.

970
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
prejudiced and

971
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,100
gave back what they deserved.

972
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,300
I already convinced

973
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,100
the housekeeper

974
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
to do the task on behalf of us.

975
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
They're my guilty conscience.

976
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
How should we listen?

977
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,100
I don't know

978
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,100
what the people mean.

979
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,100
At this point,

980
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,100
parents are irresponsible.

981
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
All the people

982
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
are

983
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,100
my kid.

984
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,100
No.

985
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,600
Don't do this.

986
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,740
Yes.

987
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,020
Yes.

988
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,700
Then we're not leaving.

989
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,060
We're not leaving?

990
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,020
Go back.

991
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,340
Don't think about it.

992
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,100
Don't forget.

993
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:28,980
Father,

994
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,540
even if you are alreadyungs upward

995
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,660
rest assured you will not

996
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,660
forget your people.

997
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,280
How can those people

998
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,400
hit you?

999
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,720
I will never let them off.

1000
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,940
Li,

1001
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,960
I shouldn't drain my lives

1002
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:49,800
to the people.

1003
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,000
I almost半-sin away

1004
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,800
into the illusion.

1005
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,520
Di Feishi.

1006
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,020
Otherwise,

1007
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,620
my daughter

1008
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,580
and I

1009
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,980
It's not your fault.

1010
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,820
There are some things that I want to say.

1011
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
If the people really do this,

1012
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,300
they will treat us like they are a leader.

1013
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,060
There are people who are afraid of being disloyal.

1014
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,380
They don't want me to leave Dingzhou.

1015
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,540
I heard that

1016
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,540
Dingzhou has many small roads that lead to the outside.

1017
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,980
We can go out through the forest.

1018
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,380
I don't plan to go out.

1019
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,780
What do you think?

1020
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,660
What Sanjiu said before is right.

1021
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,980
They are all people.

1022
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,580
Why do you want to go out?

1023
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,380
My lady.

1024
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,100
They are coming from the outside.

1025
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,980
Thank you for today.

1026
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,980
Why are you here?

1027
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,580
Li Zhongnan is in Dingzhou.

1028
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,100
His Majesty asked me to help him.

1029
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,540
A'Li.

1030
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,060
Jiang Xiangguo has received your letter.

1031
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,060
He is about to go crazy.

1032
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,460
He was going to catch you.

1033
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,020
But he knew that you were going to Dingzhou.

1034
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,180
He asked me to come here to see your situation.

1035
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,660
Father knows that.

1036
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,700
He must be so excited.

1037
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,780
He should let Uncle know.

1038
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,220
So many people.

1039
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,260
So many sins.

1040
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,620
You don't want him to go out.

1041
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,860
How can we solve it?

1042
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:06,780
Right?

1043
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,340
How can we solve it?

1044
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,060
Li Zhongnan is in charge of the disaster.

1045
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,260
The food and food of the disaster are in his hands.

1046
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,900
Even if father wants to help me,

1047
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,260
it's impossible to get Li Zhongnan out.

1048
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,580
Otherwise,

1049
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,300
the crime of preventing disaster

1050
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,780
will be put on father's head.

1051
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,860
If so,

1052
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,180
you still have to go.

1053
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,580
I can't go.

1054
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,780
My heart is already exposed.

1055
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,260
Now Dingzhou's disaster is not solved.

1056
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,260
The people outside the city are not gone.

1057
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,580
I'll take Xue Xinglin out.

1058
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,260
A'Li.

1059
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,940
The road is not far from here.

1060
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,100
How about I go back to the Ye family and think of a way?

1061
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,500
The Ye family has just experienced a disaster.

1062
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,260
The energy is not recovered yet.

1063
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,020
Besides, it's such a short time.

1064
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,780
The food is cold.

1065
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,860
Then the food is transferred here.

1066
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,820
It's impossible.

1067
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,580
Our Ye family has been doing business for decades.

1068
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,220
Of course, it won't be this energy.

1069
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,980
Don't worry.

1070
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,140
I'll go back now.

1071
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,980
Be careful on the way.

1072
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,340
Let's go.

1073
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,860
Thanks.

1074
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,700
If the Ye family can't help us,

1075
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,300
it'll be a dead end.

1076
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,780
Even if it's a dead end,

1077
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,180
we have to die clearly.

1078
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,740
We already know that someone is making a scene behind us.

1079
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,500
At least we have to figure out

1080
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,300
who is behind the scene.

1081
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,580
The dead end is nearby?

1082
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,900
It's just alone here.

1083
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,180
Let's go take the positions.

1084
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,980
Any further projects?

1085
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,820
Let's ask Mr.ice is relevant.

1086
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,500
Let's manage to do the inspection.

1087
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,640
Then he And Group's

1088
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,340
can guide us to his another through the see.

1089
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,620
Okay, let's move along.

1090
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,380
Your connections

1091
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,100
were relatively good.

1092
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,420
We haceed your company to call the job exporter.

1093
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,620
Could you make the decision?

1094
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,620
You're all the people who suffer every day.

1095
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,620
Yes.

1096
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,620
Li Xianguo.

1097
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,620
Li Xianguo.

1098
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,620
What are you doing?

1099
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,620
We've been working for half a generation.

1100
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,620
We've lost a lot of money.

1101
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,620
And we've got the money.

1102
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,620
We just need to make a plan according to the time.

1103
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,620
We need to make a plan according to the time.

1104
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,620
We need to make a plan according to the time.

1105
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,620
We need to make a plan according to the time.

1106
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,620
We need to make a plan according to the time.

1107
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,620
I'm not worried about you.

1108
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,620
After all, this is your family.

1109
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,620
And you're the one who caused the trouble.

1110
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,620
That's not good.

1111
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,620
Dingzhou is the official property of the Nishen.

1112
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,620
If Dingzhou is the dead,

1113
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,620
aren't you afraid that His Majesty will catch you?

1114
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,620
I'm afraid.

1115
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,620
I was afraid before.

1116
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,620
Isn't it that Jiang Erniang is here?

1117
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,620
He took the disaster.

1118
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,620
His Majesty is going to be punished.

1119
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,620
He will be punished.

1120
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,620
He will be punished.

1121
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,620
It has nothing to do with me.

1122
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:51,620
Then you don't care about the people's life?

1123
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,620
That's not true.

1124
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:58,620
In fact, there is a pile of clouds in Dingzhou City.

1125
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,620
But the mountain road is in the area.

1126
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,620
If you want to transport the dead,

1127
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,620
it's not easy.

1128
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,620
You're right.

1129
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,620
If he goes back to the capital alone,

1130
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,620
it's easy.

1131
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,620
But if he wants to bring someone back,

1132
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,620
it's not good to be afraid of the people.

1133
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,620
It's just that the people are in a hurry.

1134
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,620
It's not easy to transport food.

1135
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,620
You mean,

1136
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,620
unless my daughter doesn't bring the people to report the disaster,

1137
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,620
you can solve the problem of the people.

1138
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,620
I didn't say that.

1139
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,620
It's up to you to think about it.

1140
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,620
But in a day,

1141
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,620
there will be more people in Dingzhou City.

1142
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,620
It's dangerous.

1143
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:43,620
I hope that Jiang Xianguo can persuade her daughter.

1144
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,620
But the second wife of Jiang Er

1145
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,620
is not a good person.

1146
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,620
She is a good person.

1147
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,620
The world is in a hurry.

1148
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,620
There is no place to say the truth.

1149
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,620
Right?

1150
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,620
Since their而且 is not deep,

1151
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,620
Lu Yang has to worry.

1152
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,620
Please follow me.

1153
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,620
The island is ahead.

1154
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,620
I will bring you to Great hefted capital.

1155
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,620
Jade pretending.

1156
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,620
Great!

1157
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,620
Your Royal Highness,

1158
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,620
you...

1159
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,620
Well said.

1160
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,620
writes.

1161
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,840
Do you oder keep aroots?

1162
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,700
No, I'll give you two a

1163
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,980
little skill.

1164
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,880
Isn't it my Duke who gave me a skill from an older未?

1165
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,040
Understood.

1166
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,060
You say it from the first person who warned me.

1167
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,880
So I can tell the two things and swap them on.

1168
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,860
Then goes Choose The King?

1169
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,520
But how could He Begin?

1170
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:57,560
His dear inheritors left nothing but썹

1171
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,660
All his parents or elders of Jin State

1172
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,100
have been left only for himself.

1173
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,140
Right now,

1174
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,740
you can be called a bow granting separation

1175
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:26,240
without letting its

1176
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,260
GAI to enter

1177
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,800
the Space whole life.

1178
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
I'm not happy.

1179
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,800
