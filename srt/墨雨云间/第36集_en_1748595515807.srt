1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
When spring comes, the clouds will return to the earth

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The moon knows all my efforts

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regrets

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm still lonely

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm still lonely

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm still lonely

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm still lonely

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm still lonely

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm still lonely

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regrets

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm still lonely

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm still lonely

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm still lonely

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm still lonely

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm still lonely

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm still lonely

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm still lonely

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm still lonely

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm still lonely

31
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He's so dizzy

32
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He's so dizzy

33
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Please have a drink with Princess Fu Ma

34
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Fu Ma

35
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Interesting

36
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're so annoying

37
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How dare you to fall in my wine?

38
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Mei Xiang

39
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm tired

40
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes

41
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Fu Ma

42
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Can't you hear me?

43
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm still lonely

44
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm still lonely

45
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm still lonely

46
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm still lonely

47
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm still lonely

48
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm still lonely

49
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm still lonely

50
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm still lonely

51
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm still lonely

52
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm still lonely

53
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm still lonely

54
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Being alone in the world

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I've known you for a while

56
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We went through a good time together

57
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I've entrusted my life to you

58
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I've been in love with you for a long time

59
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm so afraid of losing you

60
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,760
It's like all the stars빡 the moon in drops,

61
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,220
will never be afraid of the stars.

62
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,760
Here's my tea, which tastes like Yifan consciously.

63
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,560
This is a lau shot of Yifan.

64
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,100
It wants it too.

65
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,100
Try it.

66
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,920
Hold on.

67
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,920
I heard that His Majesty has given marriage to the eldest princess and the eldest prince.

68
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,920
What are your plans?

69
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Can you still be the consort?

70
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,920
The consort is just a risk. Is it that important?

71
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
What do you mean?

72
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Let's eat.

73
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,920
How is it? Are you feeling better?

74
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Sister, don't always come to see me.

75
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
I'm still alive.

76
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,920
I'm very jealous to see you and father.

77
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
I don't just want to save you.

78
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
I want you to live well.

79
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Sister, I'm sorry.

80
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
I'm sorry.

81
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Sister, I heard from the mansion that the eldest princess has married.

82
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Is it true?

83
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Yes.

84
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
You didn't marry Shen Yurong?

85
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
This is part of my plan.

86
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,920
In short, everything is progressing in the right direction.

87
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
That's great.

88
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
After your plan is successful,

89
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
I still want to go back to Huai Xiang with you.

90
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,920
I also want to go see Qiong Zhi.

91
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,920
I don't know if his debt is still in return.

92
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Do you still remember Qiong Zhi?

93
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Of course.

94
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Maybe he has forgotten me.

95
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
He still remembers you.

96
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,920
When I went to Lu Yang, he told me that my father was still alive.

97
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
How did you go back to him?

98
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,920
When I just arrived at Lu Yang, I didn't know where to go.

99
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
So I remembered him.

100
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
He thanked you for helping him.

101
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,920
He went to the desert and asked about the whereabouts of his father.

102
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Did he ask you why I didn't go to him after that?

103
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,920
He knew that after your death, he was not able to bear to live.

104
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
How is he now?

105
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,920
He married a good man.

106
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,920
He went to a faraway place.

107
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,920
He will never have any one to bully him again.

108
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Okay. He's fine.

109
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
He's fine now.

110
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
And he didn't forget me.

111
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I'm satisfied.

112
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
The medicine is ready.

113
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Zhao, whose medicine are you giving him?

114
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
He's so considerate.

115
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
My new lover.

116
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,920
When we first met, I was still a woman.

117
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
He probably was very disappointed with me.

118
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,920
So he never took care of me.

119
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,920
He married a good man.

120
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,920
He went to a faraway place.

121
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,920
He will never have any one to bully him again.

122
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
You look good today.

123
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
You got a big one.

124
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Xiao Heng, I'll give you a meal.

125
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
How long do you want to catch it?

126
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,920
I'm almost dead.

127
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,920
How long? I'm almost dead.

128
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Let's go.

129
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Thank you for coming with me today.

130
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
It's hard for you to say thank you.

131
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
What?

132
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
You don't need to say thank you to that A-Li?

133
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
You're still angry.

134
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
I'm angry with him?

135
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
He didn't bother me.

136
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Besides, even if I'm angry,

137
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
will you still be angry with me?

138
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
No.

139
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Then that's fine.

140
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,920
When are you leaving?

141
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Tomorrow.

142
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
You didn't make it, did you?

143
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
My brother is too hard on you.

144
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
I didn't.

145
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
I just mentioned some conditions.

146
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
After I returned to Dazhao in September,

147
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
I didn't think much of it.

148
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
It seemed like I was a different person.

149
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,920
But after you came here,

150
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
he seemed to have come back alive.

151
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
I don't care about the thoughts of my little girl.

152
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Even if I'm in the rain,

153
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
I can't find out.

154
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Xiao Heng, you know that

155
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,920
I only have a family in this world,

156
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
I want him to be fine.

157
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
What do you mean?

158
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,920
He Qing, I hope you can come to Dazhao as a father.

159
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
You're the father of the late Emperor,

160
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,920
and you're my sister in September.

161
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
As long as you have a marriage,

162
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
then we're a family.

163
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,920
It's not as reliable as this.

164
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,920
It's the marriage anniversary in September.

165
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
As far as I know,

166
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Duke Su is not married yet.

167
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Plus the situation of Dazhao and Yan.

168
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,920
I think it's a perfect match.

169
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,920
What did you say?

170
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
I said it.

171
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Of course, it depends on your opinion.

172
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
If I say it...

173
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
Jiuyue,

174
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
now the emperor is in the main court,

175
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
and Prince Cheng is in a different position.

176
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Prince Cheng is also a good man.

177
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Even if he gets the Great Yan,

178
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
he won't be too shy.

179
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
If he gets the Great Yan and Dazhao,

180
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
he will come back.

181
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Stop, stop.

182
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
You know that.

183
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,920
I don't understand.

184
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
What do I want to hear?

185
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
You should know it.

186
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Okay, I'll tell you directly.

187
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
First, I must see the soldiers.

188
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,920
Second, I can't agree to it.

189
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Third, if you don't agree to it,

190
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
I'll wait for death.

191
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
What did you say?

192
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,920
Of course, you should refuse your brother.

193
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
I'll do it.

194
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
No wonder you came back to accompany me.

195
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
I didn't have any good intentions.

196
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
I really have a bad taste.

197
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
Why do you like such a rude person?

198
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
I'm rude when I'm a fake.

199
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Am I not good?

200
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
Forget it.

201
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,920
I'll wait for death.

202
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
You come back.

203
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Last time,

204
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
after that,

205
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,920
it's okay for you to die.

206
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Get out.

207
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Get out.

208
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Get out.

209
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Father.

210
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Father.

211
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
What's wrong?

212
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
The princess said

213
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,920
she would feel bad if she was hurt.

214
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Go on.

215
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Yes.

216
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Prince Wu,

217
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:34,200
hear me

218
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,200
It's all because my mother asked me to prepare it for you.

219
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
There are many kinds of food.

220
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
You don't like normal food,

221
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
but you don't like it.

222
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
You don't like it, do you?

223
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,200
The taste of human is different.

224
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
I feel disgusting.

225
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,200
You want to eat it?

226
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
No.

227
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,200
I'll order them to prepare some new food and taste.

228
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
And send it to you.

229
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Is it delicious?

230
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Yes.

231
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Hai Tong, how is it?

232
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
My wife.

233
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Sister.

234
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Zhou.

235
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Sit down.

236
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Why you are out?

237
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
State Prince Su is back.

238
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
I want to greet him, too.

239
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
I've been looking after him for a long time in the State Prince's Manor.

240
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
I'm so tired.

242
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
My father's condition is getting better.

243
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
He even called me out for a call today.

244
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
I'm getting tired of it.

245
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,200
It seems that Li Xue's day is over.

246
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
What's wrong?

247
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Where are you going?

248
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
The food is ready.

249
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
We can eat it later.

250
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,200
We won't disturb you and your brother-in-law.

251
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Coming.

252
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
You...

253
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
I'm going to eat the food.

254
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Who are you?

255
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Who are you?

256
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Let me ask you.

257
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I'm Jiang Jiang Erniangzi, Jiang Li.

258
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Jiang Jia?

259
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Jiang Wu Gui, right?

260
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Jiang Wu Gui?

261
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Yes.

262
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,200
It's nothing to do with the head and the head.

263
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
But she's a good girl.

264
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
She's very gentle.

265
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
I'm going to pick you up.

266
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Why didn't you wait for me?

267
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,200
I'm just here to visit the Palace of State.

268
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Can't I come to my grandson's place?

269
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
You misunderstood.

270
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Our main emperor hasn't come back yet.

271
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I thought I'd tell you when he's here.

272
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
What?

273
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
You're here to wait for me?

274
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
You don't want to see me, do you?

275
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
I don't want to see him.

276
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
I've had two bowls of soup.

277
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
You can stay and drink.

278
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
I'm going.

279
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
You're the general Xiao Da Chuan,

280
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,200
who helped the late emperor fight the war.

281
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
General Xiao.

282
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Listen.

283
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Listen.

284
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
This girl.

285
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
She's sweet and nice.

286
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
I love her.

287
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Let's go.

288
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Let's go home.

289
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I'll take you home.

290
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Master, you're back.

291
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
I'll take you to the palace later.

292
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
I said don't let the late emperor come in.

293
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
This...

294
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
You're in a d接age.

295
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Well, you're home.

296
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
No, thanks.

297
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
We'll take them out anyhow.

298
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
General Xiao Da Chuan...

299
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
I know.

300
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,200
He gives me wife every year.

301
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Why?

302
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Are you sure we haven't seen each other for so long?

303
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
You're the first one to tell me about the matter of me and Song Jiuren.

304
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
What's so fragrant in the yard?

305
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,200
It's the roast meat prepared by Xue Zhao and Begonia.

306
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
It's for the Duke of Su.

307
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
The Zhao people don't want to take the troops?

308
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
They do.

309
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
It's just...

310
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
They want me to go to the Great Zhao.

311
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Really?

312
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Are you done?

313
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Yes.

314
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
I promised you I'd come.

315
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
You didn't.

316
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
I'll find you a piece of horse.

317
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Li,

318
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,200
do you really want me to be your father?

319
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Duke of Su is joking.

320
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
I don't dare to make your decision.

321
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
If I promise you,

322
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
you won't spare me.

323
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Why?

324
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
I know.

325
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Do you still know that Wanning married Li Jinjia?

326
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Is this different from your plan?

327
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
It's a bit different.

328
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
But it's a surprise.

329
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Li Jinjia is a very proud person.

330
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,200
He must be upset every day.

331
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Now Li's family is in a bad mood.

332
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Actually, he's in a bad mood.

333
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,200
It's time to see who will lose the pot.

334
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
It's beautiful.

335
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
It's the same as the Duke of Su.

336
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
What about the Great Zhao?

337
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Are you sure?

338
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
I used other methods to lead the troops.

339
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Now there's no more stock.

340
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
I'll wait for the right time

341
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
to wait for Yu'er to come in.

342
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Shen,

343
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I found some ancient books

344
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
in the Western Qi grassland.

345
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,200
I also put the book in the place where it is.

346
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Okay, I see.

347
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
You can tell me if you need anything.

348
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Master,

349
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
the soldiers of the Imperial City Bureau

350
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,200
have already sent a copy of the border

351
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
according to your instructions.

352
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
But someone wants to live

353
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
and provides the warning.

354
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
He's in charge of

355
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
managing the Imperial City Bureau's military stock.

356
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
I heard from the private private opinion

357
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
that the three months before the Imperial City Bureau

358
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
led to the transfer of the troops

359
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
to the forestry tree.

360
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
But the part that was transferred

361
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
didn't go into his hands.

362
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
The military stock was released in unison.

363
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
It's not accurate to say

364
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
that the five stock numbers were reported

365
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
by the military intelligence.

366
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
I'll go and check it out.

367
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
I'll send the document to the five stock numbers.

368
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
I'll send it to the market.

369
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
If it's taken from the super-evil forestry

370
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
and it's not in the stock,

371
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
it means that the part that was transferred

372
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
was taken by Prince Cheng.

373
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Prince Cheng has been buying horses recently.

374
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
The military stock is the control of the military.

375
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
It seems that the Imperial City Bureau

376
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
is not only not giving the emperor a door,

377
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
but also helping Prince Cheng to get the military stock.

378
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
So you even have the five stock numbers

379
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
except for the thief.

380
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
I checked it out.

381
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
The five stock numbers are responsible for

382
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
the military stock used by the Imperial City Bureau.

383
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Chief,

384
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
do you want to go to the five stock numbers?

385
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Go to the family of the thief.

386
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Yes.

387
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Xiao Gu.

388
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
You're so lucky.

389
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Xiao Gu.

390
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Xiao Gu.

391
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Xiao Gu, you're so lucky.

392
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Xiao Gu.

393
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
What's wrong with you?

394
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
They're playing with you

395
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
for the suicide.

396
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Xiao Gu.

397
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
There are some marks here.

398
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
What did the robber burn before he committed suicide?

399
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
The number of the robber

400
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
is the same as the number of the imperial city bureau.

401
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
The Noble God and the Imperial Army are not in the military.

402
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
But they didn't take the military stock

403
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
to the place.

404
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
They're all the lies made by the imperial guards.

405
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Duke Su.

406
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Chief, the five stock numbers are the imperial numbers.

407
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
The imperial numbers?

408
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
The news is quite clear.

409
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,200
You're here to cover the summer.

410
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Duke Su, don't be ridiculous.

411
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
I just got the information.

412
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
I came here in a hurry.

413
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Your subordinates

414
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
colluded with the imperial city bureau to buy military stock.

415
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Do you know how to do it?

416
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Of course not.

417
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
The military stock of the imperial guards

418
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
is made by the city of Shu.

419
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
And the city of Shu

420
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
is the one responsible for the city of Shu.

421
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
I didn't expect that

422
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
the imperial city bureau would buy it.

423
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
In addition to the imperial city bureau,

424
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
which family else is the imperial army sent by the imperial army?

425
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
It should be the imperial army of the guards.

426
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
So,

427
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
the imperial army of the guards

428
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
is responsible for the military stock.

429
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
I just got the information.

430
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
All the imperial guards

431
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
who put the body of the imperial guards in the summer

432
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
and the imperial city bureau

433
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
took it away.

434
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
They said that they thought it was a problem.

435
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
They wanted to know the truth.

436
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
It seems that the fire powder

437
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
should be the ones that burned it.

438
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
The imperial guards

439
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
went to the five stock numbers to buy the military stock.

440
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Is there any evidence to keep it?

441
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Yes.

442
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Every time the military stock is sold out,

443
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
the five stock numbers

444
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
will be recorded.

445
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Wenji,

446
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
you go with the imperial guards

447
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
and get the records of the imperial guards.

448
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Yes.

449
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Commander Huang, please.

450
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Master,

451
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
you suspect that the imperial guards are thinking about...

452
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Since there is a problem in the stock,

453
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
we should investigate it.

454
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
We can change it later.

455
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Do you want to say hello to the general?

456
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
After all,

457
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
the imperial guards in the imperial city bureau

458
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
were sent by Zhang Wei.

459
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I don't even know the emperor.

460
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Why should I report to him?

461
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Yes.

462
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Your Highness.

463
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Where are you going?

464
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Do I need to report to you?

465
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,200
I'll stay with you.

466
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Are you going to monitor me?

467
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
No.

468
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
I'm afraid that if you go out,

469
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
I'm afraid that if the child

470
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
has an accident,

471
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
we might not be able to take it.

472
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
How dare you curse me?

473
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Since you don't want to be with me,

474
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
I won't beg you.

475
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
I just hope that you can

476
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
recover soon.

477
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
I found out that the stock market is not in stock.

478
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
I heard that in the capital,

479
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
you've seen many things in the capital.

480
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
So I'm wondering if you can help me find

481
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
this medicine.

482
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
If I can find it,

483
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
I'll be rewarded.

484
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Don't worry, Senior Shen.

485
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Don't worry.

486
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,200
I'll do my best to find it.

487
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Brother.

488
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Princess Zhang is here.

489
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
If you need anything,

490
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
just tell Yu Long to go.

491
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
He'll come home personally.

492
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
This is to make our Shen family

493
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
happy.

494
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

495
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Madam Shen.

496
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
I have something to discuss with the Shen School.

497
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
I hope no one will bother me.

498
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Yes.

499
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
I also hope that

500
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
no one will know

501
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
about my visit to the Shen family.

502
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Princess Zhang has never been to the Shen family.

503
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Let's go, Shen School.

504
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
I'll go.

505
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Please.

506
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
You just came to Li's home.

507
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
It's hard to avoid the rumors.

508
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,200
Rumors?

509
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
I've heard about your arrangement.

510
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Are you afraid of Consort Yan?

511
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
I'm just worried that

512
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Young Master Li's nephew

513
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
will be a threat to me.

514
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Then we should see

515
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
if he has the guts.

516
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
He's fine.

517
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
It's you.

518
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Hua Youshen is still out.

519
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
If anything happens,

520
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
what should I do?

521
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Don't worry.

522
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
I'm fine now.

523
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,200
But I'll stay in Li's home.

524
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
It's a threat.

525
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
You're bullied in Li's home?

526
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
He dares to.

527
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
But I'm not good at anything

528
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
in Li's home.

529
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
I'm almost dead.

530
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
You're angry again, aren't you?

531
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
I just fell for a few nights.

532
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Li's family

533
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
dares to look at me.

534
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
What's that?

535
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
You're in trouble.

536
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
You know I'm in trouble.

537
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
You're not taking me away.

538
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
The day of the city's death

539
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
is when we're engaged.

540
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
But I want to remind you.

541
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
No one will treat you like I do.

542
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
So you should practice your temper.

543
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Don't force Li Jingduo.

544
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,200
He's also a student of the capital.

545
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
He didn't suffer this kind of grievance.

546
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
For the sake of the child,

547
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
you should take care of the whole neighborhood.

548
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
It's the most important

549
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
to live a peaceful life.

550
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Okay, okay. I get it.

551
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
I'll take it.

552
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
I'll take it.

553
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Shen Lang.

554
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
What's the name of our child?

555
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
You're in the name.

556
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
I hope that she can

557
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
be as peaceful and peaceful

558
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,200
as snow.

559
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Shen.

560
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Ning.

561
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Xue.

562
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Shen.

563
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Ning.

564
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Xue.

565
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Xue.

566
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
I'll change her name.

567
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Xue.

568
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Okay.

569
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
As long as you listen to me,

570
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
our Xue

571
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
will be healthy and mature.

572
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Duke Su, please come in.

573
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
What's the matter?

574
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,200
Nothing.

575
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
I can't come here to sit.

576
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Of course you're welcome.

577
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
But I think you've been busy

578
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
with the case of the Imperial City.

579
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
You don't have time to come here.

580
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
I didn't think that

581
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,200
you'd only care about the case of the Imperial City.

582
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
This is a matter

583
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
that involves Princess Dazhao and Yu Ci'an.

584
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
It's hard to care about

585
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
all the things in the capital.

586
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,200
I heard that

587
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
you've been in the dark for a minute.

588
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
You're in the dark?

589
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
You're not in the dark?

590
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
We found that

591
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
the Imperial City's men

592
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
bought the weapons

593
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
that were responsible for the Shen He's army.

594
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
They took the weapons

595
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
from the weapons

596
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
and sold them to the Imperial City.

597
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
What's going on?

598
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
This is the Imperial City's army

599
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,200
that is responsible for the Shen He's army.

600
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
It turns out

601
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
you can guess

602
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
who he's responsible for

603
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
when he comes in.

604
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Duke Su, don't worry.

605
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
We're all the soldiers

606
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
who are in charge of the army.

607
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
No matter how much we're in charge of the army,

608
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
no matter how much we're in charge of the army,

609
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
we'll never be able to return to the Imperial City.

610
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
I've got the order from the army

611
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:25,600
to record the

612
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,200
Shen He's army.

613
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
If there's nothing wrong with it,

614
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
I want to examine the Shen He's army.

615
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
It's a fair process.

616
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
It's my duty.

617
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Xu Zhi.

618
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Greetings, Duke Su.

619
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
There are some problems with Uncle Wu.

620
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
He wants to check my army.

621
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
You should cooperate with him.

622
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Yes, Duke Su.

623
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Please.

624
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Guards.

625
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Send a message to General Xiao.

626
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Tell him I want to ask him to cooperate.

627
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Yes.

628
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Duke Su, please.

629
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
This is the Holy Spirit Book

630
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
that we send to the army

631
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
to collect military letters.

632
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
This is the letter we send to the army

633
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
to return to the Imperial City.

634
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
Le Ji.

635
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Yes.

636
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Each letter has two parts.

637
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
One is the Holy Spirit Book

638
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
and the other is my private treasure.

639
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
The record of the letter

640
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
that I've got from the Holy Spirit Book

641
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
is all on this map.

642
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Can I keep these letters?

643
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Just take them.

644
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,200
But you can't use them.

645
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Please return them to me.

646
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Master.

647
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
This looks like a water drop on the surface.

648
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
It's like a rehearsal.

649
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
That Cao Bin is in a hurry to burn the book.

650
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
We can't send the letter

651
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
that the Imperial Army sent to the Imperial City

652
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
to collect military letters.

653
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
But the first-person record

654
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
is not good enough.

655
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
That means...

656
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
I've got the super-evil letter

657
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
but I've got the record.

658
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Master.

659
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
The Imperial Army of the Imperial City

660
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
of Wukushu

661
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
found that the military letters

662
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
produced during the military period

663
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
were actually the military letters

664
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
that were in the super-evil letter.

665
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
It means that Cao Bin

666
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
did get the record

667
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
from the Imperial Army

668
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
and got the super-evil letter.

669
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
No need to worry.

670
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Take that letter to me.

671
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Yes.

672
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Why did Xiao Hang

673
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
go to the Imperial Army of the Imperial City

674
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,200
to investigate the case?

675
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Isn't this the case of the Imperial Army of the Imperial City?

676
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
He found out that

677
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
the Imperial Army of Wukushu

678
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
was in the prison

679
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
and was in the military.

680
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
So he suspected

681
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
that my death was also a case.

682
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
General.

683
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
You know

684
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
about Duke Su's letter.

685
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
He's certain

686
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
that even if he's

687
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
going to dig out

688
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
the third-person record

689
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,200
and the method of using it

690
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
is also a one-shot.

691
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
So I...

692
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
You're asking me

693
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
whether I can use it

694
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
to find out the truth

695
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
or not?

696
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
I don't think so.

697
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
I don't want him to continue to investigate.

698
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
No.

699
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
I'm not afraid

700
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
of anyone investigating.

701
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
But the case

702
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
has to be proven.

703
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,200
If you don't have any evidence

704
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
and you just arrest

705
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
my men

706
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
I won't be afraid of anyone.

707
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
General mentioned it to me.

708
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,200
So I thought about it.

709
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,200
I have to inform you

710
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
about it

711
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
in advance

712
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,200
so that you won't misunderstand.

713
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
If he comes in trouble,

714
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
I won't let him off.

715
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
I'm relieved

716
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,200
that you have the word.

717
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
Where did you go

718
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
so late at night?

719
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
I...

720
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
No one will treat you

721
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,200
like I do.

722
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
So you have to take your temper.

723
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Don't force Li Jing.

724
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
She's also

725
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
a child of the Tang Dynasty.

726
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
You have to take care of her.

727
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
I'll go to the Palace of the Princess

728
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
and pack up some things.

729
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
The Palace of the Princess

730
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
and the Shen Yu Rong family

731
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
are in two directions.

732
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I remember it in two directions.

733
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
You followed me?

734
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Your Highness is still

735
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
my wife in the Ming Dynasty.

736
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
You just go to

737
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
another man's house

738
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
with such a big waist.

739
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
If anyone sees you

740
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
I'll ask you

741
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
what should I do?

742
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Li Jing.

743
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Don't be so weird

744
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
to talk to me.

745
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
I married you.

746
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
You're Li's wife.

747
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,200
We're a kind of cooperation.

748
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
If you help me sincerely,

749
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
I'll reward you with more.

750
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
If you find me a tea here,

751
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
I'm sorry.

752
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
I'll find you a house

753
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
at any time.

754
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
It's a deal.

755
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,200
How dare I find a tea?

756
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
I just want to protect

757
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
the Princess

758
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
and your child.

759
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
After all, you and Shen Yu Rong's matter,

760
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
if it's spread out,

761
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
everyone can see it.

762
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
What is he doing?

763
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
If it wasn't for my child,

764
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
I would have killed your dog.

765
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Your Highness, please calm down.

766
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
The child is important.

767
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
I don't want him to

768
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
even think about me.

769
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Hello, Xu Zhi.

770
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
It's you.

771
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
What are you doing?

772
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Didn't I give you all the hard-working books?

773
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
You can go to the Qingtian

774
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
and the Begonia.

775
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
You think you're a self-proclaimed man?

776
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
You burned some books

777
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
and made a way out of them.

778
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
We can't find out.

779
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
I didn't take them.

780
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
I didn't steal them.

781
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
We've checked

782
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
the Begonia.

783
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
It's the army

784
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
that you're serving.

785
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
Why didn't you say

786
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
they sold them?

787
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Good.

788
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,200
You're not saying anything.

789
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Then don't blame me

790
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
for not keeping the love.

791
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,200
No.

792
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
No.

793
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
No.

794
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
No.

795
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
Master.

796
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
How is Shen?

797
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
He's still not here.

798
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
He'll be here tomorrow.

799
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Keep it up.

800
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
I can't wait for tomorrow.

801
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
Yes.

802
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Report!

803
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
The guards in Qingyuan are

804
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Zhang Wei and the soldiers

805
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
in the Imperial Palace.

806
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
What's the meaning of

807
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
the commanding of the capital?

808
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
You shouldn't

809
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
bring so many people

810
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
to the guest room.

811
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Guest room?

812
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
I haven't

813
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
had that relationship with

814
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Duke Su.

815
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
He's taken my people

816
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
and I don't have any

817
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,200
explanation.

818
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
I'll give you

819
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,200
a time-lapse

820
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
and hand them out.

821
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
If I don't hand them out,

822
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
then try it.

823
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Don't move!

824
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
What's going on?

825
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Zhang Wei.

826
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
General.

827
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,200
I told you before.

828
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
If he doesn't come in,

829
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
I'll have to do it.

830
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
You must hand out

831
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
my people today.

832
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,200
It's just a joke.

833
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
I'm not afraid

834
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Xu Zhi will bring you out.

835
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
You!

836
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
Don't move!

837
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,200
Don't move!

838
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Don't move!

839
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Don't move!

840
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,200
Zhao Wei.

841
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Give me a face.

842
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,200
I promise

843
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
I'll give you a chance

844
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
within a day.

845
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
General.

846
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Please.

847
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Retreat!

848
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,200
Let go of the man.

849
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,200
He's a personal guard.

850
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,200
He's a personal guard.

851
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
You can't do anything.

852
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
I'm in charge of His Majesty's order.

853
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
You've already heard it,

854
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
grandson.

855
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
He's a personal guard.

856
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
He's a personal guard.

857
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
He's a personal guard.

858
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
I'll send

859
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Xu Zhi to the San Ya Beast City

860
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
myself.

861
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
You can do it with them.

862
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
You can't do it without a personal guard.

863
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
You can't do it without a personal guard.

864
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
This matter...

865
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
I'll send you

866
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
to the San Ya Beast City

867
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
to see if it's related to you.

868
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,200
Go.

869
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Tell me.

870
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,200
What's the matter?

871
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,200
You've grown up

872
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
after a few years.

873
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
You're so helpless.

874
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
My father died

875
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
eight years ago.

876
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
You didn't even get to see him.

877
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Now I want to find out

878
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
who you're talking to

879
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
and why you're here to save me.

880
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,200
What's the point?

881
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Your father's death is an accident.

882
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Let him go first.

883
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Tell me.

884
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
I've lost my home.

885
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Close the door.

886
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
I'm sorry.

887
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,200
I'm sorry.

888
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,200
I'm sorry.

889
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200
I'm sorry.

890
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
I'm sorry.

891
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,200
I'm sorry.

892
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,200
I'm sorry.

893
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,200
You do it yourself.

894
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,200
You can't change your attitude

895
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
when you're caught

896
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
by a private officer.

897
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,200
Four-leaf clover is forbidden.

898
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,200
You can't see

899
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
the culture of your two bones.

900
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,200
If you can't control it,

901
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,200
that's the end of this.

902
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,200
Why didn't you tell me

903
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,240
You have to give up.

904
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,840
You don't learn from your old general.

905
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,200
It seems that he has his own book here.

906
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,160
Yes, he has.

907
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,880
The only book for you to beg for

908
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,600
is about Zhang Wei's case in your State Palace.

909
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,920
What is the current situation in the capital?

910
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,960
Many people are worried about you.

911
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,280
Without evidence, you can arrest people and use your soul.

912
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,400
There is a risk.

913
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,400
Now,

914
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,080
the new enemies of the Imperial Guards

915
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,560
are all coming up.

916
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,360
They are all praising you.

917
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,800
How can you be so sure?

918
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,800
Isn't it good?

919
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,160
His Majesty can see

920
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,400
the party's order in the court.

921
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,560
You are so stubborn.

922
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,400
Let them go first.

923
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,640
Let them rest for a few days.

924
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,800
How can I rest in this kind of situation?

925
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,680
You should rest when you are like this.

926
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,320
You are so stubborn.

927
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,520
You are so stubborn.

928
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,320
You should take a rest.

929
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,960
I have sent the imperial decree.

930
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,800
I order you to stay at home for two days.

931
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,720
I have sent the imperial decree.

932
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,920
I have sent the imperial decree.

933
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,120
I have sent the imperial decree.

934
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,320
I have sent the imperial decree.

935
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,640
I have sent the imperial decree.

936
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,840
I have sent the imperial decree.

937
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,160
I have sent the imperial decree.

938
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,520
I have sent the imperial decree.

939
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,720
I have sent the imperial decree.

940
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,920
I have sent the imperial decree.

941
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,320
