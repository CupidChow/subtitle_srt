1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And I don't want to lose

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm slowly struggling to hide my pain

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've walked through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Waiting for the spring to return to the earth

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 1

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I came to find Qiong Zhi's wife

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I have something to ask

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What?

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I know your lover?

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Maybe

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I know your lover

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't even know if I have a lover

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The son of the county magistrate

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Xue Zhao

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I didn't expect Duke Su to be so polite

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What are you doing?

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You've seen my body

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I can't see you

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I like you

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What did you eat just now?

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Nanzhang Valley

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If I don't have a sister

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll have blood in a month

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Who are you?

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm Zhao's friend

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Jiang Li

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I've pressed her down

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Send her to the basement

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Help

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Be honest

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Help

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Go

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Help

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Help

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Help

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Go

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let go

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're a beautiful woman

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you have any ideas?

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Who are you?

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't worry

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I owe you money

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've said it

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll pay you back every month

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I won't take it

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You owe me 50 taels

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If you don't pay me back

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll ask who you want

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll pay you back

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I've said it

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why do you have to force me?

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's none of your business

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Go

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Did you know?

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll pay you back

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I know

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I know

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
She owes you money

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll pay you back in the future

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If you harass her again

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll be in trouble

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll pay you back

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes, I'll pay you back

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll pay you back

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll pay you back

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Go

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Are you okay?

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you know how to live with your son?

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Those people are not dead

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll come to Lu Yang's house every day

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If they dare to do it again

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll help you to take care of them

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I thought he was just saying

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I didn't expect

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
he would come to visit me every day

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
At that time

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
he would always wear several clothes

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
before he came to Lu Yang's house

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
until he was satisfied

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You seem to be very close to him

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
A Zhou's sister is my friend

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
A Zhou's sister told me

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What are you doing?

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're so ugly

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Forget it

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll do it again

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So many

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Who are you giving this to?

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're so considerate

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
My sweetheart

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They give you names

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
for your guests

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Why are you still engraving your own?

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I engraved my own name on it

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So he can remember me when he sees it

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
When we first met

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I was still a Liang's daughter

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But now

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
he probably feels very disappointed with me

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So he never looked at me

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He never looked at me

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He didn't want to see you

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
but he died

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Xue Zhao was on the way to the capital

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and was killed by the robbers

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What was the point?

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Not only that

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Xue's family was separated

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
His father and his sister

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
were all dead

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
An Zhao

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Within six months

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Xue's family was separated

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
There must be something wrong

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
in this

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I came here

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to ask you

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
if you know anything

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
is the last time

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Xue's family saw me

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
as a gift

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
There are ten silver coins

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He said

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
if the debtor

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
works less

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
he would use this silver

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to pay the price

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But those people

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
never appeared in Xue's family

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and never succeeded

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
How could they see

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
the letter?

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
How could they see the letter?

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Have you seen this?

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's see if they know each other

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This is what Zhao put in the silver

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't understand

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
what you said

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But the letter

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
is the letter

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
of Zhao

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I kept it

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and never showed it to anyone

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He left it to you

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Keep it

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
My dear

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Is there anything I can do for you?

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This Xihua House

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
is the most important

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
in Lu Yang's family

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You can ask me

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
about Lu Yang's case

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I want to ask Qiong's wife

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
to help me

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Huai Xiang County

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Xue Huai Yuan

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
died half a year ago

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Who is the heir of the family?

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Where is he buried?

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's the love

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
between me and Xue's family

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is what I found

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't help it

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll call

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
your family name

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
My dear

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Where is Zhao's

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
home?

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The heir of Xue's family

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
will return to Gu Xiang

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
in the capital

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
when they

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
return to Gu Xiang

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll let them go

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll tell you two ways

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
First, go to Chu Lan

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Second,

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
join me

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Join me?

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll help you

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
to get Chu Lan out

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're more interesting

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If I help you

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Will you come often?

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll see your performance

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll help you

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Thank you

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Duke Su

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Why are you here?

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The investigation

201
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What a coincidence

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I came to Lu Yang

203
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You came to Lu Yang's investigation

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You want to say

205
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm following you again?

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You left so soon

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Your things are gone

208
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Such a delicate jade pendant

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
was left to Wuland

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It seems I misunderstood

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You're here to do the case

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sorry

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll go now

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Li

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Li

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It seems you don't want to work with me

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's normal for a young lady to be jealous

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Just explain it

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Just be jealous

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Be jealous?

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll spare you this time

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If there's anything else

223
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't mind working with someone else

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Sister, I was wandering in front of the door

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I saw Duke Su here

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
How is he?

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
How is he?

228
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I have nothing to do with him

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
My lady, this is the account book of this month

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Forget it

231
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's all in my head

232
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Li Zhengtang sold 921 pieces of it

233
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's 1353 pieces

234
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The income is more than the month

235
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's a whole increase

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But from the front

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's good

238
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But when I first entered Hanqiu

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It was the time of Tianxin Yi

240
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The autumn clothes were more expensive than the summer clothes

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
If you look at the general account

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's a big loss

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
My lady, don't forget it

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Madam is still waiting for you in the room

245
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's go

246
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Mother, I'm back

247
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Mother

248
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Mother

249
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Mother

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What's wrong with you?

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Your mother

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Mother

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This time I'm back

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I brought a little smoke fire

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Mother

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm back

257
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm back

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Take care of my mother

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll ask my father now

260
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't worry

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'll do it

262
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Father

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What's wrong with you?

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What's wrong?

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Little wild fox

266
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What little wild fox

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You brought it back

268
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You asked me

269
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I brought it back

270
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Little wild fox

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You said it was Li

272
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Look, look

273
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's so close

274
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's not a little wild fox

275
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You said this little wild fox

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Is our relative

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Jiang Jia Li

278
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, look at our Ye family's shop

279
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Father

280
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What's wrong with our family?

281
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Why did you bring such a big trouble back?

282
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
How to talk

283
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
How to talk

284
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He is the future of the country

285
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's also your cousin

286
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Little wild fox

287
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You entered the big gate of the Ye family

288
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You said it

289
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Father

290
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You solved the problem of the eyes first

291
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You let me die

292
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Little wild fox

293
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You entered the big gate of the Ye family

294
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Ye family is mine

295
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Win

296
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Madam, you can't go

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Let me go

298
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This family has a little wild fox

299
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Not me

300
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't have that little wild fox

301
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm not for you

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I owe the wild prince

303
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What are you doing

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I don't

305
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Madam

306
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Even if you die

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We have to say it clearly

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't want to live

309
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Shut up

310
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What you said

311
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's not a little wild fox

312
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's our foreign girl, Jiang Li

313
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Help

314
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Madam

315
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Madam

316
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You

317
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Look at Brother Tang

318
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Be a guardian wolf

319
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What are you doing

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Father, you are also

321
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Why do you have to bring him back

322
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You girl will be confused

323
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Even if you brother Tang

324
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Be a guardian wolf

325
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Then they can't afford

326
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Dad and our Ye family

327
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Besides

328
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Your cousin

329
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He said he would follow

330
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I can still stop him from following

331
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I didn't recognize him

332
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
He is my cousin

333
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No

334
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Let's do it first

335
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Let's watch here

336
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
There are many things at home

337
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The shop is not peaceful

338
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The old lady is doing business

339
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It hurts

340
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
If she knows that Ah Li is coming

341
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
She can't help it

342
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Let's talk about business first

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Old madam

344
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
There is a lot to talk to her

345
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So as not to make the old man's house quiet

346
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But just let him go

347
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's not okay

348
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Our house

349
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
We have to have a person at the top

350
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Tomorrow

351
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Take care of Jiang Li well

352
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Otherwise, our house

353
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It seems like there is no Li Shu

354
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Let Jiang Jia see the joke

355
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Who goes

356
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why do you look at me

357
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I just finished with him

358
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I can't go to anyone

359
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Don't look at me

360
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm going to the shop tomorrow

361
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I didn't have that time

362
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What are you looking at me for

363
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Jiang Li has always been my substitute

364
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You don't show up

365
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It seems like our Ye family

366
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Don't bring him

367
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Or

368
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Then follow our old rules

369
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Catch the bar

370
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Three groups

371
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Only one friend

372
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Who goes first

373
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't say

374
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Come first

375
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The smallest family

376
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't say first

377
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Come one

378
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Come one

379
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You worked hard

380
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Rest tomorrow

381
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Prepare the horse carriage

382
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes

383
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Remember to put the kitchen back

384
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Put the light on the car

385
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes

386
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And the hot water

387
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
OK

388
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The clothes

389
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The rouge

390
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Tong

391
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Tong

392
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Tong

393
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Tong

394
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Sister, you are awake

395
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Who is talking outside in the morning

396
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Sister, it's Jia'er's wife

397
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Jia'er's wife woke up early

398
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Asked us to go out to play

399
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Go out to play

400
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So early

401
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Sister

402
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The thing about the water yesterday

403
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You didn't rest well

404
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
How about I go to the drama now

405
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Let's sleep more

406
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
They are well arranged

407
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
We can't go

408
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,320
It's fun anyway.

409
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,880
Let's go and teach her something.

410
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,640
You haven't started yet?

411
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,940
How long do you really need to teach her?

412
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,880
Are you waiting for this game over night?

413
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,100
Just a few players. Hurry up.

414
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,440
表姐.

415
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,980
I know some oozing

416
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,920
Today

417
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,120
go to今日は

418
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,160
Baiograf Mountain first

419
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:32,460
ThenMo

420
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:32,860
The special food of the latter

421
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,900
A visit by a group in the afternoon

422
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:43,320
Miaoyuan

423
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,820
Winter here

424
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,660
I...

425
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,860
Cousin,

426
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,060
I know you're being dragged by your family.

427
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,420
You're afraid of being bullied and want to play with me.

428
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,620
Actually,

429
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,460
I've been working hard on my journey.

430
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,780
I don't have any fun.

431
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,820
What do you mean?

432
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,820
It's not good enough to arrange it first.

433
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,180
You can change it if you like it.

434
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,620
How about this?

435
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,220
I'll tell Uncle and Aunt.

436
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,620
Lu Yang's mountain water is famous and delicious.

437
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,700
Cousin has shown me a change.

438
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,420
You don't have to work too hard.

439
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,940
We don't have to waste time.

440
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,820
But since Cousin is so rude,

441
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,820
I'll just tell you the truth.

442
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,060
You can't say that.

443
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,660
I can't make it.

444
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,060
I'll arrange it.

445
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,900
I'll make it.

446
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,180
I'll make it.

447
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,980
You should have said that.

448
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,740
I've got a bunch of trouble to deal with.

449
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,340
The carriage is ready.

450
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:36,940
It's sunny.

451
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,020
I'll go out and have a look.

452
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,060
I'll come back when it's dark.

453
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,260
Cousin.

454
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,340
I want to go to the shop.

455
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,500
I don't have many clothes when I come out.

456
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,340
I want to be a new clothes.

457
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,900
You don't know the sky is still bright.

458
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,980
You don't know the shop is still open.

459
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,140
Let's go after an hour.

460
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,860
Let's go.

461
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,820
Okay.

462
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,860
Cousin.

463
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,220
I can't give you the money.

464
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,140
Cousin.

465
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,540
All the money in the cabinet are going to be in the account.

466
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,700
If you want to marry her,

467
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,980
you must have the rules of the owner's carriage.

468
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,900
It's the rules.

469
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,620
There's no rules until the last time.

470
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,060
There's a rule this time.

471
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,460
You're making rules for me.

472
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,620
Uncle San.

473
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,380
Uncle San.

474
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,220
Cousin.

475
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,420
It's impossible.

476
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,660
Cousin.

477
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,900
It's impossible.

478
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,780
Cousin.

479
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,180
What's wrong with her?

480
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,780
I guess she did some business again.

481
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,060
She got the money from Huohuo.

482
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,220
She borrowed money from her.

483
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,060
Wait for me here.

484
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,900
I'll handle it. Come back.

485
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,500
I'm so unlucky.

486
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,260
Uncle San.

487
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,420
You're back.

488
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,020
Why are you here?

489
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,980
Miss Xia, you're finally here.

490
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,900
Qi'er.

491
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,420
You're here just in time.

492
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,980
Give me some money.

493
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,460
Uncle San has more than the buyer.

494
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,420
He has less than the buyer.

495
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,900
He's the last one.

496
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,620
How much do you want?

497
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,460
Just a few thousand or two.

498
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,420
What buyer?

499
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,860
You don't know.

500
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,020
Just give me money.

501
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,460
I'll give you more when you get the money.

502
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,180
Uncle San.

503
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,220
I don't want to be a bunch of rascals.

504
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,980
You're so capable.

505
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,540
You little girl.

506
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,180
Just give me some money.

507
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,060
I don't know you.

508
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,420
Don't talk nonsense. Just give me money.

509
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,500
No.

510
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:02,940
Uncle San.

511
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,660
It's hard to have a loan.

512
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,460
You can borrow the money from me.

513
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,340
Otherwise, you can find my father.

514
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,980
You're so capable.

515
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,700
You can take your father's money.

516
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,740
Don't blame Uncle San.

517
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,740
He's not welcome today.

518
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,820
If you don't give me money,

519
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,020
I won't leave.

520
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,620
Right.

521
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,660
I won't leave.

522
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,380
Mr. San.

523
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,140
What's wrong?

524
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,340
You want to hit me?

525
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,660
Hit me?

526
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,300
No.

527
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:34,980
Get out.

528
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,900
I'm your uncle.

529
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,220
Do you think I can't let you eat

530
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,820
your mother's knife?

531
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,780
Uncle San.

532
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,740
I'm in charge of the accounts of Li Zhengtang.

533
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,140
Don't blame him.

534
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,100
Uncle San.

535
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,140
Who are you calling uncle?

536
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,220
Uncle San.

537
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,780
I'm Jiang Li.

538
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,580
My mother.

539
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,900
I'm Zhenzhen.

540
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,020
You never left home.

541
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,620
You must learn to protect yourself.

542
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,460
I'll always be your hero.

543
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,860
You'll protect me.

544
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,260
Zhenzhen.

545
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,180
You must be happy.

546
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,740
I'm happy.

547
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,460
Mother.

548
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,020
Please let me go to the Jiang family.

549
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,300
Bring Zhenzhen and Li back.

550
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,500
Sister is afraid of one person the most.

551
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,660
I can't let her leave alone.

552
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,580
Mother.

553
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,260
She married into the Jiang family.

554
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,220
She was born into the Jiang family.

555
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,660
Death is the ghost of the Jiang family.

556
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,700
Mother.

557
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,780
I'm sorry.

558
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,700
I'm sorry.

559
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,660
I'm sorry.

560
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,660
I'm sorry.

561
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,780
I'm sorry.

562
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,700
I'm sorry.

563
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,740
I'm sorry.

564
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,340
Dad.

565
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,940
Lv.

566
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,940
Yes.

567
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,940
When did you come to Lu Yang?

568
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,940
A few days ago, I came with Er Jiu.

569
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
I had time to come to the shop to see.

570
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,940
Did you have a good time these years?

571
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,940
It's a long story.

572
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,940
Third uncle, why don't we go home and have a talk?

573
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,940
Forget it.

574
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,940
Forget it.

575
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
Today,

576
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,940
I don't want this money

577
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,940
and this money.

578
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,940
Second uncle, let's go.

579
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
We're leaving.

580
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,940
Let's go.

581
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,940
Little sister, don't you want to take some clothes?

582
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,940
Come and have a look.

583
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,940
Do you have a favorite?

584
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,940
Second madam, this is our shop.

585
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,940
The new material is very good.

586
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,940
The color is also the most fashionable.

587
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,940
Manager Qian.

588
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,940
Manager Qian, I demand a refund.

589
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,940
Uncle Zhao, what did you say? Reunite?

590
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940
We can't continue this matter.

591
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,940
Since your father and their family are not here,

592
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940
I'll talk to you first.

593
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,940
Little sister, I have something to discuss with uncle Zhao.

594
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,940
Which department do you think

595
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,940
should be wrapped up by the manager?

596
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,940
Cousin, you go first.

597
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
This way, please.

598
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,940
Okay.

599
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,940
Sister, do you have a new job?

600
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,940
I always feel that the Ye family has encountered a problem.

601
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,940
And this problem is not small.

602
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,940
Ye Mingyu, this bastard.

603
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,940
He has been out for several years.

604
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,940
What's his name?

605
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,940
He's a bandit.

606
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,940
Tell me, where have you been?

607
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,940
I don't know.

608
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,940
You...

609
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,940
Ye Third...

610
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,940
Li is back.

611
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,940
Second uncle.

612
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
Li,

613
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,940
Li, why are you back alone?

614
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,940
Didn't Jiaer accompany you?

615
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,940
Jiaer arranged it very well.

616
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,940
Li is very happy today.

617
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,940
She went to the shop to deal with some things.

618
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,940
I came back alone.

619
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,940
That's good.

620
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,940
Second uncle.

621
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,940
Did something wrong with the business in this house?

622
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,940
This...

623
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,940
Second uncle.

624
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,940
Madam.

625
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
Tong Fuyin sent someone here.

626
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,940
Tong Fuyin?

627
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,940
Yes.

628
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,940
Why did she send someone here?

629
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,940
I don't know either.

630
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,940
Zhu Xianwei, I don't know what happened this time.

631
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,940
Boss Ye,

632
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,940
please go with me.

633
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,940
Go?

634
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,940
Where are you going?

635
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,940
What did she do?

636
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,940
Why did you ask her to come?

637
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
What did she do?

638
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,940
Madam, you are so naughty.

639
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
I am a servant.

640
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,940
Please tell Boss Ye and Tong Fuyin about these problems.

641
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,940
You...

642
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,940
Our business is very quiet.

643
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,940
I am not afraid of the shadow.

644
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,940
I will go with them.

645
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,940
Zhu Xianwei, can you wait for a moment?

646
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,940
I will tell my family.

647
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,940
I was going to take you to see your grandmother.

648
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,940
I didn't think that something like this would happen.

649
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,940
You still have to wait for a while.

650
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,940
Second uncle, I will go to work on you.

651
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,940
Madam, I am not here for a few days.

652
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,940
I have worked hard to take care of the family.

653
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,940
If anything happens to Li Zhengtang,

654
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,940
I will leave it to our family.

655
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,940
This is a good opportunity.

656
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,940
I hope she can be more independent.

657
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,940
Don't tell her about it.

658
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,940
I will go to see Tong Fuyin.

659
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,940
Don't worry.

660
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,940
Zhu Xianwei, when can Second uncle come back?

661
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,940
I have to ask Tong Fuyin about this.

662
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,940
Boss Ye, you can leave after you finish your work.

663
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,940
After the seven days of the Chulan,

664
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,940
you will go to Luyang.

665
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,940
Get ready.

666
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,940
Feed me.

667
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
No.

668
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,940
Throw it away.

669
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,940
Throw it away.

670
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,940
I am free now. I will come to the Xihuan House.

671
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,940
I will give you some time.

672
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,940
Zhu Xuan,

673
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,940
why do you still keep the grass?

674
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,940
It is not good to pay the money.

675
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,940
Shut up.

676
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,940
Master, Tong Zhiyang has already done it.

677
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,940
It's too early.

678
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,940
He sent someone to arrest him in front of Ye's house.

679
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,940
He is still not ready.

680
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,940
Now Ye's house is not enough to hide.

681
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,940
I think Luyang knows it.

682
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
As for Li's house,

683
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,940
he is not ready to laugh.

684
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,940
I heard that Second Madam Jiang was also there.

685
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,940
But Second Madam Jiang did not do anything.

686
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,940
I really have to be sent to the Li's house this time.

687
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,940
You are so jealous.

688
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,940
Why do you still dare to laugh at him?

689
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,940
I dare not to laugh at him.

690
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,940
But the matter of the old and broken,

691
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,940
once it is out, Li Zhenggang will not be kidnapped.

692
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
Ye Mingxuan is not there.

693
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,940
There are only a few women left in Ye's house.

694
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,940
Li's house is already out of control.

695
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
Zhu Xuan,

696
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,940
should we go to the bureau?

697
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,940
Don't treat people as fools.

698
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,940
This show is not over yet.

699
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,940
Don't make a fuss too early.

700
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,940
Keep watching Ye's house.

701
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,940
Yes.

702
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,940
Tong,

703
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,940
help me to get some tea.

704
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,940
Sister,

705
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,940
it's so late now.

706
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,940
You drank too much tea and got hurt.

707
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,940
You woke up so early this morning.

708
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,940
Cousin,

709
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,940
you should go back to the yard and rest.

710
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,940
Don't stay here with us.

711
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,940
If we can't get any news tonight,

712
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,940
I will die too.

713
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,940
I'm afraid that

714
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,940
waiting till the end

715
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,940
is the worst outcome.

716
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,940
Madam.

717
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,940
What do you say?

718
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,940
I didn't even see Tong Fuyin's face.

719
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,940
I didn't even see her face.

720
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,940
I didn't even see her face.

721
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,940
I didn't even see her face.

722
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,940
I didn't even see her face.

723
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
Who has the guts?

724
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,940
There are three more people to kill.

725
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,940
There are three more people to kill.

726
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,940
We are caught by Ye's family.

727
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,940
We don't even have any instructions.

728
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,940
I...

729
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
Madam, what are you doing?

730
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,940
I'll kill you at the entrance of the mansion.

731
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,940
Don't push me.

732
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,940
Don't push me.

733
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,940
I don't dare to do this.

734
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,940
Don't push me.

735
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
Don't worry.

736
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,940
Uncle is still safe now.

737
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,940
Today,

738
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,940
there was such a big battle.

739
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,940
He was in the mansion and took people.

740
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,940
After taking him away,

741
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,940
he didn't have a meeting with the court.

742
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,940
He didn't even have the official documents to report to the world.

743
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,940
I guess

744
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,940
Tong Zhiyang and the others

745
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,940
wanted to take the price.

746
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,940
Take the price?

747
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,940
But he didn't take our money.

748
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,940
It's the same business as this.

749
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,940
The two sides are on the same side.

750
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,940
There is a process of

751
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,940
fighting and fighting.

752
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,940
At this time,

753
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,940
they took the price with the people as goods.

754
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,940
But they didn't want to take the price.

755
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,940
They were waiting

756
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,940
to let Ye's family

757
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,940
take all the money.

758
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,940
How dare he!

759
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,940
Mother,

760
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,940
let's hear the general's story first.

761
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,940
What Erzhong said is not reasonable.

762
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
He, Tong Zhiyang,

763
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,940
is a good man.

764
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,940
But Ye's family is not a small family in Luyang.

765
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,940
First, he didn't take the money.

766
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,940
Second, he didn't have the official documents.

767
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
He took the money

768
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,940
of Ye's family like this.

769
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,940
Isn't Tong Zhiyang afraid

770
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,940
of being taken to the capital?

771
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,940
Sister,

772
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,940
what you mean is

773
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
I'm afraid

774
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,940
he is just a mute who walks in the middle.

775
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,940
There are other people behind him.

776
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,940
Luyang and Fu Yin have been made mute.

777
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,940
Oh, my god.

778
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
Our Ye's family is a white-and-white businessman.

779
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,940
We are like a huge figure.

780
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,940
In business,

781
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,940
we have never offended anyone else.

782
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,940
Other places

783
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,940
may not be the same.

784
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,940
What you mean is...

785
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,940
Shi Buxiangman is in the capital.

786
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,940
Ye's family has refused

787
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,940
to let others down.

788
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,940
Let them down?

789
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,940
Yes.

790
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,940
Li Zhongnan, a son of Li Lian,

791
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,940
and Ye's family

792
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,940
are the same-sexed twins.

793
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,940
He didn't want to

794
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,940
make Ye's family

795
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,940
do it for his own sake.

796
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,940
After Ye's family was broken,

797
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,940
he decided to do it.

798
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,940
That's not fair.

799
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,940
It's just a small matter.

800
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,940
You mean...

801
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
It's just a small matter.

802
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,940
So you mean

803
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,940
they want to use Ye's family

804
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
to threaten my brother?

805
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,940
That's just my guess.

806
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,940
But

807
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,940
before the person behind

808
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
shows his true intention,

809
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,940
it won't happen.

810
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,940
Then...

811
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,940
Isn't it dangerous?

812
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Ye's brother was just

813
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,940
made mute by His Majesty in the capital.

814
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Plus the marriage between our family.

815
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,940
Other people can't move him easily.

816
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,940
But we

817
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,940
don't want to mess with the town.

818
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,940
Maybe they just want us

819
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,940
to be in the wrong.

820
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,940
I'm relieved

821
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,940
by hearing you say that.

822
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,940
Then we'll wait

823
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,940
for Tong Zhiyang to get out of the prison.

824
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,940
Uncle.

825
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,940
What happened to the ancient box?

826
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,940
I'm thinking about it.

827
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,940
I'm afraid it's just a matter

828
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,940
that makes people feel guilty.

829
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,940
The ancient box

830
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,940
was made by our Ye's family.

831
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,940
What you see

832
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
is all the samples

833
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,940
that the family has produced

834
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
for the past three months.

835
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,940
I've been checking it.

836
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,940
There's no problem.

837
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,940
I don't know where it's from.

838
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
It's said that the ancient box

839
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,940
is dead.

840
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,940
It's so dirty

841
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,940
that it's in the blood.

842
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,940
Lu Yang's cloth and clothes

843
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,940
and clothes are all worn out.

844
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,940
They're all coming to get them.

845
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,940
Now I'm thinking about it.

846
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,940
It's just a matter of

847
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,940
making a living.

848
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,940
Have you investigated it?

849
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,940
The thing that's worn out is

850
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,940
the real one.

851
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,940
It's a piece of cake

852
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,940
that's been torn apart.

853
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,940
After the rumor was spread,

854
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,940
my father sent a lot of people

855
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,940
to investigate it.

856
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,940
The dead didn't find it.

857
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,940
But

858
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,940
there's really a group of

859
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,940
ancient boxes that have problems.

860
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,940
The people who have been in contact with this group

861
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,940
have all been red-skinned.

862
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,940
Now

863
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,940
we don't know

864
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,940
if this rumor is true or not.

865
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,940
Then tomorrow morning

866
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,940
we'll go and see

867
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,940
if there's anything wrong with this batch.

868
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,940
Cousin.

869
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,940
If you didn't hold back today,

870
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,940
the Ye family would be in big trouble.

871
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I've been busy with business

872
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,940
but I don't know how to observe these troubles.

873
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,940
It's all thanks to you

874
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,940
that you've supported my mother.

875
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,940
I'm the daughter of the Ye family.

876
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,940
I should do all these.

877
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,940
I'm so polite with you.

878
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,940
It's so refreshing.

879
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,940
But

880
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,940
I'm still very worried.

881
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,940
What are you worried about?

882
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,940
I'm afraid this is just the beginning.

883
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,940
If this time

884
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,940
no one can be like the one behind it,

885
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,940
the Ye family will not be

886
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,940
the one behind it.

887
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,940
Why should they be like this?

888
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,940
Didn't you say that they would be like this?

889
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,940
Is it because of the hard work

890
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,940
and the hard work

891
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,940
that you've done

892
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,940
to save the people

893
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
just to save the people

894
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,940
from being killed?

895
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
They won't be

896
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
killed because of your retreat.

897
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,940
They'll be punished

898
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,940
and be killed.

899
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,940
The Ye family is prepared to be in trouble

900
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,940
and the family will be in trouble.

901
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,940
If you're all out of the business

902
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,940
and not just the Ye family,

903
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,940
how many people will be killed?

904
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,940
You're right.

905
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,940
I almost died in Zhenyu Hall that year.

906
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,940
But I've survived.

907
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,940
Since I can still live,

908
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,940
the Ye family will be fine.

909
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,940
Cousin.

910
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,940
Why didn't you see Second Uncle?

911
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
My mother has gone to take care of her grandmothers.

912
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,940
Now everyone in the family

913
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,940
is hiding their grandmothers.

914
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,940
I don't know how long

915
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,940
they can keep them.

916
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,940
Don't worry.

917
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,940
Let's find out the truth

918
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,940
about the ancient incense stick.

919
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,940
Madam, it's bad.

920
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,940
Li Zhetang.

921
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Li Zhetang was killed.

922
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,940
Killed?

923
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,940
Those people started to kill things

924
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940
when they came in.

925
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
Even Li Zhetang's tricks

926
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,940
were killed.

927
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,940
My nose was broken.

928
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,940
How should I smell it?

929
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,940
Madam, please go and have a look.

930
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,940
How many people have come?

931
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,940
At least a few.

932
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,940
Li Zhetang was surrounded.

933
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,940
They said

934
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,940
the ancient incense stick

935
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,940
we sold out before

936
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,940
was still in the trouble.

937
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,940
Cousin, wait at home.

938
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,940
I'll go and have a look.

939
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,940
Let's go together

940
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,940
and think of a way.

941
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,940
Master, the holy thread.

942
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,940
The holy thread is inside.

943
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,940
He still likes to sit in the teahouse

944
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,940
and watch his own dirty tricks.

945
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,940
Then we...

946
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,940
Are you the Duke of Su?

947
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,940
There's a young master Li

948
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,940
in the box.

949
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
Let me invite you in.

950
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,940
He also said

951
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,940
you came to see him

952
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,940
and saw him with a great light.

953
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,940
Why did you send

954
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,940
a scoundrel to investigate?

955
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,940
Who's scoundrel?

956
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,940
I'm a scoundrel.

957
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,940
I'm a scoundrel.

958
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,940
I'm a scoundrel.

959
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,940
I'm a scoundrel.

960
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,940
I'm a scoundrel.

961
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,940
I'm a scoundrel.

962
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,940
Who's scoundrel?

963
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,940
Lan Lu.

964
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,940
This way.

965
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,940
Master Li,

966
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,940
I didn't expect

967
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,940
I could meet you in Lu Yang.

968
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,940
I'm really lucky.

969
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,940
Okay.

970
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,940
I didn't expect

971
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,940
I could meet you in Lu Yang.

972
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,940
Good tea.

973
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,940
It's good for your mood.

974
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,940
Thank you, Master Li.

975
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,940
So you invited me

976
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,940
to see the witness.

977
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,940
You're overthinking.

978
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,940
We just drink tea.

979
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,940
Cheng Cheng.

980
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,940
Cheng Cheng.

981
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,940
I know him.

982
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,940
He's the one who's been talking about him.

983
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,940
Cheng Gui.

984
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,940
Lady, you're here.

985
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,940
Thank you.

986
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,940
Go inside and get dressed.

987
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,940
But so many people.

988
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,940
It's okay.

989
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,940
I'll take care of it.

990
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,940
Let's go, Cheng Gui.

991
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,940
Don't go.

992
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,940
Don't go.

993
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,940
Don't go.

994
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,940
I'm the master of Li Zheng Tang.

995
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,940
Ye Jia Er.

996
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,940
If you have anything to say,

997
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,940
we can sit down and talk.

998
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,940
Ye Jia will give you an answer.

999
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,940
You're so stupid.

1000
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,940
You're so stupid.

1001
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,940
You're so stupid.

1002
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,940
You're so stupid.

1003
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,940
You're a national servant.

1004
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,940
Exactly.

1005
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,940
You're so mean.

1006
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,940
You even want to take the money

1007
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,940
of our people in Lu Yang.

1008
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,940
You're making money with black money.

1009
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,940
You're taking the life of our people.

1010
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,940
You're so stupid.

1011
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,940
You're so stupid.

1012
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,940
You're so stupid.

1013
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,940
You're so stupid.

1014
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,940
You're so stupid.

1015
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,940
You're so stupid.

1016
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,940
You're so stupid.

1017
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,940
You're so stupid.

1018
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,940
You're so stupid.

1019
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,940
I don't know

1020
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,940
where the saying of

1021
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,940
the people who will die in the Gu Xiang Duan comes from.

1022
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,940
But our Ye Jia

1023
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,940
has been doing business

1024
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,940
in Lu Yang City for so many years.

1025
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,940
It's all because of the mutual gambling.

1026
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,940
The most powerful one in the world.

1027
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,940
We can't afford it.

1028
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,940
Please leave a message.

1029
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,940
Let us investigate it.

1030
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,940
Liar.

1031
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,940
Ye Jia is a liar.

1032
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,940
He killed a long life.

1033
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,940
He killed a long life.

1034
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,940
He killed a long life.

1035
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,940
He killed a long life.

1036
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,940
He killed a long life.

1037
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,940
He killed a long life.

1038
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,940
He killed a long life.

1039
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,940
He killed a long life.

1040
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,940
He killed a long life.

1041
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,940
He killed a long life.

1042
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,940
He's saved the soldiers.

1043
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,940
I'm afraid he won't make it.

1044
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,940
The new army is coming.

1045
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,940
Take him away.

1046
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,940
Why are you arresting me?

1047
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,940
You're not arresting the person who caused trouble.

1048
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,940
What's the point of arresting me?

1049
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,940
We received a report

1050
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,940
saying that Li Zheng Tang

1051
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,940
was killed by the army.

1052
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,940
And he caused a human death.

1053
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,940
Didn't you take care of the matter?

1054
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,940
Follow us.

1055
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,940
Yes.

1056
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,940
Catch him.

1057
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,940
They killed Li Zheng Tang.

1058
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,940
We can't arrest him.

1059
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,940
Catch him.

1060
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,940
Catch him.

1061
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,940
Catch him.

1062
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,940
Catch him.

1063
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,940
Catch him.

1064
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,940
Catch him.

1065
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,940
Catch him.

1066
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,940
Catch him.

1067
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,940
Catch him.

1068
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,940
Catch him.

1069
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,940
May I ask you.

1070
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,940
Who told you

1071
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,940
that Ye Jia's hometown is in trouble?

1072
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,940
Look at you.

1073
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,940
You have a problem

1074
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,940
with Li Zheng Tang's hometown.

1075
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,940
Who doesn't know about it?

1076
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,940
Look at me.

1077
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,940
Look.

1078
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,940
Look.

1079
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,940
Look.

1080
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,940
I'm a real man.

1081
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,940
Look at me.

1082
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,940
I'm a real man.

1083
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,940
Look.

1084
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,940
Look.

1085
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,940
What are you doing?

1086
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,940
What are you doing?

1087
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,940
What are you doing?

1088
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,940
What are you doing?

1089
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,940
What are you doing?

1090
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,940
Catch him.

1091
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,940
Ke'er.

1092
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,940
Look.

1093
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,940
The clothes I'm wearing

1094
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,940
are Li Zheng Tang's clothes.

1095
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,940
It's the new clothes

1096
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,940
that Ye gave me yesterday.

1097
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,940
It's also the cloth from the hometown.

1098
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,940
But I've been wearing it all day.

1099
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,940
There's no such thing as you.

1100
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,940
You don't believe me?

1101
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,940
Fine.

1102
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,940
If you don't believe me,

1103
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,940
these ladies

1104
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,940
come and see.

1105
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,940
Let me see.

1106
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,940
Yes.

1107
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,940
It's really the cloth from the hometown.

1108
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,940
If the hometown

1109
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,940
really has a problem,

1110
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,940
isn't it possible

1111
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,940
to wear it on yourself?

1112
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,940
It's impossible.

1113
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,940
You're Ye's son.

1114
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:57,940
You're the one who took Ye's money

1115
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:58,940
and made a film for Ye's family.

1116
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,940
What's the point of your life?

1117
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,940
You're wrong.

1118
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,940
My life

1119
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,940
is even more valuable

1120
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,940
than Li Zheng Tang's.

1121
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,940
You're so cruel.

1122
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,940
Who are you?

1123
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:10,940
Who are you?

1124
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,940
I'm the prime minister of the court.

1125
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,940
The daughter of the crown prince.

1126
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,940
The daughter of the crown prince.

1127
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,940
Jiang Li.

1128
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,940
Jiang Li?

1129
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,940
I didn't expect

1130
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,940
to have a wife like Jiang Er

1131
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,940
to help Ye's family.

1132
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,940
She's not afraid

1133
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,940
of being exposed.

1134
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,940
She's not afraid of being exposed?

1135
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,940
Mr. Li,

1136
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,940
the film is still behind.

1137
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:46,940
Mr. Li,

1138
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,940
the film is still behind.

1139
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,940
The film is still behind.

1140
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,940
The film is still behind.

1141
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,940
The film is still behind.

1142
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,940
The film is still behind.

1143
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,940
The film is still behind.

1144
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,940
The film is still behind.

1145
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,940
The film is still behind.

1146
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,940
The film is still behind.

1147
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,940
The film is still behind.

1148
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,940
The film is still behind.

1149
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:58,940
The film is still behind.

1150
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,940
The film is still behind.

1151
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,940
The film is still behind.

1152
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,940
The film is still behind.

1153
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,940
The film is still behind.

1154
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,940
The film is still behind.

1155
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,940
The film is still behind.

1156
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,940
The film is still behind.

1157
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,940
The film is still behind.

1158
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,940
The film is still behind.

1159
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,940
The film is still behind.

1160
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,940
The film is still behind.

1161
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:10,940
The film is still behind.

1162
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,940
The film is still behind.

1163
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,940
The film is still behind.

1164
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:13,940
The film is still behind.

1165
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,940
Two cold words,

1166
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,940
a heartless silence.

1167
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,940
Holding hands,

1168
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,940
can you pass through the snow?

1169
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,940
In the cold wind,

1170
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,940
in the long night,

1171
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,940
the warmth that is left behind

1172
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,940
is embraceable.

1173
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:49,940
The body is still alive,

1174
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,940
not firm.

1175
00:45:53,940 --> 00:46:00,940
Can you bury the traces of yesterday?

1176
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,940
Love is going,

1177
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,940
with life to cherish.

1178
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,940
Fire goes down,

1179
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,940
even if there is a little injury.

1180
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,940
No matter how much I am hurt,

1181
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,940
I believe in you.

1182
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:30,940
I'd rather be trapped in the cold of the world.

1183
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,940
Fire goes down,

1184
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,940
hold on to all the courage.

1185
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,940
Love goes down,

1186
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,940
even if there is a little injury.

1187
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,940
The process of passing through life,

1188
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,940
is not for you.

1189
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,940
After the cup,

1190
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,940
I won't be far away.

1191
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,940
After the cup,

1192
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:08,940
I won't be far away.

1193
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,940
After the cup,

1194
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,940
I won't be far away.

1195
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,940
After the cup,

1196
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,940
I won't be far away.

1197
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,940
After the cup,

1198
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,940
I won't be far away.

1199
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,940
After the cup,

1200
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,940
I won't be far away.

1201
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,940
After the cup,

1202
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,940
I won't be far away.

1203
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,940
After the cup,
