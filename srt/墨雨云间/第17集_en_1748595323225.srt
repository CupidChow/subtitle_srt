1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't admit it

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain of hiding

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
When the spring color is still the same

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Story of the Phoenix

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What are you doing?

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What do you want?

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm the escort of Ye Laosan

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Not Ye Jia Ye Laosan

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Uncle San, no one will escort you

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You...let her go, okay?

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I won't let her go

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She's my daughter

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't take her away

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I won't leave her here alone

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
She's not your daughter

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You don't believe it?

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You call her a doctor and see if she's okay?

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I won't leave her

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I won't leave her

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Go back, let her go

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Go back, go back

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't hit me

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I didn't protect you

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I didn't protect you

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Zhen Zhen, I miss you so much

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Come and visit me, okay?

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I miss you every day and night

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm begging you, please

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Please, Zhen Zhen

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't worry

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I...that's my uncle

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He's home

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Good job

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Today is really a happy day

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You...that big fat man

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Fatty

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Fatty

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're drunk

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Who said I'm drunk?

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm drunk

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm not drunk

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm not drunk

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm not drunk

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm not drunk

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm not drunk

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're drunk like a man

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,720
Golden

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Val-i

63
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,120
Fine

64
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,600
But why do I fall in love with you

65
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,500
I will go forward

66
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
My soul runs sweet away

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,960
I fight for love

68
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,760
When romance...

69
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,800
I don't know if I am good or not

70
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,880
I know that you are pretty

71
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,720
Wherever you go

72
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,800
If people love our love

73
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,060
There will always be bound by us

74
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,960
There will always be爸爸 and my son

75
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
I'm not drunk.

76
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
I'm not drunk.

77
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Xiao Hong, you're not a man.

78
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
You're not drunk!

79
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,960
You've never been honest in your life, right?

80
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,960
You've never been honest in your life, right?

81
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
What about you?

82
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,960
A'Li, you've been drinking so much.

83
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
You're not honest in your life, right?

84
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Thank you, Duke Su.

85
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Thank you, Duke Su.

86
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Thank you, Duke Su.

87
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Thank you, Duke Su.

88
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
Thank you, Duke Su.

89
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Stand still.

90
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,960
The flower is blooming.

91
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,960
The wind blows, the sky is clear.

92
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,960
The night is beautiful.

93
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
I'll take you home.

94
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Home?

95
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,960
I don't have a home.

96
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
I suggest you leave.

97
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,960
Otherwise, you'll be late to ruin the people's lives.

98
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,960
I don't have a home.

99
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,960
I'll take you home.

100
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,960
The night is beautiful.

101
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Where did A'Li go?

102
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
It's so late.

103
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
You don't know?

104
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,960
After I went to the Ye San House,

105
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
I came back by myself.

106
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
I didn't say where to go.

107
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
I'm so worried.

108
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
I've been working all night.

109
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
I'm so worried.

110
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Why are you in a hurry?

111
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Are you really her maid?

112
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
What's the use of being in a hurry?

113
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
It's really useful.

114
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Empress.

115
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Let's go.

116
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
How is he drunk?

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,960
Why did you let him drink?

118
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
What right do you use to do this? Who are you?

119
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
It's his benefactor.

120
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,000
But now I love you.

121
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,680
have the whole country

122
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,720
take care of them.

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
For the rest of the world,

124
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,240
better to be safe

125
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,520
and stay in good Connor

126
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,760
against the rule.

127
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,120
You know

128
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,920
what?

129
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,400
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,160
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,760
Slow down.

132
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,440
You're not going toIndy

133
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,520
And here later,

134
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,200
he will be voyeur and scapegoat in the capital,

135
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,440
who will have to go to the hunting center to buy wrapping grief.

136
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,400
Take care.

137
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,560
You can go.

138
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Have you seen

139
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,880
the city has just been disbanded?

140
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,960
But

141
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
How is it going over there?

142
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Everything is fine.

143
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Is the master doing well over there?

144
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
It's been delayed for a month.

145
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Ulan is just worried about you.

146
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Ulan is just worried about you.

147
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
You came from the Dai State to the south.

148
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
You caused a lot of trouble.

149
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
I brought you here.

150
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Now, you can take the risk.

151
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
If you didn't save the master,

152
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Ulan is now a ghost.

153
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
This time, Lu Yang,

154
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
besides dealing with the location,

155
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
there's one more thing I want to ask you.

156
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Master, please say it.

157
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
The location.

158
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Besides the traitor,

159
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
you need to deal with him.

160
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Who is it?

161
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
It's Dai Guo Ran.

162
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Two spinua is there,

163
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
there's something I want to ask.

164
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
What's wrong with her?

165
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
I second you about the location.

166
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
She is passport security.

167
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,960
I want the name first.

168
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
The shoes, her first name means

169
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,240
theffee

170
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
How many trees is in your hands?

171
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,560
It's a good thing.

172
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,760
It's a good thing.

173
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,400
I'm very happy.

174
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,800
What are you talking about?

175
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,840
Baigu Yu,

176
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,520
you can hear it.

177
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,280
Have some tea.

178
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,960
Who's there?

179
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,360
Since Duke Su is here,

180
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,080
why don't you come in and sit down?

181
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,920
It's been a long time.

182
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,280
Xiao Heng.

183
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,920
It's him.

184
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,560
Since you're here,

185
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,960
don't leave tonight.

186
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,160
Then let's see if you have the ability

187
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,920
to keep me here.

188
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,320
Watch out!

189
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,760
What's going on?

190
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,480
Piss.

191
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,000
Go away!

192
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,920
Protect me!

193
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,320
Ok.

194
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,440
using your power

195
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,640
is perfect for you.

196
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
I'll help you.

197
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Why?

198
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Wulan, you're like your brother.

199
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
You're a useless thing.

200
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
My brother...

201
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
You betrayed the organization.

202
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
You betrayed me.

203
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
How can I keep him?

204
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Go to the underground to find him.

205
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
I'll help you.

206
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Why?

207
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Wulan,

208
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
you're like your brother.

209
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
You're a useless thing.

210
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
My brother...

211
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
Go to find him.

212
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
You're really not a useless thing.

213
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
I'm sure you know what happened tonight.

214
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
You don't deserve to be followed by Prince Cheng.

215
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
You don't deserve to be followed by Prince Cheng.

216
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
You're here to see me?

217
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
You haven't been drinking for so long.

218
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
You don't deserve to be followed by me?

219
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
I don't.

220
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
You don't deserve to be followed by me?

221
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Five rounds?

222
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
You're really Prince Cheng's subordinate.

223
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
You're quite risky.

224
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
You can win.

225
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,240
We can't go home with him today, right?

226
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
Five demons?

227
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
We can go see you.

228
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
You're a prisoner.

229
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Go.

230
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,040
You Luzhi are the only one who has the power to resistonge.

231
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,620
It would be really tough if they !"

232
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,380
You pay back!

233
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,980
God..

234
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,120
Xiao indoor hall!

235
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,880
Little Xiang Mu do you have the ability?

236
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,300
Ever since about this day,

237
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,360
I've not had any thoughts.

238
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,400
And now I feel like I'm stage-work in Re爸爸's House.

239
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Open your mouth sharper than ever

240
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,640
a man is always ceaseless.

241
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,200
Your Tamils are so beautiful.

242
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,800
You are the first one I see off.

243
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,500
Aren't you ungrateful?

244
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,600
I should be the first one.

245
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,260
Don't mention yoururity

246
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,660
Be sure to give orders.

247
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,040
Please speak.

248
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,380
Master, he ran away.

249
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,320
Bring all his work back to Square comprarse to liar.

250
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,180
Yes.

251
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,780
Father, the Black FORASE reported

252
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,980
that Lai Biao took out the rock head.

253
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,980
I'm so happy.

254
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,980
You're really a daughter of the Jiang family.

255
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,980
You have a lot of tricks.

256
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,980
Since you can even open your mouth with a sharp tongue,

257
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,980
then let them go happily.

258
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
I hope you will return.

259
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,980
Be careful.

260
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Do you still want to vomit?

261
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,980
I'm dizzy after sitting up.

262
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,980
I'll go to make you a pot of濃 tea.

263
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,980
Don't drink.

264
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,980
I still have a lot to do today.

265
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,980
I'm not in a hurry to drink your濃 tea.

266
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,980
Li!

267
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,980
Li, are you feeling better?

268
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,980
Let me see.

269
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,980
You're much better.

270
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,980
Don't be so emotional.

271
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,980
You were so drunk yesterday.

272
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,980
You should be feeling better now.

273
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,980
I found someone to make you a warm red bean porridge

274
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,980
and a refreshing purple sweet potato drink.

275
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,980
Thank you, cousin.

276
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
Don't be sad.

277
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,980
You're so sweet.

278
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,980
Yesterday...

279
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,980
What did you and Uncle San go for?

280
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,980
I went to your Lu Yang's black market.

281
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:40,800
I checked the buyer's address of the

282
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
black market.

283
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
What is this?

284
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
I'm not drunk.

285
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
I'm not drunk.

286
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
What is this?

287
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
What is this?

288
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
It's a...

289
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
It's a stranger.

290
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
A stranger?

291
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Why did he tell me that

292
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
it's your benefactor?

293
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
He likes to talk nonsense.

294
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,800
Don't put it on your heart.

295
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
It's a stranger.

296
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Why do I feel so familiar?

297
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Let me clean up.

298
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
I want to check the source of the濃 tea.

299
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Wait a minute.

300
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
I'll go with you, okay?

301
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Li, wherever you go, bring me.

302
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Madam,

303
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
I'm going to take you to the black market.

304
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
It's bad.

305
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Madam is going to the black market again.

306
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Cousin,

307
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
you still want to stay at the night market

308
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
to stay in the big market?

309
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
You haven't sobered up.

310
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
How did you win yesterday?

311
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,800
I heard that the price of the milk is high.

312
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
No one can drink it.

313
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Don't bother.

314
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Anyway, he lost in the end.

315
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Look at you.

316
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
You really treat your mother like a child.

317
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Let's be honest.

318
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Did the milk bottle tell you

319
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
who the buyer is?

320
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
The only buyer in Lu Yang

321
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
is the one who bought the milk.

322
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Someone is here.

323
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Look at the patient.

324
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Stop shouting.

325
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
The patient who came here this morning

326
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
was knocked down one by one.

327
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
He didn't come here to open the door.

328
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
I guess he went out.

329
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Where did he go?

330
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Did he say when he would come back?

331
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Who knows?

332
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
He didn't even tell us.

333
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
He was here yesterday.

334
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Was it too loud when he broke into the water station?

335
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Someone sent him a message.

336
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Let's find another bottle.

337
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
No.

338
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Boss,

339
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
take the stool.

340
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
Take it.

341
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Search carefully.

342
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Be careful.

343
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Let's go.

344
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Where are you going?

345
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
I'm working early in the morning.

346
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Why don't you treat me to breakfast?

347
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Please eat.

348
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
I'll treat you.

349
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Boss, two bags of buns.

350
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Here they are.

351
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
This is a closed room.

352
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Why are they here?

353
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Oh, no.

354
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Shun is still inside.

355
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
You...

356
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Jiang Erniang,

357
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
you are so clever.

358
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
You brought so many people to the pharmacy

359
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
this morning.

360
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
Was there a big problem?

361
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
I was fine.

362
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
I just heard from the people

363
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
that the big problem is that

364
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
I have to take care of it.

365
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
I have to take care of it.

366
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
You...

367
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
You...

368
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
I just heard from the people that

369
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
the big problem is that

370
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
the drugstore is out of blood.

371
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
I'm a parent.

372
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
I can't even get a car.

373
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
So I came here.

374
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
You two are here.

375
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
But you have heard the news.

376
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Just a bag of buns.

377
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Sanjou, let's go.

378
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
It's closed.

379
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
I can't move.

380
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Madam,

381
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
the drugstore is closed.

382
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
It's a terrible crime.

383
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
It's a life-saving crime.

384
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
It's closed.

385
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Eight people are killed.

386
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Eight people are killed.

387
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
Eight people are killed.

388
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
My god.

389
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
What's going on?

390
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
What's going on?

391
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
We caught a suspect.

392
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Bring him out.

393
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
I really came to buy the medicine.

394
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
I smelled blood in the door.

395
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
I went in to see it.

396
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
I bought the medicine from the back door.

397
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
You treat me like a fool.

398
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Sit down.

399
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Calm down.

400
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Otherwise,

401
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
you can't save Ah Shun.

402
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
You will hurt yourself.

403
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Who is your accomplice?

404
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm so lonely.

405
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
I can't ask him to sell the buns.

406
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
I knocked on the door for a long time.

407
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
No one opened it.

408
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,800
I went in.

409
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Take him back.

410
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Ask the interrogator.

411
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Who is it?

412
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
It's a sunny day.

413
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
In my place,

414
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
such a terrible thing happened.

415
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
I'm a cruel and despicable person.

416
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
I'm so guilty.

417
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
I'm guilty.

418
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
I'm guilty.

419
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
I'm going to report this to the government.

420
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
I'll investigate this case.

421
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
I'll give the medicine to the king.

422
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
I'll give you a justice.

423
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Justice.

424
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Justice.

425
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Justice.

426
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
I'll fight against the evil.

427
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
I'll fight against the evil.

428
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Go.

429
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Go.

430
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
What's going on?

431
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
What's going on?

432
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
What's going on?

433
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Go.

434
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Go.

435
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Go.

436
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Go.

437
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Go.

438
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Go.

439
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Go.

440
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Go.

441
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Go.

442
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Go.

443
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Go.

444
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
Go.

445
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Go.

446
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
Go.

447
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Go.

448
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Go.

449
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Second Miss Jiang.

450
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
The investigation is over.

451
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I'm in a hurry to return to the capital.

452
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
You are...

453
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
The arrival of the Tuoluo is unknown.

454
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
The only clue now is that

455
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
the Fengyao Pavilion is closed again.

456
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Is this how you handle the case?

457
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Second Miss Jiang,

458
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
I'm a official from the natural reserve.

459
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,800
I'm here to investigate the case of the ancient incense stick.

460
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
I've been with the people of the ancient incense stick

461
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
to find out the true origin of the Tuoluo flower.

462
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
As for how it came,

463
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
I have no right to investigate it.

464
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
But now, the ancient incense stick...

465
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Second Miss Jiang.

466
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
I've done my job.

467
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
As for what you said,

468
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
it's a case of the poison.

469
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
I'm here to take care of it.

470
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Second Miss Jiang,

471
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
please don't make me suffer any more.

472
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
I...

473
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Ma Fu, Ji Cheng.

474
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
This...

475
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
This is how you leave?

476
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
This cousin...

477
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Something must have happened.

478
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Maid.

479
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
A Li, how is it?

480
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
The line is broken.

481
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
I'm sorry.

482
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
It's okay.

483
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
You've done a great job.

484
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
If it weren't for you,

485
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
our family would have

486
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
no idea if you could hold on to it now.

487
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Maid.

488
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
You've done everything you can.

489
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Now, just leave it to us.

490
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
It's not a big deal.

491
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
I've got a lot of

492
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
comrades in charge.

493
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Maid.

494
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Is Boss Ye in there?

495
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Mrs. Tong has something to say.

496
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
I've been thinking for a long time.

497
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
In fact, the ancient incense stick

498
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
has a solution.

499
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
What do you mean?

500
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Someone in the top

501
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
appreciates the talent of Ye Shijie.

502
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
He also hopes to be close to the Ye family.

503
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Unfortunately, he is a bit old-fashioned.

504
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
He can't tolerate

505
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
to be bullied by others.

506
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
There are only some tricks up there.

507
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
It's better for you to understand

508
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,800
the meaning of a righteous person.

509
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
You're too much.

510
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
It's too much.

511
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
Maid, you understand, too.

512
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Ye family is a generation of business.

513
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
But Ye Shijie

514
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
is not interested in the city.

515
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Someone loves him personally.

516
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
This is his father.

517
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
He doesn't love him.

518
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
But you Ye family

519
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,800
are too ignorant.

520
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
I don't understand

521
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
what you mean.

522
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Good.

523
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Maid.

524
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,800
I won't hide you from me.

525
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
I don't know

526
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
how you suddenly

527
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,800
got on the line with the second wife.

528
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,800
She moved the natural tree

529
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
out of her own hands.

530
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
No matter how you torture her,

531
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
you're wasting your time.

532
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
After all,

533
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Lu Yangcheng's seal

534
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
is my colleague's.

535
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
We only want to ask for the truth.

536
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Maid, you're so stupid.

537
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
The truth is always in your hands.

538
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Open your hands.

539
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
The truth comes naturally.

540
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
The truth comes naturally.

541
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Hold your hands tight.

542
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,800
The truth will be trampled on by you.

543
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
How much do you want?

544
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Ten thousand?

545
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Ten thousand?

546
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Golden.

547
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Ye family is not a treasure box.

548
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
This number

549
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
Ye family can't afford.

550
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Maid,

551
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,800
think it over.

552
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,800
This is today's price.

553
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
When one day

554
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
you Ye family will be in the trap,

555
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,800
you will be in the price.

556
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
People say that

557
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
it's hard to get rid of the hard-earned.

558
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
As long as there's a chance,

559
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Ye family will be in the same boat.

560
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
The tea is too expensive.

561
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
Ye family can't afford it.

562
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,800
She wants Ye family to be in the same boat

563
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
and want to break Ye cousin's way.

564
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
She can't let him do that.

565
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
But aunt,

566
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
let me think of another way.

567
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
How can the Ye family's burden

568
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
be on you?

569
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Besides,

570
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
no matter how much money

571
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
it is,

572
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
it's all the business of the Ye family.

573
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
But Ye family now...

574
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Li,

575
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Ye family has been in business for so many years.

576
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
The most money is the money.

577
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Because of the money,

578
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
we didn't see much

579
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
when we broke the king.

580
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Other people say that business is a mess.

581
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
In our Ye family,

582
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
there's nothing to say.

583
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
No matter how the family is,

584
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
the most important thing is family.

585
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
You are also our family.

586
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
How can I let you be alone?

587
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
I secretly hid here when I was a kid.

588
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
I learned to be noble and talk to the customers.

589
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
My dad taught me how to calculate the money.

590
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
But I thought that my dad could be safe.

591
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
He was late.

592
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
I will try to return it to him.

593
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Let's go home.

594
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
The fruit of this dress is sweet.

595
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Until my mouth is soft,

596
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,800
my mom will especially marry him with me.

597
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Madam,

598
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
this is all your dowry.

599
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
You can't take it out.

600
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
As long as the world is peaceful and peaceful,

601
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
there's nothing to be reluctant.

602
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Li,

603
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
go find the person in the bank.

604
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Yes.

605
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
Go.

606
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Go.

607
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Madam, look at this.

608
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
It's a mess.

609
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
The door is a good red wood.

610
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
The dress is made of plastic.

611
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
The owner is in a hurry to use the money.

612
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
Look at this wood.

613
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
These are good wood.

614
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
I think this wood is really good.

615
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
This year is really good.

616
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
Uncle,

617
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
look at this.

618
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
You want to sell the Escort?

619
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
There's no business.

620
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
What's the use of keeping an empty shell?

621
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
You want to make money for the Ye family, right?

622
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,800
Uncle and aunt are right.

623
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
For the Ye family,

624
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
family is more important than others.

625
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Ye family is in trouble this time.

626
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
No one is idle.

627
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Even you are so close to the capital.

628
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
I can still stand by.

629
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
I suddenly remembered.

630
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
When we were in the Li town hall together,

631
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
it was so good.

632
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
But then,

633
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
my brother and sister-in-law suddenly died.

634
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
I came out to do it alone.

635
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,800
At that time, I was young and young.

636
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Who was willing to admit defeat?

637
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
In the end,

638
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,800
I couldn't pull this off.

639
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Uncle,

640
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
it's not late to go home now.

641
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,800
I'm so happy to be with you for more than ten years.

642
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
I can't go back with the Taishi.

643
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
You can go back.

644
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
I can't go back.

645
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
You can go back.

646
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
This is the deposit from the bank.

647
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
When the house is sold, there is still a sum of money.

648
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Give it to Er Sao.

649
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
I won't give it to him.

650
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
Give it to him.

651
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
You give it to him yourself.

652
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
And these.

653
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
These.

654
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
These are all the opportunities

655
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
left by the Nantuan North in my years.

656
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
The standard is almost the same.

657
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
But these rare things.

658
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
Can sell good prices.

659
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
When the money is sold,

660
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
you can give it to Ye.

661
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
The tarp is long and the clouds are out.

662
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,800
The song is long and the sand is dark.

663
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
What do you mean?

664
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
Nothing.

665
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,800
I just suddenly thought of a way.

666
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Look.

667
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Look.

668
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Look.

669
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
The tarp is gone.

670
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Your bag.

671
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Please enjoy.

672
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
You asked me to eat.

673
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
This is it.

674
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
You can't choose a place, can you?

675
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Duke Su, don't underestimate this bag.

676
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
This is the most delicious one in Lu Yang.

677
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
The skin is soft and fluffy.

678
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,100
How many thousands?

679
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,200
How about it?

680
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,800
The one with the lowest score is the one with the highest score.

681
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,000
Just one?

682
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,200
Say it.

683
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,400
What's the matter?

684
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
That night...

685
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,600
Thank you.

686
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,900
So,

687
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,300
you still remember

688
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,800
the one with the lowest score?

689
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,800
I just remember

690
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,800
giving you the red-yellow-yellow envelope.

691
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,000
I borrowed the red-yellow-yellow envelope.

692
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,800
You asked me to eat buns.

693
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,800
The outsider, please go to the Palace of State of Su to watch the play.

694
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,500
I don't watch the play.

695
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,400
Come back.

696
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,400
Xiao Hong.

697
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,200
Someone thought I was watching the play on the road.

698
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,500
So they wanted to kill me.

699
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,700
Shes so nervous.

700
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,400
Don't be so deliberate and say it.

701
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,400
Actually,

702
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,100
we saw the attacker so extremely phones brincing.

703
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,400
Ready?

704
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,500
Say it.

705
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,300
What's the play?

706
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,960
From now on,

707
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,900
it's none of your business.

708
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,800
Lady Ye,

709
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,500
What does that mean?

710
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:41,620
I'm just

711
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,620
This is the biggest crime of the Ye family.

712
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,620
Please forgive us.

713
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,620
Please forgive us.

714
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,620
But Madam Ye,

715
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,620
I remember I have already mentioned you.

716
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,620
I have to leave as soon as possible.

717
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,620
Now this price

718
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,620
is hard to buy for the peace of the Ye family.

719
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,620
This is the key to the treasure of the Ye family.

720
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,620
The treasure of the Ye family.

721
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,620
The last thing that will be left to the Ye family.

722
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,620
Everything is in it.

723
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,620
Please help me to make a contribution to the Ye family.

724
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,620
I will do my best.

725
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,620
I will do my best.

726
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,620
I will do my best.

727
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,620
I will do my best.

728
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,620
I will do my best.

729
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,620
I will do my best.

730
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,620
I will do my best.

731
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,620
Understood.

732
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,620
Chuchun.

733
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,620
The instruction desk of the killer has been sealed.

734
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,340
Shall we go up to you?

735
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,340
No need.

736
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,180
These people don't know about Chu Lan's whereabouts.

737
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
What should we do?

738
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,820
Now that Wulan is dead,

739
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,940
Chu Lan has escaped.

740
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,940
All the clues are gone.

741
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,060
Did you rent the house of the tea house?

742
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,860
Yes.

743
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,220
They would change the place every year.

744
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,940
They didn't mean it.

745
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,340
Then you ask the owner.

746
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,700
Who handed in the rent?

747
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,500
Yes.

748
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,140
Lord.

749
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,540
What is this?

750
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,060
The maid in the 토合寺

751
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,340
illustrured the steamed buns at myunt's.

752
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,340
She said she had invited you to come.

753
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,700
Which station has the courtony's observation office been?

754
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,540
Summon her in.

755
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,460
Yes.

756
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,380
Master, is that bed despite the map?

757
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,580
If we have to shoot them for real

758
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,300
the picture won't be released

759
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,680
But that second foods

760
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,720
STS is calledxton

761
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,520
Well...

762
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,180
and the behind cover

763
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,340
Mrs Jang underestimate them

764
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,020
you'll see

765
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,140
Not bad

766
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,380
It's true that Ye family's family is rich.

767
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,380
It's a good deal.

768
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,380
The observation room received a secret report

769
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,880
that Lu Yang's family was attacked by the imperial court.

770
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,380
Is there anything wrong?

771
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,380
I'm Ye family's third brother.

772
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,880
Ye family was attacked by the imperial court.

773
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,880
But Lu Yang's wife, Tong Zhiyang, took her away.

774
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,880
She even took my son to the prison to kill him.

775
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,880
It's a big crime to kill her.

776
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,380
It's true.

777
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,380
You're so bold.

778
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,380
Wait.

779
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,380
Ye family has a batch of supplies to give to His Majesty.

780
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,880
But they were taken away by Lu Yang's wife, Tong Zhiyang.

781
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,380
I heard that the imperial court has a observation room nearby Lu Yang's.

782
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,380
Please send this message to the observation room.

783
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,380
The observation room has a observation room.

784
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,380
Lu Yang was not aware of the news.

785
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,380
Did you make a mistake?

786
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,880
It's natural that the calculation room is not a water flower.

787
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,380
But it was taken by Su Guo.

788
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,380
It's different.

789
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,380
Look.

790
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,380
Look.

791
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,380
These are all the contributions of our Ye family.

792
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,380
Where is the seal?

793
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,380
What is the name of this seal?

794
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,380
Flower-picking?

795
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,380
No.

796
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,380
It's called the seal-picking sign.

797
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,880
It was originally what Tong Zhiyang took away to give to His Majesty.

798
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:49,880
I'm so happy.

799
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,380
I received a secret report.

800
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,880
I came to investigate Lu Yang's secret police.

801
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,880
Tong's secret police is still asking for official's help.

802
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,380
Tong Zhiyang is a deputy.

803
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,380
I'll explain to the observation room.

804
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,380
I'll return the stuff and say it's a misunderstanding.

805
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,380
It's not easy to break this seal.

806
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,380
It's not easy to explain.

807
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,380
But this must be given to the Ye family's family.

808
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:18,380
They say these contributions are from the Ye family to serve the Ye family.

809
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,380
They are not Tong Zhiyang's personal servants.

810
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,380
So if Tong Zhiyang wants to live,

811
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,380
he must come over to beg for Ye family.

812
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,380
Then everything will be fine.

813
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,880
I've received the seal.

814
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,880
I've just received the seal.

815
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
Where is it from?

816
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,880
But after Tong Zhiyang made a mistake,

817
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,880
you said that the observation room was a mess.

818
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,880
Who will be the one to blame?

819
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,880
After that,

820
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,880
I want to eat the meat-picking seal.

821
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,880
I'll give you the seal.

822
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,880
You didn't see it.

823
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,880
Tong Zhiyang's expression was so green.

824
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,380
I'm telling you, I've never been so happy.

825
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,380
Yes.

826
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,380
Although the seal is good,

827
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,380
there are also knives to kill in the seal.

828
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,380
If they want to steal money,

829
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,380
we'll give them the seal.

830
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,380
Now they stole the seal,

831
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,380
how can they not wear it?

832
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,380
So the Ye family is doing business

833
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,380
and they are not good at it.

834
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,380
They are not good at it.

835
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,380
Next, you and Tong Zhiyang

836
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,880
If Tong Zhiyang wants to take the blame

837
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,880
for the observation room,

838
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,880
then we have to help the Ye family

839
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,880
to clear the case of the accident.

840
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,880
But we have to let them go.

841
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,880
But they won't be promoted to the second place.

842
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,880
He doesn't have a chance.

843
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,880
He's afraid that he'll be in trouble

844
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,880
and he won't let him do it again.

845
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,880
That's great.

846
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,880
Isn't it 12 birds in one stone?

847
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,880
Uncle.

848
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,380
This time, you sold your own Escort for the Ye family.

849
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,380
Why don't you go home with this opportunity?

850
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,380
I'm so poor right now.

851
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,380
I can't believe I can see them laughing at me.

852
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,380
Guess what?

853
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,380
I asked Uncle to investigate for me.

854
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,380
What did he say?

855
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,380
He must have said that I can't go to Escort.

856
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,380
I don't have any money with me.

857
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,380
That's not what he said.

858
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,380
He said that

859
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,380
A'Li,

860
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,880
you are not reliable.

861
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,880
But you can't be trusted by the big things.

862
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,880
He asked me to cooperate with you.

863
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,880
He even looked at me secretly.

864
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,880
He said that if the Ye family can't go to Escort,

865
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,880
I'll secretly hide him in the pillow and give him to you.

866
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,880
He also asked me to say something.

867
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,880
He said that the Ye family has no money.

868
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,880
He asked you to go home cleanly.

869
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,880
He really said that?

870
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,880
Brotherhood is like a plot.

871
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,880
He's happy and like a brother.

872
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,380
Brotherhood is like a plot.

873
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,380
He's happy and like a brother.

874
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,380
Go home.

875
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,380
If he really thinks of me,

876
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,380
I'll give them some respect

877
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,380
for Qi Nan.

878
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,380
I'll go home and see them.

879
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,380
Go.

880
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,380
Change it to Erlang's favorite.

881
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,880
Sister,

882
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,880
words are always al我的.

883
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,880
Sister,

884
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:41,380
Mi

885
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,380
I'm just reading from the author.

886
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,380
Why did Ge Yu Yang say you're here so suddenly?

887
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,380
I know that ordinary days are long.

888
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,380
I only found it this morning.

889
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,380
Jia'er, where is the fire basin?

890
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,380
Forget about the fire.

891
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,380
Fine. I'll go and take care of the girl.

892
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,380
Fine. I'll take care of the girl.

893
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,380
Here she comes.

894
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,380
Good boy.

895
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,380
Third Brother, go and get the lanterns.

896
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,380
This...

897
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,380
Isn't Ah Li also here?

898
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,380
Why don't you take care of her?

899
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,380
Ah Li is the same.

900
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,380
She is the great benefactor of our family.

901
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,380
I don't want to leave her alone.

902
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,380
Hurry up.

903
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,380
Don't be so impulsive.

904
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,380
I'll take care of her.

905
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,380
Madam, the master is back.

906
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,380
Madam!

907
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,380
Ah Li!

908
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,380
I'm back!

909
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,380
Stop! Stop! Stop!

910
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,380
Come again!

911
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,380
The fire basin is here.

912
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,380
Put it here.

913
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,380
Let your father have a look.

914
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,380
He'll be back soon.

915
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,380
Why didn't you bring the girl here earlier?

916
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,380
I need to re-serve my emotions.

917
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,380
It's on fire.

918
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,380
What are you doing?

919
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,380
Come back.

920
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,380
Come on.

921
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,380
Madam!

922
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,820
Ah Li!

923
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,380
Madam!

924
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,380
I miss you so much.

925
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,380
I miss you more.

926
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,380
I miss you more.

927
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,380
I miss you more.

928
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,380
I miss you more.

929
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,380
I miss you more.

930
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,380
That's enough.

931
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,380
There are two more of you.

932
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,380
Third Brother.

933
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,380
You have made a big contribution this time.

934
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,380
You're so thoughtful.

935
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,380
Thank you, Father.

936
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,380
I'm glad to see you.

937
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,380
Yeah.

938
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,380
Thank you, Father.

939
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,700
You've lost your job.

940
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,060
Brother,

941
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,660
we're not polite.

942
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,700
Third Brother,

943
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,940
you've been out for so long,

944
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,860
and you're not getting any progress.

945
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,820
You're getting old.

946
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,380
If you can't stand it,

947
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,860
then hurry up and beg me.

948
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,500
I can't stand it.

949
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:51,980
Second Uncle.

950
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,380
Li.

951
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,020
Second Uncle.

952
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,780
Thank you for your hard work.

953
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,220
I was so worried about you.

954
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,580
Now I see

955
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,260
I'm a man

956
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,500
who's a man.

957
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,540
I'm sorry.

958
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,580
Second Uncle,

959
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,620
I'm sorry.

960
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,460
If Li's mother was still alive,

961
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,100
I wouldn't have

962
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,860
lost my job.

963
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,300
It's just that

964
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,700
I've been in trouble.

965
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,260
But I've lost a lot of money and jewelry.

966
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,260
The world is being watched by His Majesty

967
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,220
in the capital.

968
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,220
These jewelry

969
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,940
are all in the hands of our family.

970
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,380
Don't worry about them.

971
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,260
Back then,

972
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,180
I was young

973
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,540
and said others were old.

974
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,300
I hurt my grandmother and my uncle.

975
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,980
Until now,

976
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,580
I'm ashamed of myself.

977
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,300
I'm so ashamed of myself.

978
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,940
I'd like to give you a chance

979
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,420
to be normal.

980
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,380
It's not your fault.

981
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,100
You were so young.

982
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,380
We should have been elders

983
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,820
to understand your situation.

984
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,300
Now I think

985
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,980
you should be young

986
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,460
and be a good choice for Jiang family.

987
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,100
Especially that Ji Shuran.

988
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,700
I...

989
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,420
I didn't mean to

990
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,780
remind you of your sad story.

991
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,100
I've been with Li for these days.

992
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,940
I only think she's gentle and lovely.

993
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:14,980
She's not like

994
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,220
the person who would kill the emperor.

995
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,780
She must be killed by Ji Shuran.

996
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,500
Jia'er.

997
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,180
It's okay, aunt.

998
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,820
It's not a matter of the past.

999
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,020
The most important thing is to be a good person.

1000
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,620
It's a matter of the past.

1001
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,500
Let Li see her mother soon.

1002
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,060
Yes.

1003
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,500
Li should see her mother soon.

1004
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,020
Now,

1005
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,300
can she bear

1006
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,620
her mother's health?

1007
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,980
You told me this so late.

1008
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,980
I can't bear it.

1009
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,900
Mother.

1010
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,580
Mother.

1011
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,940
Why are you here?

1012
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,700
It's so hard.

1013
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,140
Let her see you.

1014
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,100
Mother.

1015
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,660
I'm so young.

1016
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,980
Li can come to see me.

1017
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,620
I'm so happy.

1018
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,060
Mother, don't blame me.

1019
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,620
Li did something wrong last year.

1020
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:11,780
You...

1021
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,660
You're the grandson of our family.

1022
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,500
You're like a general.

1023
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,220
Li.

1024
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,780
Don't worry.

1025
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,580
I forgive you.

1026
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,380
I'm not in love with you.

1027
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,100
Except your mother, Ye Zhenzhen,

1028
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,460
there are so many people

1029
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,940
who miss you.

1030
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,700
You don't know it.

1031
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:51,900
And you.

1032
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,500
You're enough.

1033
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,820
Since you're back,

1034
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,100
I'll help you.

1035
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,540
Just like this time,

1036
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,260
we'll be together again.

1037
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,460
We'll work hard.

1038
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:05,820
Mother.

1039
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,380
Son,

1040
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,180
you're tired.

1041
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,700
Come back.

1042
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,100
I'll be waiting for you

1043
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,700
at home.

1044
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:19,820
Mother.

1045
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,020
This...

1046
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,860
It's my brother.

1047
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,460
He's not here with her.

1048
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,980
If he wants to borrow money,

1049
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:27,940
I'll do it.

1050
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:28,940
I'll be back.

1051
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,500
Ye,

1052
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,540
don't think that I won't teach you.

1053
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,140
You're the one who taught you.

1054
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,460
You're crazy

1055
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,060
after you're back.

1056
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:37,860
Stop.

1057
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:38,980
You're still here.

1058
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:39,620
I can't fight.

1059
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,780
Stop.

1060
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,580
You're still here.

1061
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:42,980
Stop.

1062
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:43,980
Stop.

1063
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,260
You're black.

1064
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,220
Don't hold her.

1065
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,220
If you and Zhao are still here,

1066
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,820
Li did something wrong.

1067
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,260
You'll forgive her.

1068
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,820
But in the world,

1069
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,900
it's not enough

1070
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,740
to forgive Li.

1071
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,100
Li,

1072
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:15,580
don't cry.

1073
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,700
You're back.

1074
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,900
Li, you're back.

1075
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,340
Li, you're back.

1076
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,340
Li, you're back.
