1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When the spring color is still the same

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Moon's Love

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What's all this?

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Xu Zhi, thank you.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No, thanks.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Zhiyan Wei, the Poison Master will be the one to share the burden.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As long as you pass this level,

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll keep you safe and rich.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you, Poison Master.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Who told you to come out with me?

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Didn't I tell you to stay at home with Princess?

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What's wrong with her?

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She's looking for you everywhere.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The maid is in the house.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why is she looking for me?

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You're the Prince Consort.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who is she looking for?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm a...

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If Princess and her children have a long and short life,

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
we'll have to take care of them all.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Father.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Li Jin.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Use your heart.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I understand.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Father said

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
you had something to tell me.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
My stomach hurts for the whole day.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why don't you see your shadow?

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The doctors and the maid are all here.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Princess Cheng.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You can just tell them the truth.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Tell them the truth?

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you my beloved Prince Consort?

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Shouldn't I be the one to serve you?

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm a good person.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll...

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll learn slowly.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Mei Xiang.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go get a basin for Prince Consort.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let her pour me some water

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and wash me a little.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll go get some water.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What?

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're not willing to?

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Why don't I ask Li Zhongnan to come over

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and let her teach you how to wash your feet?

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No need.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll do it myself.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're a good person.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Give her a few colors

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and light up the lamp.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You should teach her well.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Or else

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you won't learn the rules.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The imperial edict has been ordered to

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
send the Duke Su out of the palace.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You're all ready.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Cheng.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What's going on in the Palace?

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Sister, do you know

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the guards of the guards

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
surrounded the Palace

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and the guards of the Prince Consort.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If General Xiao didn't come over to persuade her,

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
she would have caused trouble.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The Duke Su is now under control.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Sister, you haven't seen her, have you?

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
She was locked up in the bedroom behind.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's said that His Majesty ordered

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
not to let her come out.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Sister, I haven't eaten yet.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Sister.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Sister.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Sister.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Everyone, I gave the Duke Su food.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Thank you.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Duke Su,

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you look like

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
you're locked up.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I know you're asking.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Say it.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What?

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What did you say?

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're not the one

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
who's not in the family.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The play?

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're in power?

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A play that's a military-based rebellion?

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Smart.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
How long are you going to be locked up?

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Two days.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So short?

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The play can't be over.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Otherwise, it will cause people to doubt.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's a good thing

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
to be able to get the medicine.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So you're acting with General Xiao?

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He doesn't deserve to be acting with me.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Then why...

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't want to mention him.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Since that's the case,

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm leaving.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Isn't this for me?

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is for my brother.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll send it to him later.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I thought you came to see me

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
because you were worried about me.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I didn't expect

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'd get it wrong again.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You didn't get it wrong.

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I did come to see you

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
because I was worried about you.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Consort Xu, wait a minute.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Consort Xu.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Why are you here?

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You can't go in?

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The kitchen is in the room

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and the imperial guards are watching.

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We can't enter these security guards.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why are you here?

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I was about to ask you guys.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I heard that General Xiao Heng

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and General Xiao

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
were fighting each other.

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
In the case of them,

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
they were both grandfathers.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They looked like enemies.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Shut up.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The second wife is not an outsider.

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Besides,

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
it's been so many years.

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
They still can't get over it.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Maybe

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
she has a way.

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
General Han's death

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
has always been a new thing

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
for our main army.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
After General Han died,

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
the common man,

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Peng Fu Jiang,

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
had found the old general.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Are you serious?

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Did you hear what I said?

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I swear

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I didn't lie.

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
General,

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
they were angry with me.

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They could have saved General.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
they didn't send troops to support us.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Instead,

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
they killed General.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The only way to retreat.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Later,

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
the situation was in the court.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The main army was unwilling to see the development.

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
General.

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
General Xiao Ming Han

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and Long Wu Jun can't die.

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I beg you to re-dead.

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Re-dead Long Wu Jun.

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The Prince of Chen is a good boy.

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He wants General to leave the mountain.

181
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Once General is accepted,

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
it means that

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
General Xiao is dead in front of everyone.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Peng Fu Jiang thinks

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the old general will definitely be here

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
to reveal the secret of Prince of Chen.

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
leave the mountain

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and re-dead Long Wu Jun.

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I hope Peng Fu Jiang

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
will only investigate

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
the behind-the-scenes of General Xiao's death.

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But even what my father

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
himself has recognized,

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
how could he still have a chance?

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Peng Fu was accused of

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the treason and miscarriage of the prince.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He was finally found out

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
that the army was captured

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and executed.

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The only person who knew the truth

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
was dead.

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Why didn't you let me investigate?

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You were watching my father

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
die and kill him.

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You are a big bastard.

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
General,

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
because Long Wu Jun

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
was captured by the Jin Rui clan,

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
he was killed by the Jin Rui clan.

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So General

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,620
immediately became a

213
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,000
commoner from the Jiejia Gui Tian

214
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and became a member of the Jin army.

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He was so bright and bright

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
in his life.

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Since then,

218
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
we have been separated

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
from General Xiao.

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He was like Peng Fu Jiang.

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He had to investigate

222
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and give his father a justice.

223
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But he was stopped by General Xiao.

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He was imprisoned in the Palace of the State

225
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
for five years.

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
In the past five years,

227
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
except for the flowers and grass,

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
he was not afraid of the rain.

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He was so brave.

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He was so lucky

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
in his life.

232
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I see.

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I want to see General.

234
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You are here for Xiao Heng, right?

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
General,

236
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that is Duke Su.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That is General Xiao Ming Han.

238
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That is...

239
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This is Heng's mother,

240
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yu Hongye.

241
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
She was originally a musician in the school.

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
She was with Ming Han in the south.

243
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
She was a musician in the school.

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
She was a musician in the school.

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
She was a musician in the school.

246
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That was a good song.

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Her family was in Nanjiang.

248
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
She couldn't see me for a year.

249
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So I invited a painter.

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I drew this painting.

251
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I will make a thought.

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So these are...

253
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
My son used to use the helmet.

254
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
My helmet.

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And that one.

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Her wife used to sing and play.

257
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And this one.

258
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This is the toy

259
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Heng likes the most.

260
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He won't let go of it.

261
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And these wines.

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Heng's father likes them the most.

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I made them and sent them to the camp.

264
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But now...

265
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
General, you always watch these?

266
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's like...

267
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I bet you're a bad person.

268
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It seems that in General's heart,

269
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Duke Su loves you a lot.

270
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I have heard a few things about the past.

271
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't know if I can hear the past

272
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
from General's mouth.

273
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What identity do you have to ask about this?

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Heng's...

275
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Kind heart.

276
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He is also my kind heart.

277
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You're much better than him.

278
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Can you hear the past from General's mouth?

279
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I think so.

280
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But you can ask someone.

281
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If you want to keep it secret,

282
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
you can't tell Heng.

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He knows it's bad.

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
General.

285
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I think it's good and bad.

286
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Duke Su should be the one to be the one to be the one.

287
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't eat cold food these days.

288
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm so hungry.

289
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's disgusting to watch.

290
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's disgusting.

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't you know that I don't eat scary food?

292
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why do you add this to my food?

293
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Here.

294
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Eat it.

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm so busy.

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This is the shrimp I picked for you.

297
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You just waste it on the ground.

298
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Eat it.

299
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What?

300
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Eat it.

301
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm so hungry.

302
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Eat it.

303
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Princess Zhan.

304
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You're too much for me.

305
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
How can I be?

306
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Can't you

307
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
understand a woman who is pregnant

308
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and say she's helpless?

309
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's actually very simple.

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
If you don't want to eat the shrimp on the ground,

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
you can apologize to me.

312
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Say you'll listen to me.

313
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I won't be a part of your waste.

314
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Princess Chen.

315
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I respect your status.

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But remember.

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It doesn't mean

318
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I can do anything to you.

319
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I can apologize to you.

320
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But I'm not Shen Yurong.

321
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'll get you!

322
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You're crazy!

323
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Shen Yurong is your dog.

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But I'm not.

325
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
My husband is a minister in the court.

326
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
He's a commoner.

327
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I hope you understand.

328
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm not a minister.

329
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I hope you understand.

330
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What are you talking about?

331
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Do you deserve it?

332
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Do you deserve Shen Lang?

333
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm telling you.

334
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You're as good as a cat.

335
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Do you know that?

336
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If so,

337
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't understand

338
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
the eyes of Princess Zhan.

339
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You can go to Shen Lang.

340
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Go.

341
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You...

342
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Everyone.

343
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I gave it to Duke Su.

344
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This is Duke Su's relative.

345
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They haven't seen each other for a long time.

346
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Let them in.

347
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They won't trouble you.

348
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's a long story.

349
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's a long story.

350
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We can't be bothered.

351
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Thank you.

352
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Thank you.

353
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I didn't expect you to grow up so big.

354
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Young Master.

355
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Mother Wang.

356
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Why are you here?

357
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I didn't expect you to remember me

358
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
for so many years.

359
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Of course I remember.

360
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You were always taking care of me

361
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
when my parents passed away.

362
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I just don't know why you left suddenly.

363
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Young Master.

364
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What are you doing?

365
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Get up.

366
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Young Master.

367
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Do you remember when you were a kid,

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
you had a fever and a fever.

369
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You had a fever and a fever.

370
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You had a fever and a fever.

371
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Do you remember?

372
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The old man was busy with work

373
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and locked me up in the house.

374
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You were the only one who took care of me.

375
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Actually, that time,

376
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I was the one who poisoned you.

377
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What?

378
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Luckily, I found out that

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
the doctor took the medicine.

380
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Young Master was asleep.

381
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
This kid is very naughty.

382
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He has caused you a lot of trouble.

383
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No trouble.

384
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Young Master has always been a good boy.

385
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why did you kill him?

386
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The medicine was found in your room.

387
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You don't want to kill him.

388
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Tell me.

389
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I can help you.

390
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
General.

391
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm sorry, Young Master.

392
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But I can't do anything.

393
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
My child is still in their hands.

394
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
General.

395
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
General, I was threatened.

396
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I didn't chase after him.

397
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And I left the capital.

398
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I gave him a little more money.

399
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
He hoped that he would have a chance

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
to prove himself

401
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
when he was investigating for General Xiao.

402
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But I didn't wait until he found me.

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Until yesterday,

404
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
this lady found me.

405
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
He really did.

406
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
He wanted to investigate for my father.

407
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes.

408
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
General has been very concerned about me these years.

409
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He also said a lot about

410
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
the relationship between General Xiao and me.

411
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
General is really very fond of General Xiao.

412
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I think that the King of Cheng

413
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
should be the one who poisoned you

414
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
to threaten General Xiao.

415
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
General really wanted to protect you back then.

416
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
How do you know that?

417
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He is not a play before.

418
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Is it a play?

419
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You can watch it yourself.

420
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm afraid that you haven't been to his house

421
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
in the past.

422
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
After the competition tomorrow,

423
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
you can go with me.

424
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
No matter what,

425
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
you should go with me

426
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
to the Hall of Justice.

427
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay?

428
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Doctor,

429
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
is there anything else?

430
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Princess, please calm down.

431
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let me explain it to you.

432
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Please don't be in a hurry.

433
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Your Majesty,

434
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I have a question

435
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
for your knowledge.

436
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You don't know

437
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
that numerous medical care enthusiasts

438
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,340
have been exposed to

439
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,000
treatment in the hospital.

440
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Every treatment can be cured.

441
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's why

442
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
we have Gathered

443
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,300
the Imperial Guards

444
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,000
to assist you in this Minneète.

445
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
To do that,

446
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
we must come to the Old Town to anderer me,

447
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You are the winner of the Imperial Hospital.

448
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Who else can I find to support?

449
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Think of another way.

450
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I have opened the secret room of God of Peace.

451
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Please take care of the emotions of the Princess.

452
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You two, take your time.

453
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm back. I'm back.

454
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Shut up.

455
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Go,차�as' son.

456
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,400
Go, adalah dun' t Scientists

457
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
This is...

458
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,400
That is what I asked the painter to do for you.

459
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,400
I didn't expect you to stay.

460
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,400
So, to me, you are the most sincere person I have ever been.

461
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
The most sincere person?

462
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,400
So when Peng Shu told you the truth about my father's death,

463
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
how did you treat your sincere person?

464
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
You are still trying to get rid of Prince Cheng and Prince Cheng?

465
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Nonsense.

466
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,400
How could I kill my son's murderer and get rid of Prince Cheng?

467
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
You only know that Prince Cheng killed your father,

468
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,400
but you don't know how he killed him.

469
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Why?

470
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Why did you retreat?

471
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
We didn't have such a situation in the past.

472
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
We only need to hold on for a few more days.

473
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,400
When Yuan Bin arrives, we will definitely guard the capital.

474
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,400
If we let it go, Yuan Bin will be in trouble.

475
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
We don't have enough provisions.

476
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,400
We don't need to guard this city for our Buji.

477
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,400
What we should do now is to retreat to the city and meet with Yuan Bin.

478
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Then we will kill them and take back Wang Cheng.

479
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Are you afraid of death?

480
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm not afraid of death.

481
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
I don't want to be a useless sacrifice.

482
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Then the people of Wang Cheng,

483
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
aren't they dead?

484
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Once we retreat, the enemy will be like a stranger.

485
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,400
After we break the city, we will kill them.

486
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Then the people of the city will be like a stranger.

487
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
We are the leaders.

488
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,400
We can fight to protect the peace.

489
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
We can fight to death.

490
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
But we can't give up.

491
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
You don't have to say it.

492
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm the commander.

493
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
I've made my decision.

494
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,400
In today's situation, the whole army must retreat to Wang Cheng.

495
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
My Dragon King.

496
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
No.

497
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
The army is like mountains.

498
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Do you want to see them be punished by the army?

499
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
General.

500
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,400
I've already told Dragon King and Prince Cheng to retreat to Wang Cheng.

501
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,400
In this way, the army we have left won't reach 200 people.

502
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
We will report to the front.

503
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
The enemy will be like us.

504
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
We won't reach 30 people.

505
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
General.

506
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
You keep 100 soldiers.

507
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
And take care of the people.

508
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
It's too late, General.

509
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,400
There is a road ahead.

510
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
It's a place where the government and the government can be separated.

511
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,400
The rest 100 soldiers follow me.

512
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
As long as the road is blocked,

513
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
and the people are safe,

514
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,400
the people can leave.

515
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
What should we do?

516
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Will the army come to save you?

517
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
It doesn't matter.

518
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
I have my life.

519
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Go.

520
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
General.

521
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
General.

522
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
General.

523
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
The people of Wang Cheng have all retreated.

524
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Let's retreat.

525
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
General.

526
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
The enemy is coming.

527
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
General.

528
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Go to the river valley on the north.

529
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
We can return to Wang Cheng.

530
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,400
The gate of Wang Cheng is closed.

531
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
We can't go back.

532
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
What?

533
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Why do you close the gate?

534
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Wang Cheng's decision.

535
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Wang Cheng wants us to die.

536
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,400
I shouldn't have let him go.

537
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
General.

538
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Brothers.

539
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,400
This war is a war.

540
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
If so,

541
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,400
we don't need to be a burden to the people.

542
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Hanguang.

543
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Yes.

544
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,400
I want you to remember the name of our army.

545
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Tell General Xiao.

546
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
We are so lucky to be the people.

547
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
We have no fault in the emperor.

548
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
We didn't let the enemy down.

549
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
No.

550
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
General.

551
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
I won't go.

552
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
I want to fight with you.

553
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
I will fight with you.

554
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Only you can take back the wrong.

555
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Go.

556
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
I won't go.

557
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
General.

558
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
General.

559
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Father.

560
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Let's go.

561
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
I won't go.

562
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Father.

563
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
General.

564
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Father.

565
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
General.

566
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Go.

567
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Go.

568
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Long Wu Jun.

569
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Yes.

570
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
This war is not over.

571
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Yes.

572
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Go.

573
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Hanguang.

574
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Hanguang.

575
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,400
In order to prevent others from knowing

576
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,400
that he is not good enough to the people,

577
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,400
he broke father's way.

578
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
He forced father to die.

579
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Father didn't die.

580
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
He was abandoned.

581
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
He was killed.

582
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
You knew it.

583
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Why didn't you go to investigate?

584
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Prince Cheng.

585
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
You have turned you into

586
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
my soft-blooded man.

587
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
As long as you have a good will,

588
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
a man like mother Wang

589
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
will kill you.

590
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
They need to take this father

591
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
to the dead

592
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
and take him to the dead.

593
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
You should cover their lies.

594
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
So he didn't

595
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,400
kill us.

596
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
You were so young at that time.

597
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
You only saw me re-enact the army.

598
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
You didn't know anything about the next thing.

599
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Now you are grown up.

600
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
You still know the death.

601
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
Then why didn't you let me

602
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
investigate the death of the Qing army?

603
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
You want to cover up

604
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
the scruples you personally mentioned.

605
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Do you know

606
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
he has already colluded with Prince Cheng?

607
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
I don't know.

608
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Why?

609
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
I asked you to release Xu Zhi.

610
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
He told me a year ago.

611
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Zhang Wei and Beijing have a communication.

612
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
I told him

613
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
not to give birth to a father.

614
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
He should be investigated first.

615
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
He is the spy

616
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
of the Qing army

617
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
I have to protect him.

618
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

619
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Did you give me the chance?

620
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
Since you were a monk,

621
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,400
I have locked you up in the State Palace.

622
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
You didn't listen to me.

623
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
I don't care

624
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,400
about your age.

625
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
I care about you.

626
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
I want to be older

627
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
and tell you the reason.

628
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Who would have thought

629
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
it would be so hard

630
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
to get rid of the jieyi.

631
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
It's too difficult.

632
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
You know it.

633
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
I told you so many things.

634
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
I don't want you to understand

635
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
and forgive me.

636
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
I just want to tell you.

637
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Xu Zhi

638
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
is not

639
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
the person of the King of Chang.

640
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Understand?

641
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
I can't understand.

642
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
I can clearly say

643
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
what I have to say.

644
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
But you have been away

645
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
for so many years.

646
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Do you remember

647
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,400
the name of the 100 soldiers?

648
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
I remember every one of them.

649
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
I can clearly remember them.

650
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Okay.

651
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
What are you doing?

652
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
It's not easy

653
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
to get back the justice for them.

654
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Jiang Li can study for Xue Huaiyuan.

655
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Why can't I

656
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
give my father a justice?

657
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Is it possible

658
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
that I can't even compare

659
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
with a woman?

660
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
You're so funny.

661
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,400
You're so handsome.

662
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
That girl is not bad.

663
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
She's good enough for you.

664
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Come with me.

665
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
The King of Chang is about to enter the capital.

666
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
You've been living with me

667
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
in the Duke's mansion for a while.

668
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Don't misunderstand.

669
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
I just don't want to help you clean up.

670
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
You're so handsome.

671
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Go home.

672
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Go home.

673
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
What are you talking about?

674
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Say it again.

675
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Go home.

676
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Go home.

677
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Go home.

678
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Go home.

679
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
Mr. Shen.

680
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
You've found the medicine

681
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
that you've been trying to get rid of.

682
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Is it the kind that I'm looking for?

683
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Yes.

684
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
This medicine only exists in the Great Zhao.

685
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
In the past,

686
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
it was often used to cure cold symptoms.

687
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
But it was too much.

688
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
It would make people feel guilty.

689
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Injury?

690
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
Will it cause a stomachache

691
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
and make the outside world feel sick?

692
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
That's right.

693
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
The person who takes the medicine

694
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,400
does have a similar pulse to the one in Ximai.

695
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
There's even a small-scale operation

696
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
in the end.

697
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,400
I've asked many doctors in the city

698
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
about the medicine.

699
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
In the past,

700
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
there were many misunderstandings

701
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
in the alley.

702
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,400
So the harm and the power of the medicine

703
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,400
are less and less.

704
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
As for now,

705
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,400
some people know that

706
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
I bought this herb

707
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,400
from the Great Zhao.

708
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
So I've delayed some time.

709
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
How long will it take to remove the medicine?

710
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
About a month.

711
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
I've asked you to give me your blessing

712
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
and ask you to be polite to Princess Zhang

713
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
and keep a good road for yourself.

714
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
You never listen to me.

715
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
No.

716
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
I did.

717
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
It's all Princess Zhang's doing.

718
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Princess Zhang's doing.

719
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
You didn't see that

720
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
she could...

721
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
People.

722
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Didn't I ask you to bear it?

723
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
How can I bear it?

724
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
I've already made her

725
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
protect me in front of me.

726
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
So I'm going to be

727
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
the one who's going to jump off the bridge.

728
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
I...

729
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
She's on the ground to get the medicine.

730
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Do you like it, my lord?

731
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Are you satisfied?

732
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Our family is also a family.

733
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
I can't face it.

734
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
My lord,

735
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
don't you want your face?

736
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
You're a bastard.

737
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
What should I do?

738
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
What should I do?

739
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
She's gone.

740
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Gone.

741
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
It's because you quarreled with her.

742
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
She's gone.

743
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
No one can save us.

744
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
We must die.

745
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
My lord.

746
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Since that,

747
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,400
I'll go find Princess Zhang to punish her.

748
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Princess Zhang?

749
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Yes.

750
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
It's not like she's touched my head.

751
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Don't worry, father.

752
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
I won't hold back my tears.

753
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
If you...

754
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Lei Xin!

755
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
You can do it.

756
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Since you dare to do it yourself,

757
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
you'll die for it.

758
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
You Li's father

759
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
killed my father's child.

760
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
You'll be buried.

761
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Princess Zhang!

762
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Wait.

763
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Princess Zhang,

764
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
we don't want this to happen.

765
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Right?

766
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
This is a misunderstanding.

767
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Misunderstanding?

768
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Are you using these words

769
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
to kill my child?

770
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
I've done this before.

771
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
I'm sorry for you.

772
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
I'll punish her

773
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
for 20 times.

774
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
How is it?

775
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Lei Zhongnan,

776
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
if I have to die today,

777
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
what can I do?

778
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Princess Zhang,

779
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,400
my little son is in the temple.

780
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
I only have this one child.

781
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Princess Zhang,

782
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
please take care of her.

783
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Please take care of her.

784
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Father.

785
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
You love your son.

786
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Why don't you want to

787
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
have a child like me?

788
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
You little bastard.

789
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
I'll kill you today.

790
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Let go of me.

791
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Princess Zhang.

792
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Princess Zhang.

793
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Even if we get into the city,

794
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,400
I can't just watch you

795
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
kill my son.

796
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Come on.

797
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Get up.

798
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Lei Zhongnan, you dare to do it?

799
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Stop.

800
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Why are you here?

801
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
Shen Yusheng,

802
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
how dare you come to our family?

803
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
You're too arrogant.

804
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
We've been caught.

805
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
Caught?

806
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
What's the situation?

807
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Please, everyone,

808
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
leave the medicine.

809
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
All of you, leave.

810
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Get out.

811
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
This is the medicine for the birth of a baby.

812
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
No one uses it in the feast.

813
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
I also asked the doctor to help me

814
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
to find it.

815
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
The doctor said that the medicine is given to you.

816
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
It will give you a fake pregnancy

817
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
in a month.

818
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
If you don't believe me,

819
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
you can find someone to try it.

820
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
No way.

821
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
I've tried it before.

822
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
It's impossible.

823
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Where's the birthday of Consort Lv?

824
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Come on.

825
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Let's drink.

826
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Princess Zhang, you're rarely in the palace.

827
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
This cup of red wine

828
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
is specially prepared for you.

829
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,000
Cl Potter

830
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
This medicine is only for YOU United.

831
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,600
You have to remember

832
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
the princess of the royal court?

833
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,400
Her good Sponge

834
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
is also a little better than Consort Xue.

835
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
What aFlict upon trying!

836
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,120
What a little easy for1000 meal!

837
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
I thought

838
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
I can't help you.

839
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
We were fooled by him.

840
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
Your Highness,

841
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
please forgive me for my impudence.

842
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Get out of here.

843
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Both of you, get out of here.

844
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Yes.

845
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Let's go.

846
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Meixiao.

847
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
I'll tell Prince Cheng.

848
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Tell Prince Cheng to prepare someone for him.

849
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Yes.

850
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
No matter what,

851
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
you're in a bad state.

852
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
I want to be in a good mood.

853
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Just tell me what to do.

854
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
This child.

855
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
It's the gift from God.

856
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
My child is gone.

857
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Gone.

858
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Our child is gone.

859
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
It's okay.

860
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
As long as we're together,

861
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
we'll be together.

862
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,400
It's okay.

863
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
I won't have a child again.

864
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Hurry up.

865
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Hurry up.

866
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
Don't move.

867
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Don't move.

868
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Don't move.

869
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Don't move.

870
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Don't move.

871
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Don't move.

872
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Don't move.

873
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Don't move.

874
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Don't move.

875
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Don't move.

876
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Don't move.

877
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,400
This child is from the country of Dai.

878
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
He dares to kill my great Yan.

879
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
I'll pay for it.

880
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,400
These are the wealth they've taken from you.

881
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
I'll take them back for you.

882
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,400
If they dare to come again,

883
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,400
I'll kill one of them.

884
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Your Majesty.

885
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Your Majesty.

886
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Your Majesty.

887
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Your Majesty.

888
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Your Majesty.

889
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Your Majesty.

890
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,400
His Highness has given all the wealth he has brought to the people.

891
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
The imperial army is going to be in trouble.

892
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Since the gold mine was sealed,

893
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Li Xiangguo has lost his news.

894
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,400
The provisions in our army

895
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
can't last long.

896
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
What are you afraid of?

897
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Your Highness.

898
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,400
The imperial army will be able to

899
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,400
hand over the wealth of Longwu Army.

900
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
Longwu Army?

901
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,400
You did a good job.

902
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
If it weren't for Xiao Minghan

903
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,400
carrying Longwu Army,

904
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
I wouldn't have had a bitter son

905
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
who has been in Beijing for so long.

906
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,400
It's alright.

907
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
I'm here for revenge.

908
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Your Majesty.

909
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,400
Your Majesty.

910
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,400
Your Majesty.

911
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,400
Your Majesty.

912
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Your Majesty.

913
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
Your Majesty.

914
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,400
Your Majesty.

915
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,320
Master,

916
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,200
you asked me to watch father

917
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,600
send the throne to Zhao Ye.

918
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,880
I've been fighting for father for so many years.

919
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,080
I've been hurt and exhausted.

920
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,480
He's a child.

921
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,560
He's sitting on the throne peacefully.

922
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,520
If you assassinate Zhao Ye now,

923
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,720
we'll be punished by the army.

924
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,120
When he's not in the position,

925
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,320
the court will be in danger.

926
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,400
Even Huo Lian will be defeated.

927
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,600
Who are you going to choose with Zhao Ye?

928
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,400
The Dragon Army is out there.

929
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,920
You have no chance.

930
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,280
You're both in the hands of the army.

931
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,360
I'll let you go.

932
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,640
Go back to the JR army.

933
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,720
Brother Zhao Ye has a doctor.

934
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,000
Long Wu forces

935
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,720
of Luo Lin and Long King

936
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,640
esc phones for the Zan Fu army

937
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,880
will attack Zhao Ye's car.

938
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,720
Guard Zhao Yue has sent a south side introduction.

939
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,480
We've made up the plan.

940
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,120
Congratulations on your promotion, Your Highness.

941
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,040
חoks機會

942
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,360
For the years we worked here,

943
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,320
we auxiliate thousands of dead soldiers on the battlefield.

944
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,440
What did the court give us?

945
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,440
Shaofeng...

946
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,600
This collar...

947
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,900
