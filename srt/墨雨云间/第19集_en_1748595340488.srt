1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't admit it

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When the spring color is still the same

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 1

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Bastard, you're pissing me off.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If you hadn't stopped me, I would have killed that dog-nose.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Shut up. I'm going out.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sister, Tong'er, I know that immortal.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're a good man.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I entrusted you with the responsibility of managing Liang Cang.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You're a good man.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You're a good man.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're a official now.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You don't deserve to be a official.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Feng Yutang was a drug dealer.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My father pity him.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He left him in the county office.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He's very smart.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I didn't expect that he's a bad man.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
A smart immortal.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is hard to deal with.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Do you have any idea?

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Feng Yutang changed all the coffin he had.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why don't you look at me?

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Are you okay?

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He's the one in the county office?

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We call him the mute.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Maybe Feng Yutang thinks he's a mute.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He left him.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But can he really help us?

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Since he invited me,

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll go to the county office.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll go to the county office.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll go to the county office.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll go to the county office.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Since he invited me,

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
he has something to tell me.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Sanjiu, take Tong Er with you.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll go to the lady.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No, let's go together.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No, Feng Yutang has been watching us.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We have to separate.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Listen to me.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Listen to me.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Tong Er and I have changed.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm the one who's watching them.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't know what's wrong with Tong Er.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We'll meet here after an hour.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you don't come back,

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll take Tong Er to you.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's go.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Please, lady.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Go.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's go.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's go.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We've come to the county office.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Send someone to follow us.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Others will wait.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There's a fire in the city.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes, yes, yes.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm smart.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay.

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You two go there.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Go.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's go there.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Go.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Little beauty.

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're alone.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Little beauty.

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Beautiful.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're so lovely.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm the one who's the beauty.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm here.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Little beauty is so lovely.

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Big brother, come here.

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Get up.

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Little beauty.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Big brother likes it.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hit me. Hit me.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Little beauty.

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Big brother.

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're so lovely.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let go.

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let go.

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let go.

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Let go.

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Let go.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let go.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sorry.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I fell off the fan.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Please help me cut the cake.

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll do it.

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're the one who's the beauty.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You're the one who's the beauty.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Jia'er, you're the one who's the beauty.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You, you're the one who's the beauty.

109
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Duke Su,

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
how did you change your name today?

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Do you like it?

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Little beauty.

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You...

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I heard that you're coming to Huaixiang.

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So I'm here.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I think

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you should ask

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
you this question.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm here.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm here.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm here.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm here.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm here.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm here.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm here.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm here.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm here.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I came to Huaixiang to ask if there's any important matter.

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Maybe it's a bit late.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What is it?

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It doesn't matter.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What is the important matter that you just mentioned?

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'll explain it to you in a few days.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm being watched.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Can I do something good?

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Over there.

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
Enjoy your meal with me.

138
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,360
I will Sally my daughter on the Auchess s Kiln,

139
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,760
and I will separate the game to have a drink.

140
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,540
It would be really good if the game ends.

141
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,760
If you like their art,

142
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,420
then of course I do.

143
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
Come and have a look.

144
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,220
Go and have tea with me.

145
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,660
Madam, do you want some flowers?

146
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,020
No.

147
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,260
Come and have a look.

148
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,940
I'll give you a gift.

149
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,260
It's cheaper.

150
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,220
Come here.

151
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,780
Do you like this gift?

152
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,140
It's a little bit ugly.

153
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,060
Have a good look.

154
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
Teach them to mis 굉장히 in private.

155
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,020
Write their epitomes.

156
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,620
The Second Madam of the Yakتong people

157
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,260
at Huai 현 about pensions.

158
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,260
They do it.

159
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,420
is the beginning of the story.

160
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,420
The true value is not important.

161
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
The important thing is

162
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,420
to see a person's reputation

163
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,420
fall from the cloud

164
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,420
and fall into the mud.

165
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,420
Don't move.

166
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,420
Stay calm.

167
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,420
Why don't you speak well?

168
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,420
You think too much.

169
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,420
I don't like the word

170
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,420
love.

171
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,420
What's wrong with a person with love?

172
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
He can't kill you,

173
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,420
but he can kill me.

174
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
Look at him.

175
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,420
He can't kill you.

176
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,420
I can't kill you.

177
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,420
Are you calm, Xiao Meiniang?

178
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,420
I am calm.

179
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,040
Write for me.

180
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,940
Yuarthai

181
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,940
If you are found again, you will be a pighead.

182
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,940
Get lost.

183
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
Get lost.

184
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,940
Get lost.

185
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,940
Why did you do it with me today?

186
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,940
Didn't you say you didn't like me watching the show on the street?

187
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,940
You have nothing to say today, right?

188
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,940
When Duke Su and the second wife were together,

189
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,940
you didn't like to be watched.

190
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,940
You saved me with your reputation.

191
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,940
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,940
Send her wherever she wants to go.

193
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,940
Don't ask why.

194
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,940
Send her to the door to protect her.

195
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
Until she does everything,

196
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,940
send her home.

197
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,940
Yes.

198
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,940
Luo Xin.

199
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940
Let's go, little beauty.

200
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,940
I'm a fake girl.

201
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,940
I can't do it.

202
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,940
Little girl.

203
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,940
I'm a fake girl.

204
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,940
I can't do it.

205
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
Little girl.

206
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,940
No, little girl.

207
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,940
You have to leave.

208
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,940
Don't go back to Huai Xiang tonight.

209
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
Why?

210
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,940
Feng Yutang can make it work.

211
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,940
She must have been a good girl.

212
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,940
She is not afraid of anything.

213
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,940
You can't beat her.

214
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,940
My identity now

215
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,940
is the second wife of the Zhou Shulin Jiang Yuan Bai family.

216
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,940
Jiang Jiaqi is not low-key.

217
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,940
They dare not touch me.

218
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,940
Your identity will harm Xue Xianyun.

219
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,940
As long as Feng Yutang's blood is not shed,

220
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,940
he will kill her at any time.

221
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,940
I can't let them see it.

222
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,940
I came here for my father.

223
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
I need people now.

224
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,940
I need people who can turn the case against my father.

225
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,940
I need people who can prove that

226
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
Feng Yutang framed my father.

227
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,940
Before they ask for my father,

228
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,940
I can take my father to the hospital.

229
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,940
But

230
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,940
he can't get out of the person you want to find.

231
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,940
Gu Da, Gu Er,

232
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,940
Peng Xiao, He Jun.

233
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,940
Those who have been selfish and selfish

234
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
and have been a good girl

235
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,940
can't save them.

236
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,940
They are all the people who are

237
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,940
the people who are the people of Feng Yutang.

238
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,940
No matter what,

239
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,940
I need to try it.

240
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,940
You can't just clean it up.

241
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,940
Otherwise, Xue Xianyun will suffer more.

242
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,940
I understand.

243
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,940
You are always by Feng Yutang's side.

244
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,940
You are always in danger.

245
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,940
Listen to me.

246
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,940
I will try to send you out.

247
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,940
I suddenly disappeared.

248
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,940
I can't believe that

249
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,940
you are the one who killed Feng Yutang.

250
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
I suddenly disappeared.

251
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,940
You just let it go.

252
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,940
I have been dying for a long time.

253
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,940
If Xue Xianyun didn't save me,

254
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,940
I would have starved to death.

255
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,940
He is my benefactor.

256
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,940
I can't leave.

257
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
Feng Yutang is a bad guy.

258
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,940
I think I am a useless mute.

259
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,940
He didn't kick me out.

260
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,940
But he won't think that

261
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,940
I have been by Xue Xianyun's side all the time.

262
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,940
In a few days,

263
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,940
if they really want to kill Xue Xianyun,

264
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,940
I will lie to them.

265
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,940
Don't.

266
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,940
Take your life and take revenge.

267
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,940
It's the worst.

268
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,940
Since I am back today,

269
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,940
I will make those people and the evil gang...

270
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,940
Yazou.

271
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,940
The End

272
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,940
Thank you, everyone.

273
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,940
Chicken soup,

274
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,940
and rice noodles.

275
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,940
Why are you still standing there?

276
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
Drink it.

277
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,940
You have been stewing for a long time.

278
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,940
Don't be shy.

279
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,940
Drink it while it's hot.

280
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,940
It's still hot.

281
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
Xiaoling.

282
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
Come on.

283
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,940
Drink it.

284
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,940
Come on.

285
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,940
Drink it.

286
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940
Drink it.

287
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,940
I have been stewing for a whole night.

288
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,940
You didn't drink it.

289
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,940
Didn't you waste my heart?

290
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
Who did he meet?

291
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,940
Su... Su...

292
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,940
Why did you come to Huai Xiang?

293
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
Get up.

294
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,940
Su,

295
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,940
you seem to take good care of Jiang Li.

296
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,940
You even went back yourself.

297
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,940
I am afraid that you won't be able to do it well.

298
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,940
I will be more clever in the future.

299
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,940
If I am found again,

300
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,940
it will not be the soup.

301
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,940
I will be more clever.

302
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,940
Go back.

303
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,940
Yes.

304
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Wait.

305
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,940
Go.

306
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,940
Hurry up.

307
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,940
I...

308
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,940
Sister.

309
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,940
Why did you come so late?

310
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,940
Did something happen?

311
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,940
The charcoal in the Feng Yutang's hall was burnt.

312
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,940
I was lucky to meet Xiao Heng.

313
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,940
Who is Xiao Heng?

314
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,940
It's Duke Su.

315
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,940
Why did he come here?

316
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,940
Did he come to see you?

317
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,940
He is...

318
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,940
I will tell him later.

319
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,940
I have heard about the news of Xue Jia'an's lover.

320
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,940
Where is she?

321
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,940
At the Nisha factory in Dongshan.

322
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,940
But now,

323
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,940
Nisha factory is the hands of Feng Yutang.

324
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,940
Sanjiu,

325
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,940
can you find the hands?

326
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,940
I can go back to Lu Yang to find my brothers.

327
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,940
But Feng Yutang has taken our people.

328
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,940
If there is any wind and rain,

329
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,940
he will be like a leader.

330
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,940
Is there any other way?

331
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,940
Well...

332
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,940
There is.

333
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
Master,

334
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,940
the terrain of Nisha factory is clear.

335
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,940
There is a river in the middle of the two mountains.

336
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,940
The river is at Nisha factory.

337
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,940
It goes up and down.

338
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,940
This is the Guanjing mine.

339
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,940
The mine is made by the imperial court.

340
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,940
The Feng Ming is the leader of Huaijiang.

341
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,940
No one can control it without the stone.

342
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,940
The rest...

343
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,940
I haven't found it yet.

344
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,940
Although Nisha factory has been built for half a year,

345
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,940
the Guanjing mine is already open for many years.

346
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,940
The mine is very complicated.

347
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,940
With the land and the sea,

348
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,940
the mine has changed a lot.

349
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,940
It is hard to go without the mine.

350
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,940
You are talking nonsense.

351
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,940
Then you say.

352
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,940
How about the wall palace?

353
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,940
Wall palace?

354
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,940
Yes.

355
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,940
I will go to call my brothers.

356
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,940
Then?

357
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,940
What's your name?

358
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,940
We are in this position.

359
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,940
We can't be shameless.

360
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,940
Don't be a coward.

361
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,940
What do you think?

362
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,940
It's not the right thing to do.

363
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,940
Then you say.

364
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,940
You are here.

365
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,940
You know I want to come.

366
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,940
You are walking on the road.

367
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,940
Li.

368
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,940
I want to borrow some people's hands.

369
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,940
Come with me to Dongshan Nisha factory.

370
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
Interesting.

371
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,940
Your eyes are also falling back.

372
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,940
This is my key.

373
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
You want people to be hard.

374
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,940
But I have to understand my matter first.

375
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,940
Then I can help you.

376
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,940
My matter is urgent.

377
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,940
I can't wait for Aunt Su.

378
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,940
Jiang Er.

379
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,940
Don't be too hard on me.

380
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,940
Then tell me.

381
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
What do you want to know?

382
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,940
There is a crazy official mine in Nisha factory.

383
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,940
Official mine?

384
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,940
You want to go down the mine?

385
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,940
We can't go down now.

386
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,940
We don't have a mine.

387
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,940
A mine?

388
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
Wait for me.

389
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,940
I want to know the origin of my drawing.

390
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,940
I can't say.

391
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,940
But I can guarantee it with my life.

392
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,940
Is this drawing real?

393
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,940
I've heard this too many times.

394
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,940
Xiao Hong.

395
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,940
This drawing is a life.

396
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,940
You can take it.

397
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,940
Jiang Er.

398
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,940
My master is a life.

399
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,940
You are too much.

400
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,940
Enough.

401
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,940
I've got the drawing.

402
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,940
Tell me your plan.

403
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,940
I want to ask Duke Su to help me to Nisha factory.

404
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,940
I'm trapped in the school's rescue department.

405
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
It sounds like

406
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,940
saving lives.

407
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,940
I don't want to be your company.

408
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,940
I've never been fair to you.

409
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,940
I'm the chess piece you have.

410
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,940
You are too much.

411
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,940
From the beginning,

412
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,940
I can't even count a chess piece.

413
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,940
I'll give you a chance.

414
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,940
I'll give you a chance.

415
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,940
I'll give you a chance.

416
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,940
I'll use you to go back to the Jiang family.

417
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,940
You've been watching me.

418
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,940
The beginning was because of the guess.

419
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,940
You were behind me and Li's bet.

420
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
You were behind me.

421
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,940
You didn't want Li's family to be in the ashes.

422
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,940
That's why you hurt me twice.

423
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,940
You helped me to get away from the world.

424
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,940
You've been watching me.

425
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,940
You were watching me if I had the right to be your chess piece.

426
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,940
After I came to Lu Yang,

427
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,940
I fought Li's family to protect the Ye family.

428
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,940
That's why you really started to treat me as your chess piece.

429
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
Right?

430
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,940
Why should I deal with Li's family?

431
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,940
You've been searching for the cause.

432
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,940
You've been searching for the cause.

433
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,940
You've been searching for the cause.

434
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,940
These years, the capital is full of corruption.

435
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,940
People who die are all innocent people.

436
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,940
There must be someone behind them.

437
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,940
Do you know who they are?

438
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,940
I'm not that capable.

439
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,940
But I can see from your eyes.

440
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,940
From the capital to Lu Yang,

441
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,940
your eyes have always been Li's family.

442
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,940
I have to think about what the other people's eyes are.

443
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,940
That's right.

444
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,940
The capital's wealth is broken.

445
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,940
Li Jin came to Lu Yang.

446
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,940
What's Lu Yang?

447
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,940
The Ye family of Fu family.

448
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,940
The wealth is the great opportunity of the country.

449
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,940
The people are not weak.

450
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,940
Duke Su, you're from the south.

451
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
You're the one who killed Li.

452
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,940
You're the one who's being killed.

453
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,940
Jiang Li.

454
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,940
Don't you want to live?

455
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,940
I will.

456
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,940
But I can't live.

457
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,940
As for me,

458
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,940
I can't live without you.

459
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,940
I've already made up my mind

460
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,940
to be your wife.

461
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,940
How do you know I can't be a murderer?

462
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,940
You're so annoying.

463
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,940
I'm giving you my life.

464
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,940
What did you say?

465
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,940
I said

466
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,940
I gave my life to you.

467
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,940
You're still being so polite to me.

468
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,940
I'm sorry, Miss Jiang.

469
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940
I'm not interested in this game anymore.

470
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940
Xiao Heng.

471
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,940
The book is all in vain.

472
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,940
You said it.

473
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,940
The book is all in vain.

474
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,940
All in vain.

475
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,940
It's all in vain.

476
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,940
You said it.

477
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,940
Are you scared?

478
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,940
What am I scared of?

479
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,940
I'm scared of your life on the land.

480
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,940
You scared me.

481
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,940
You saved Ren Yi and Xia Teng Kong Dong on the sand.

482
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,940
You're not going to the East Mountain

483
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,940
when you're sick.

484
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,940
I'm going to go.

485
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,940
How do you want to get out of Feng Yu Hall

486
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,940
before you go to the East Mountain?

487
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,460
The

488
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,940
The

489
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,940
The

490
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,940
The

491
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,940
The

492
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,940
Suddenly, a mother and son

493
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,940
almost identical

494
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
like your daughter,

495
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,940
Ping Kong,

496
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,940
and Duke Su.

497
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,940
When did they

498
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,940
start to have such a big family?

499
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,940
What did they come for?

500
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,940
They didn't come early or late.

501
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,940
The Ministry of Justice

502
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,940
approved your exhibition.

503
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,940
They came here in a hurry.

504
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,940
Did you see it?

505
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,940
Li.

506
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,940
Is there a possibility

507
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,940
that they came here

508
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,940
for you?

509
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,940
Li.

510
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,940
If that's the case,

511
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,940
I'm sorry.

512
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,940
You have to die in advance.

513
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,940
Li.

514
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,940
Li.

515
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,940
Li.

516
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,940
Li.

517
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,940
Xiaoling.

518
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,940
We have their news.

519
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,940
We have a secret path.

520
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,940
We followed them.

521
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,940
The second-ranked man went to Liang's Hall.

522
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,940
Duke Su went to the Black Room.

523
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,940
And someone went to the Nonghu House.

524
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,940
What are they going to do in these places?

525
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,940
They went to buy food.

526
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,940
They went through different channels

527
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,940
to buy food.

528
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,940
Then compared with the price and the price.

529
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,940
Good boy.

530
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,940
He's going to catch my little pervert.

531
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,940
Who's watching Liang Cang now?

532
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,940
Monkey.

533
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
How many people?

534
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
Four.

535
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
Four.

536
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
How many?

537
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,940
Four.

538
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,940
Four.

539
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,940
Four.

540
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,940
Why don't you just open Liang Cang

541
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,940
and see what's going on?

542
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,940
I'm so angry.

543
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,940
The people who are watching Liang Cang are all elite.

544
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,940
There are too many people who are going to follow him.

545
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,940
Maybe I can't catch them.

546
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,940
Bring them back.

547
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,940
Follow me to Liang Cang.

548
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,940
They are not in Liang Cang to do the food.

549
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,940
I'll seal the hall to eat.

550
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
Yes.

551
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,940
Let's go.

552
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,940
Go.

553
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,940
You guys, go this way.

554
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,940
You guys, go this way.

555
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,940
Hurry up.

556
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,940
Go.

557
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,940
Be careful.

558
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,940
Be careful.

559
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
Be careful.

560
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,940
Go.

561
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,940
Hurry up.

562
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,940
Hurry up.

563
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
Hurry up.

564
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
What's wrong?

565
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,940
Only these?

566
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
Where are the others?

567
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,940
Sit down.

568
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,940
Good.

569
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,940
You're playing with me in the East and West, right?

570
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,940
Get up.

571
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,940
Follow me.

572
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,940
Okay.

573
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,940
Don't move.

574
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,940
Don't move.

575
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,940
Don't move.

576
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,940
How did you think of this plan

577
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,940
to teach Liang Cang a lesson?

578
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,940
To protect the people and the people?

579
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,940
To protect the war?

580
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,940
I gave you the responsibility

581
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,940
to take care of Liang Cang.

582
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,940
But you made a mistake.

583
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,940
You're a good man.

584
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,940
You're a government official.

585
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,940
You should take it out.

586
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,940
You don't deserve to be a official.

587
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,940
It's just the Xiaqiao Island.

588
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,940
The people are worried.

589
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,940
I think we should attack Liang Cang.

590
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,940
Or else, the Yutang will be in trouble.

591
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,940
I've made a bet.

592
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,940
I know what to do.

593
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,940
Eight people.

594
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,940
Go and check the sand field.

595
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,940
The people you want to find are not in the sand field.

596
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,940
They're just a fool.

597
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,940
They should be in this mine.

598
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,940
I know.

599
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,940
From the south of this mountain.

600
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,940
There's a wild animal there.

601
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,940
You can go in.

602
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,940
Chief.

603
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,940
I can.

604
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,940
Listen to him.

605
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,940
Let's go.

606
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,940
Go.

607
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,940
It should be here.

608
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,940
Are you sure?

609
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,940
Yes.

610
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,940
The hole is too small.

611
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,940
It's probably because it's not convenient to move.

612
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,940
So it's abandoned.

613
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,940
I'll go check it out.

614
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,940
It's here.

615
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,940
Go that way.

616
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,940
I don't think there's a gap.

617
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
I don't know either.

618
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
Then go ahead.

619
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
You go this way.

620
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,940
I'll go this way.

621
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,940
I think that road is more like the way to the map.

622
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
Go that way.

623
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,940
I'll change it for you.

624
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,940
Let's go.

625
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
Mrs. passththoy.

626
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,940
What now?

627
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,940
Down?

628
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,820
Be careful

629
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
Don't look down

630
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,740
Beware

631
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:11,980
Be careful

632
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,940
Let's go.

633
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,940
The End

634
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,940
So bitter.

635
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,940
What are you doing?

636
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,940
Get some spirit.

637
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,940
What are you afraid of?

638
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,940
It's working under this time.

639
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,940
What's wrong?

640
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,940
You, don't be so cruel.

641
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,940
Let me catch you.

642
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,940
Why are you looking at me?

643
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
What are you looking at?

644
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,940
Who is looking at me?

645
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,940
You asked me to come.

646
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,940
You're so tired.

647
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,940
Give me a punch.

648
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,940
I'll wait for you.

649
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940
I'll punch you.

650
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
You're so coward.

651
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
I'm waiting for you.

652
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,940
You're so good.

653
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,940
Tell me.

654
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,940
What's wrong?

655
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,940
We can't eat.

656
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,940
You scared me again.

657
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,940
I'll punch you.

658
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,940
You're so good.

659
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,940
Fine.

660
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,940
Don't ask me to punch you.

661
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,940
You.

662
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,940
You're so useless.

663
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,940
I'm telling you.

664
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,940
Don't call me useless.

665
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,940
Just go.

666
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,940
Miss.

667
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,940
You're dancing with me.

668
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,940
Dancing?

669
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,940
Miss.

670
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,940
You're so coward.

671
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,940
Don't be afraid.

672
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,940
Take it.

673
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,940
Drink with me.

674
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,940
I'll show you a way.

675
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
Yes.

676
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,940
Miss.

677
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,940
Miss.

678
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,940
You're so coward.

679
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,940
Brother Su.

680
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,940
It's done.

681
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,940
Good job.

682
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,940
No need.

683
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,940
I can do this kind of physical exercise.

684
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,940
Cut the crap.

685
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,940
You.

686
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,940
You're so far away.

687
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,940
Put this on.

688
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,940
Move it faster.

689
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,940
Change.

690
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,940
You look like a blind man.

691
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,940
Compared with your habit,

692
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,940
this game looks more exciting.

693
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,940
You're a blind man.

694
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,940
You shouldn't be a conservative.

695
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,940
Sometimes, it looks like

696
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,940
you should be more cautious.

697
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,940
You're so strong.

698
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,940
Fang Jun.

699
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,940
What's wrong?

700
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,940
The gun and the gun are in the warehouse.

701
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,940
The key is...

702
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,940
found.

703
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,940
I'm sorry.

704
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,940
What should I do?

705
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,940
You should have been more cautious.

706
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,940
What's wrong?

707
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,940
Hurry up.

708
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,940
Do your job properly.

709
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,940
Don't be a fool.

710
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,940
I'm telling you.

711
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,940
Hurry up.

712
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,940
Hurry up.

713
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,940
Hurry up.

714
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,940
Hurry up.

715
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,940
Three years ago, the earthquake in Huai Xiang...

716
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,940
Hurry up.

717
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,940
Someone said that

718
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,940
the mine was not good for the mountain.

719
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,940
The mine was blocked by the court.

720
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,940
But why did it die?

721
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,940
What are you doing?

722
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,940
Get up.

723
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,940
You knew it long ago.

724
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,940
You came to Huai Xiang to investigate this mine.

725
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,940
But this is the mine of the court.

726
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,940
You're being so mean.

727
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,940
The place is closed.

728
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,940
The mine.

729
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,940
The mine.

730
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,940
The snow is falling.

731
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,940
Shen Yurong.

732
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,940
Hurry up.

733
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,940
Princess.

734
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,940
So all of this is related.

735
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,940
So...

736
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,940
Do you know what the consequences of your face?

737
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,940
I'm sorry.

738
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,940
I'm sorry.

739
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,940
I'm sorry.

740
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:31,940
I'm sorry.

741
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,940
I'm sorry.

742
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,940
I'm sorry.

743
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,940
I'm sorry.

744
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,940
I'm sorry.

745
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,940
I'm sorry.

746
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,940
I'm sorry.

747
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,940
I'm sorry.

748
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:39,940
I'm sorry.

749
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,940
I'm sorry.

750
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,940
I'm sorry.

751
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,940
I'm sorry.

752
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,940
I'm sorry.

753
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,940
I'm sorry.

754
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,940
I'm sorry.

755
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:46,940
I'm sorry.

756
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,940
I'm sorry.

757
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,940
I'm sorry.

758
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,940
I'm sorry.

759
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,940
