1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't admit it

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When spring comes, I'll return to my homeland

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 1

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You guessed it right.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Xi Shuran really went to find the Tai Buling.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The former princess has a ghost in her mansion.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The latter went to the Jiang family to get the blood.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Tai Buling?

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now it's not the Tai Buling of the court.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Then let's go.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is the map of the Tai Buling.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I've sent people to get it all.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Master, the Second Miss Jiang is here.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Master, Second Miss Jiang is here.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry to disturb you.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't know that Duke Su is busy with his work.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Please forgive me.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's okay.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's just a little bit of a surprise.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm interested in you.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm here because I have something to ask.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So I don't have to stay.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You have something to ask me again?

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I have power with you.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So I don't have to bother you.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Tell me.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Duke Su wants to get the Tai Buling.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You listen to me.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I came with Duke Su.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I came here because I have no chance to listen to you.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But now it seems that I'm here at the right time.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's because of the time when the Jiang family was executed?

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
My stepmother said something to her father.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
She wanted to ask the Tai Buling to get the blood.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't want to do this.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I can't say anything about the Tai Buling.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I came here to get the blood.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry that I can't control the Tai Buling.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Only the Princess Wanning is alone.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The Tai Buling is in charge of the royal family.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Now it's his turn.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Duke Su, you can't do anything.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Smart.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Duke Su, you promised.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm asking for your request.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Help me find a good man to talk to.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Only this?

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I won't disturb Duke Su.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll leave first.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
A'Li.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What did you just say?

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What?

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You said you had a good relationship with me.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So you didn't take it seriously.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I know I owe Duke Su too much.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm a little nervous.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I need to find a reason to be honest with myself.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I used to think that I owe you the same thing.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Now I can't pay you back.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't pay me back.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Then you're sorry.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll leave first.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The Tai Bu Shu is under the guard.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Get out of the way.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But you're alone.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How can you face the whole Tai Bu Shu?

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's okay.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can lose my temper.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He can lose his temper.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Someone took the bottom of the two ladies.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's great.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's free to be in the military.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm in a good mood.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you ready for tomorrow?

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The 53th guest of the Tai Bu Lin will come.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Actually,

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
you can just put this medicine in your mouth.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You have to keep an eye on Aunt Hu.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Otherwise, she will ruin my business.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Madam,

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I always think that Tai Bu Lin is not a good person.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What if there are some differences at that time?

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What are you worried about?

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're risking your life.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do we have to take this step?

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Jin Dai,

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
how many years have you been with me?

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's been more than 30 years since I started to be born.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I've been here since I was a child.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But it's okay.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Da Xiao,

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
you're the most important person in the family.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You don't listen to your father.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But you're now

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
more like him.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You even think that I've changed.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is that so?

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Madam,

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
you're actually the same as me.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll always protect you.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But I don't want to see you unhappy.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Now,

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm especially fond of that one.

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm so envious.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll always have a smile on my face.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Our family's wife.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm so envious.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
When we get out of the river,

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
everything will be fine.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You must take care.

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll get going now.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sister,

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
the person in the Palace of the State of Su has arrived.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I changed into a robe for him.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He's with Snow White.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Do you remember to watch him.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Follow me today.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't go too far.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Things will get worse today.

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't have time to worry about you.

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll be back soon.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll be back soon.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll be back soon.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm not a good person.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm not free to worry about you.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You can find a safe place.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't worry, sister.

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll take care of myself.

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Come here.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What are your plans for this matter?

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Actually, I'm very familiar with it.

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I just want to live a life that's so tight.

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I didn't want to live a life

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
that's so hard to eat and warm in the Imperial Hall.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What's this?

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Open it.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's over.

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You're willing to stay by my side.

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm the happiest person.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Now you've realized some words.

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If you want to go out and see it someday,

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll make you a house in Lu Yang.

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You can try to be a little sister.

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If you want to marry someone,

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
find a good person to marry.

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If you don't want to marry,

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
you can just do it.

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I can do it.

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Tong'er,

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I've treated you as my own sister.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't say that again.

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Sister.

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Brother.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Greetings, Prime Minister Jiang.

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The things that the Taibuling did were done in the palace.

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Please come to the palace for my little family.

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Prime Minister Jiang is serious.

177
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll give you a chance.

178
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll come to Jiang Jiang for the people I want to marry.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Please.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Prime Minister Jiang, please.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is the wife of Prime Minister Jiang.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes.

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The evil spirits are awake.

184
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The evil spirits are awake.

185
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The immortal spirits are invisible.

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The ancient spirit is immortal.

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's so dangerous.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's so dangerous.

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yao'er,

190
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yao'er,

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yao'er,

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yao'er,

193
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yao'er.

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yao'er.

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yao'er.

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yao'er!

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yao'er!

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yao'er!

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What's wrong with you?

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yao'er!

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The girl is in a bad mood.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
She's very strong.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
She almost got her nerves sucked.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If she can't get out of the circle,

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
she might die.

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Where is she?

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
She was at the door.

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I saw the black flag floating in the sky.

210
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm afraid she's in a bad mood.

211
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I've never been in a bad mood.

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I've been in a bad mood.

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Your Highness,

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
are you feeling bad?

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Your Highness,

216
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
something big happened.

217
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Jia Miao, Jia Miao is on fire.

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
She's burned to death.

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We must get rid of the evil.

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If we wait until the evil is done,

221
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
no one will come to the mansion.

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We'll be in trouble.

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We'll be in trouble.

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We'll be in trouble.

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yao'er,

226
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't be like this.

227
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yao'er,

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yao'er,

229
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yao'er,

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yao'er.

231
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can't do this.

232
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
How can I do this?

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The evil needs to be removed.

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Please take care of everyone in the mansion.

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I need to talk about the method.

236
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I need to talk about the method.

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I need to talk about the method.

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I need to talk about the method.

239
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I need to talk about the method.

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I need to talk about the method.

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
A gentleman whoole,

242
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:33,780
Swallowing

243
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,600
Dancing

244
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,940
The Ace,

245
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,000
please shatter the法!

246
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,440
Water Resonance,

247
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,000
佇使力達硬

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,660
The Throne D'es immersed and burnt,

249
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,600
Full-on power and gentle figure!

250
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,900
Clear and beautiful body!

251
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,600
You plan to kill me?

252
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,400
Clear body?

253
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,560
Hmmph!

254
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,680
I think I changed my strategy.

255
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,460
Keep ψ, I'll just give in.

256
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,560
I think so too.

257
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,060
White-teeth.

258
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,560
I heard there was a bit of threat to this Tao Muzhen.

259
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,740
in this wrong of the Lord's,

260
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,040
but have the blood,

261
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,060
it's a publishing accident.

262
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,540
I can't partake.

263
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,760
ₔ and mu corrupt.

264
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,240
Yellow oar rain,

265
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,500
идеal moisture,

266
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,660
Goddess,

267
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,720
Tao prominent,

268
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,440
Her pilots far-air.

269
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,820
Show up.

270
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,640
My Lord.

271
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,600
What are you doing?

272
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,800
What's the meaning of the Tai Paling?

273
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,680
Prime Minister Jiang,

274
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,480
only the lady in the house

275
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,120
is the leader of the Xie Sui.

276
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,880
This lady has already been under the Xie Sui.

277
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,560
If she doesn't get out in time,

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,520
she won't be able to harm the people.

279
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,720
The whole Jiang family

280
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,000
will be in danger from now on.

281
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,600
Nonsense.

282
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,120
How could our lady have the Xie Sui?

283
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,520
You're a bloody liar.

284
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,720
What are you talking about?

285
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,520
How could Jiang Li have the Xie Sui?

286
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,160
Li is very gentle and gentle.

287
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,680
She doesn't look like the Xie Sui.

288
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,800
Is there any misunderstanding?

289
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,480
Prime Minister Jiang,

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,080
did you see it wrong?

291
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,400
Jiang Li can't have the Xie Sui.

292
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,880
Yes, Prime Minister Jiang.

293
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,760
Li was in the Zhengyu Hall in Qingcheng Mountain.

294
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
For ten years,

295
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
the Zhengyu Hall is a pure place.

296
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,640
How could there be any evil things?

297
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,920
You're right.

298
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,560
The mountain is high and the grass is deep.

299
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,320
It's the most suitable place.

300
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,720
The Xie Sui is the only one who can capture the evil.

301
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,200
It's the only one who can capture the evil.

302
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,600
Since this lady

303
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
has been living in the Zhengyu Hall,

304
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,440
the Xie Sui is the only one who can capture the evil.

305
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
After she comes back,

306
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,400
she will be clear-minded.

307
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm afraid that the source of this is there.

308
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,040
Qingcheng Mountain.

309
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,680
You've said all the good things.

310
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,520
Why should we believe you?

311
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,840
You've said it.

312
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,120
We can't believe it.

313
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,160
Be polite.

314
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,200
It's true.

315
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,440
I'm sorry, Prime Minister.

316
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,920
We don't understand.

317
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,520
But Li is the little girl who knows the truth.

318
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,640
Please understand it.

319
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,440
And then you can decide.

320
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,360
The person who is captured by the Xie Sui

321
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,640
is usually in a bad mood.

322
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,240
Please ask this lady

323
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,760
if she is in a bad mood after she comes back.

324
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,040
She is different from before.

325
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,240
Isn't that so?

326
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,160
After the second lady comes back,

327
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,800
her personality and temperament

328
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
are completely different from before.

329
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,160
It's like she is a coward.

330
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,720
It's really true.

331
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,880
I'm just sorry that I've lived in the Zhengyu Hall

332
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,800
for ten years.

333
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,200
It's not easy to get married and go back to Jiang's family.

334
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,640
But it's a cruel and cruel thing to do.

335
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,920
Even the father of the second lady

336
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,000
Zhong Shulin

337
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,920
is probably confused.

338
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,240
You're right.

339
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
I'm not sure

340
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,760
that the change in the world

341
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,200
will happen in a short period of time.

342
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,360
But if I go to Zhengyu Hall

343
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,440
not for one or two days,

344
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,080
not for a month or two,

345
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
it's ten years.

346
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
It's not possible to hold it for ten years.

347
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
I said that I didn't see Li Yang

348
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,920
in Zhengyu Hall before.

349
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,520
Now Li Yang is still in the Zhengyu Hall.

350
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,880
She's been in a low state for a day and a night.

351
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
This is the common attitude of Zhengyu Hall.

352
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,360
She can't eat and sleep well.

353
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,200
She can't wear warm clothes.

354
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,560
She can't even play and beg for forgiveness.

355
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,360
She's so poor and ungrateful.

356
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Even the daughter of the most noble and gentle

357
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,240
and the child of the innocent in the heaven

358
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,120
is not the same as before.

359
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,920
As for the habit I just mentioned,

360
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,360
Father,

361
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,760
Li Yang has always liked eating wedding stars.

362
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,200
She likes soft blankets.

363
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,240
Even the cloth on her clothes

364
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,280
is also very hard to wear.

365
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,120
But Li Yang has been in Zhengyu Hall for so many years.

366
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,440
cheated from the Rockefeller Foundation

367
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,800
who runs a business with Xinx mistaken admitting to check inform dogs

368
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,240
that Ozun is not your brother.

369
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,240
Li Yang paid out automatically

370
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,440
chip off to PI put on special hot wenomen.

371
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,400
No wonder Zhu Feng's heart was broken.

372
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,440
isn't expected to be broken.

373
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,960
and it's only for the survival of it.

374
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,480
Wind요.

375
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,360
See that?

376
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,000
where this universe is?

377
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,640
There's no queasy that I'm talking about.

378
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,200
How do you guys know

379
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,760
and guess that queasy in only be jeweler.

380
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,240
However, we have inform Zhibin

381
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,280
that the day will come

382
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
when someone enters Zhibin

383
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,400
and the person leaves theور

384
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,760
once you have a sleep,

385
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,240
you will practice and

386
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,720
braver than a diamond

387
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,200
to continue through the dayconscious

388
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,600
and rounds off inside the body.

389
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,360
You wouldn't be in the face one day,

390
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,240
but before you brake,

391
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,280
you'll be more powerful.

392
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,640
You can then

393
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,480
adjust the hosttte,

394
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,440
bringing yourself for it.

395
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,080
And RoyalНing,

396
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,120
you have to make as many as you can.

397
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,120
Besides, when you have a excited energy,

398
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,560
you'll be very strong.

399
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,800
I'm afraid

400
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,040
was the cultivation of Xie Sui.

401
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,800
Also,

402
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,960
Jiang'er's wife

403
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,120
was shot by the Xie County Magistrate.

404
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,080
And Rongwang

405
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,960
was more like the daughter of Xie County Magistrate,

406
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,840
Consort Xue.

407
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,320
I'm afraid the previous chief of Xie Sui

408
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,400
is Consort Xue who died.

409
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,680
So I said

410
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,680
the original story

411
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,360
is on the Qingcheng Mountain.

412
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,280
You all

413
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,640
go ahead.

414
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,240
Yes.

415
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,040
Consort Xue.

416
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,960
Before Li'er

417
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,800
went to the mountain.

418
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,080
To inform the Xie County Magistrate

419
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,240
about the case of Xie Huaiyuan,

420
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,440
he didn't send her back to Huaiyuan.

421
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,840
He hasn't taken the medicine

422
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,440
and is very concerned.

423
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,760
But before that,

424
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,960
Li'er and Xie Huaiyuan

425
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,560
didn't have any relationship.

426
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,760
Why do they care so much about the outsiders?

427
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,000
Is it really

428
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,680
that you have met Consort Xue

429
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,320
before,

430
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,840
and met her?

431
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,920
Yes.

432
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,160
I was able to live

433
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,360
with Consort Xue.

434
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,040
I have a grudge against her.

435
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,200
That's right.

436
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,040
Xie Sui

437
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,720
was originally

438
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
a criminal.

439
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,920
After Consort Xue died,

440
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,800
she was also a criminal.

441
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,320
This Xie Sui was a villain.

442
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,520
He was a cruel man.

443
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,000
If he didn't get rid of her,

444
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,040
he would be in trouble.

445
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,640
Yes.

446
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Father!

447
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,600
Mother!

448
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,400
Father!

449
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,920
Father!

450
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Mother!

451
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yao'er!

452
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Ge Yao'er!

453
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,840
Mother!

454
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,960
My daughter!

455
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,520
My Yao'er!

456
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,320
Taibulin,

457
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,120
how are you going to punish

458
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,840
the evil spirit on my daughter?

459
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
It's not just a simple punishment.

460
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,400
It's not easy to suppress evil spirit.

461
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,480
You also need to bring

462
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,920
the second daughter to the temple

463
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,320
and study the law.

464
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,720
You can't be too far away.

465
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,280
You can't be too far away.

466
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,360
Father!

467
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,920
Mother!

468
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Mother!

469
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Father!

470
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Mother!

471
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,680
Mother!

472
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,280
Prime Minister Jiang,

473
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,360
you need to make a decision as soon as possible.

474
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,560
If you wait until Xie Sui

475
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,160
is completely defeated,

476
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,560
it won't be too late.

477
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,960
Yes!

478
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,800
Brother!

479
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,080
Do you really believe

480
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,520
that there is Xie Sui on her body?

481
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,320
Uncle!

482
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,760
Please don't believe others' lies.

483
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,440
If you leave the Zhengyu Hall,

484
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,840
you will be punished.

485
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,880
If you let her be punished again,

486
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,360
she will be killed.

487
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,160
Yes!

488
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,840
Lord Chu,

489
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,200
I am wronged.

490
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,080
We can't use Xie Sui

491
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,880
in the house.

492
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,800
Brother,

493
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,280
please make a decision.

494
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,880
Yes, brother.

495
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,040
Please make a decision.

496
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,720
You can't let Jiang Jia

497
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,680
destroy us like this.

498
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,080
We can't be in peace.

499
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,920
Yes, brother.

500
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,160
What are you talking about?

501
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,600
How can you say that?

502
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,560
How can you say that?

503
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,440
Enough!

504
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,440
Don't fight!

505
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
I'm really scared.

506
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,000
Think about it.

507
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,080
Thanks.

508
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,240
I'll just put a go to you.

509
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,040
Thanks.

510
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,160
OK.

511
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,120
Master.

512
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
You and your family

513
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,140
have always been

514
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,220
at odds here.

515
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,640
We live in a stable state.

516
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,660
You are born here.

517
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,600
But you aren't rich.

518
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,480
Master!

519
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,640
Uncle Wang.

520
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,800
I deserve one.

521
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,520
We are a family.

522
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,980
Yao Er.

523
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,840
Yao Er, my Yao Er.

524
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,320
My good man.

525
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,060
Yao Er.

526
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,300
Mom.

527
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,560
Yao Er.

528
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,520
Yao Er.

529
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,480
Yao Er.

530
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,480
Yao Er.

531
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,120
What should I do?

532
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,020
That's enough.

533
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,760
Xiao Ling.

534
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,100
Scientists.

535
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,840
Li Er.

536
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,640
There's fish.

537
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,080
Xiaoling.

538
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,920
Xiaoling.

539
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,880
Xiaoling, don't scare me.

540
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,360
Are you okay?

541
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:30,920
Xiaoling.

542
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,680
Xiaoling.

543
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,040
Xiaoling.

544
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,320
Yang.

545
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,280
Li.

546
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,280
It's okay, Yang.

547
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,320
Are we okay?

548
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,480
Yes.

549
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,000
Don't talk to me.

550
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,920
Don't say that.

551
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,320
Take him away.

552
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,320
Take him away.

553
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,000
Daddy.

554
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,480
Daddy, save Yue'er.

555
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,800
Daddy, save me.

556
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,160
Let go of my Yue'er.

557
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,520
Let go of my Yue'er.

558
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,360
Let go of my Yue'er.

559
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,000
Daddy.

560
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,760
My Yue'er.

561
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,680
Mother Wu,

562
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,280
why is she here?

563
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,800
Yue'er.

564
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,600
My Yue'er.

565
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,640
Master.

566
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,680
Master.

567
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,880
Don't you remember?

568
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,280
This is Yue'er's voice.

569
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,320
It's Yue'er's voice.

570
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,920
Yue'er.

571
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:38,680
Go.

572
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,360
Call her.

573
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,240
Take her away.

574
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,560
Yes.

575
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:40,960
Yue'er.

576
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,600
Come here.

577
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Mother Wu, come with me.

578
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,600
No.

579
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,320
Don't talk nonsense.

580
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,080
Take her away.

581
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,040
Don't talk nonsense.

582
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,200
Let go of me.

583
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,560
Daddy.

584
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,680
Yue'er.

585
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,400
That's our Yue'er.

586
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,960
Daddy.

587
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,920
Daddy, save Yue'er.

588
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,640
My Yue'er.

589
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,720
Stop it.

590
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,160
Stop it.

591
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,560
Let go of me.

592
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
This is about my grandson Jiang Yue.

593
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,400
Before we know it,

594
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
no one can leave.

595
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,000
Madam,

596
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,720
this crazy woman is making a fool of us.

597
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,760
Think about it.

598
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,520
Take her away.

599
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,040
Yes.

600
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,720
Madam.

601
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,160
I'm not crazy.

602
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,400
How could I

603
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,560
not recognize my own daughter?

604
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,240
Daddy.

605
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,800
Madam.

606
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,400
She's really Yue'er.

607
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,240
Daddy, save Yue'er.

608
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,840
Master.

609
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,760
Daddy.

610
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,280
I'm calling you daddy.

611
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,800
Daddy.

612
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,520
I'm calling you daddy.

613
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,440
Daddy, save Yue'er.

614
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,600
Daddy.

615
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,160
Yue'er.

616
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,200
Husband.

617
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,160
Madam Hu is really sick this time.

618
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,240
They're not sick.

619
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,280
This is Yue'er's voice.

620
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,840
It's our Yue'er.

621
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,160
Yue'er.

622
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,800
Yue'er.

623
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,720
Yue'er.

624
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,560
Yue'er.

625
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,880
Yue'er.

626
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,600
I'm sorry.

627
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,960
Yue'er, it hurts.

628
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,920
Where to tell me, daddy.

629
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,720
My head hurts.

630
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,320
Yue'er.

631
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,840
My head hurts.

632
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,480
It's fine now.

633
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:57,840
It's fine now.

634
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,360
My head hurts.

635
00:26:59,360 --> 00:26:59,880
Husband.

636
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,840
It's fine.

637
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,560
Yue'er.

638
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,680
Yue'er.

639
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,360
I'm not going to

640
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,520
let my sister down any more.

641
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680
Please don't push me.

642
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,920
My head hurts.

643
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,840
My head is burning.

644
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,560
Don't threaten me.

645
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,320
Don't be afraid.

646
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,040
Don't be afraid.

647
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,480
Don't be afraid.

648
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,280
Don't kill me!

649
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
You're a tiger!

650
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,480
Jiang Lin,

651
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
you're obviously a new method

652
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,280
of breaking the law of the people.

653
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,680
You killed Yue'er.

654
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,680
You killed Yue'er.

655
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,480
Don't kill Yue'er.

656
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,880
You killed my brother.

657
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,880
My brother is eight years old.

658
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Why did you kill him?

659
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,080
Don't kill my wife.

660
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,680
Why?

661
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Why?

662
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
Don't kill my wife.

663
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,080
Let go of me.

664
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
Let go of me.

665
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Why?

666
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
Let go of me.

667
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,280
Father,

668
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
it's me.

669
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,480
The Tai Bu Lin is really powerful.

670
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
It's clear

671
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
that it really has some feelings.

672
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Father,

673
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,880
I saw a little girl.

674
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
She said she was Jiang Yue.

675
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,880
She begged me to apologize to her mother.

676
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
I'm sorry.

677
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
I'm sorry.

678
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
I'm sorry.

679
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
What's going on?

680
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
I saw once,

681
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Jiang Yue played with Ruo Yao.

682
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
She was only because of Ruo Yao's crying.

683
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
Mother was angry with Jiang Yue.

684
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,480
She pushed her out of the car.

685
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Poor Jiang Yue

686
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
died on the mountain of Jia.

687
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
But she was shot by someone.

688
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
She died because of the falling of the mountain of Jia.

689
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
Jin Xiu Ran,

690
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,480
you're so cruel.

691
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
Poor my Yue.

692
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
You're so cruel.

693
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,480
My Yue.

694
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
My Yue.

695
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
I said let go of me.

696
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Jiang Yue was taken to the body by the evil spirit.

697
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
The Tai Bu Lin is your son.

698
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
You're the one who killed him.

699
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
You're the one who killed him.

700
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
Tai Bu Lin.

701
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,100
Are you all the

702
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
evil spirit?

703
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,100
They said Jiang Li killed his mother.

704
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
I killed him.

705
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
The child who killed him

706
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
was yours.

707
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
I was pregnant.

708
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
But he insisted on taking me to the attic.

709
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
He made me fall down and lose the child.

710
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
If it wasn't for him,

711
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,480
I would have been the son of the devil.

712
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,480
I wouldn't have been so miserable.

713
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
I've been thinking about taking revenge for my child.

714
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
Don't you want to?

715
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Can you

716
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,480
help me get rid of Jiang Li now?

717
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
If you think that I'm being taken by the evil spirit,

718
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
you must get rid of him immediately.

719
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Brother Jian.

720
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Tai Bu Lin.

721
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Tai Bu Lin killed him.

722
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Go.

723
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
He's here.

724
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
No.

725
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Take him away.

726
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
No.

727
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Take him back to the house.

728
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Jiang Li, hurry up.

729
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Don't kill him.

730
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
Jiang Li, don't kill him.

731
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Run.

732
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Run.

733
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
Wait for me.

734
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
What are you doing?

735
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Go, Jiang Li.

736
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Jiang Li.

737
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
Go.

738
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
What are you doing?

739
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Don't come over.

740
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
Don't come over.

741
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
If you dare to come over,

742
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
I'll kill him.

743
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Go.

744
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
Tai Bu Lin.

745
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Don't hurt the woman.

746
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
Don't hurt the woman.

747
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
Don't hurt the woman.

748
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Li Wen Zai.

749
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Good.

750
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Before I die,

751
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
the person I see the most

752
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
is you.

753
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Good.

754
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
You still owe me.

755
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
You owe me a life.

756
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
If you die,

757
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
I'll kill you.

758
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
I'm sorry.

759
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
Bai Zi.

760
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
I'm sorry.

761
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
The world is still the same.

762
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
I haven't finished

763
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
the books.

764
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Let me go.

765
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
Sister.

766
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
I'm sorry.

767
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
I can't

768
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
make it to the end.

769
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
Sister.

770
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
I'm sorry.

771
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
I can't

772
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
make it to the end.

773
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
Sister.

774
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
There is a son.

775
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
It's his son.

776
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,480
It's the happiest time of my life.

777
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,480
I still have one more thing to do.

778
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Sister, please be happy.

779
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,480
Finally, you have to find my wife.

780
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Sister, please be happy.

781
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,480
You must hide me by my wife.

782
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Sister, please be happy.

783
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
Sister, please be happy.

784
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Sister, please be happy.

785
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Sister, you look so beautiful.

786
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,480
Sister, you look so beautiful when you smile.

787
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Sister, don't cry.

788
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
Tuan'er, don't cry.

789
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Don't cry.

790
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
Don't cry.

791
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,480
Don't cry.

792
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
Don't cry.

793
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
Don't cry.

794
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Don't cry.

795
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Don't cry.

796
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
Don't cry.

797
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
Don't cry.

798
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
Tuan'er.

799
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,480
Tuan'er.

800
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
Tuan'er.

801
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
Don't take her away.

802
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Tuan'er.

803
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
Don't cry.

804
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,880
I can't live.

805
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,840
You can't live!

806
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,600
Huiye!

807
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,560
Huiye!

808
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,720
Showtime.

809
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,560
Huiye.

810
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,640
Sangly!

811
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,360
η

812
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,940
You can't live.

813
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,140
Do not stand face up now.

814
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,420
Sangly!

815
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,240
치ange啦

816
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,800
I will be a good girl.

817
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,440
I will be a good girl.

818
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,040
Li'er, let her go!

819
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,840
Go, go, go, steal the food!

820
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,840
Let go of me!

821
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,640
No!

822
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,840
Let go of me!

823
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,840
Let go of me!

824
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,640
Li'er!

825
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,040
Who is she?

826
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,240
My lord!

827
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,640
There is only you.

828
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,040
I want to be with you.

829
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,040
I want to be with you.

830
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,240
There is only you.

831
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,240
I want to be with you.

832
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:04,240
I want to be with you.

833
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,440
Let's go to see the new cloth with my lady.

834
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,440
Yes, let's dress her up.

835
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,440
Yu'er finally got the blood of Chenyuan.

836
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,440
I can safely meet her.

837
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,440
There is something hidden in my heart.

838
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,240
There is something hidden in my heart for many years.

839
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,640
I was really killed by the sorcerers.

840
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,640
It was because she wanted to marry into the Jiang family.

841
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,240
The Tai Bu Shu has a bad way of growing up.

842
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,640
It's different from the inner court.

843
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,040
But it's in the hands of people who are evil and evil.

844
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,440
I've been suffering for many years.

845
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,640
I can clear the case now.

846
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,840
Wan Ning didn't even get the money.

847
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,840
A second wife of Jiang

848
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,440
killed all her wives.

849
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,440
It seems that we have been under pressure this time.

850
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,440
Ok.

851
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,240
Xue Feng is in wait for me.

852
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,560
I will have to be waiting for good things.

853
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,040
I'm not sure if I can do it.

854
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

855
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

856
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

857
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

858
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

859
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

860
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

861
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

862
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

863
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

864
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

865
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

866
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

867
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
Two words of ice and waves.

868
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,040
The endless melody.

869
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,040
Hold your hand.

870
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:53,040
Can you pass through the snow?

871
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,040
In the cold wind.

872
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,040
In the long night.

873
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:07,040
The warmth that is left behind.

874
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,040
Love is deep.

875
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,040
Unable to see you.

876
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:23,040
Can you bury the traces of yesterday?

877
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,040
Love is a game.

878
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:31,040
Use your life to cherish.

879
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:39,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

880
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,040
No matter what you do.

881
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,040
I believe in you.

882
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,040
The moon is trapped in the cold.

883
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

884
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,040
I'm just a little bit worried.

885
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,040
Love is deep.

886
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:09,040
Unable to see you.

887
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,040
Can you pass through the snow?

888
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,040
In the cold wind.

889
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,040
In the long night.

890
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,040
The warmth that is left behind.

891
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,040
Love is deep.

892
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,040
Unable to see you.

893
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,040
Can you bury the traces of yesterday?

894
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,040
Love is deep.

895
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,040
Unable to see you.

896
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,040
Can you bury the traces of yesterday?

897
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,040
Love is deep.
