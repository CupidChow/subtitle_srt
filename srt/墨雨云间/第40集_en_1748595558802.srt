1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad things

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't admit it

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,220
I wait until the spring color wasilen

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Earthsh lar, gold panther

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,360
All crime is set upon death.

15
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,040
Life is one who lose.

16
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,880
Once you are victimized,

17
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,100
Xiao Heng.

18
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,640
ajeep!

19
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,540
Who said that she was cheered?

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,480
How could this man think of such a person?

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,280
Can you Madrid and mie relationship not be introduced to each other?

22
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,040
We喜歡 each other

23
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,900
when we are together.

24
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Don't live inside.

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,600
It's not our choice.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,640
Any kind of revenge

27
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,520
must prove beautiful someone can take ride on our luggage.

28
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
I will come to you.

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,920
I have been a good man for my whole life.

30
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
I have no regrets.

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Today, I will die for Dayan.

32
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,520
I, Xue Fangfei, will never regret it.

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,520
Shen Yurong, if I allow you to kill me again,

34
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,520
I will not be able to do anything.

35
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,520
I will allow you to kill me again.

36
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Ah Li, I once wanted to be a traitor for Dayan.

37
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,520
But the royal family thought of you and me as a horse.

38
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,520
Does anyone remember what I did for Shen Yurong?

39
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
No!

40
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,520
So what's the point of you and me dying for Dayan?

41
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
No one will remember!

42
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Ah Li, if you kill Xiao Heng,

43
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,520
we will live well and live like before.

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Shen Yurong, you are wrong.

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Someone remembers.

46
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,520
The north is a long city.

47
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
The king of the city is back.

48
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,520
The people are not well.

49
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,520
The mountain valley has 100 Dragon-Mount Army.

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,520
To protect the people,

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
we will fight for the dead.

52
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,520
We will not regret it.

53
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,520
We will remember the name of the soldiers.

54
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,520
The 100 Dragon-Mount Eagle in the city.

55
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Xiao Minghan.

56
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
General Xiao.

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Peng Guang.

58
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Peng Fujiu.

59
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Zhao Decheng.

60
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,520
My brother.

61
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
The emperor.

62
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Zhang Che.

63
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Li Licheng.

64
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Xian Ziming.

65
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Dayan Zhongkun.

66
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Xiao Heng.

67
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Consort Xue.

68
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Don't say it!

69
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Sword-sharing.

70
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Shen Yurong.

71
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,520
Today, I will show you the army of our army.

72
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,520
Yang Qing, prepare to fight.

73
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Yang Qing!

74
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Yu Fu is here.

75
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
The enemy is dead.

76
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,520
Dragon-Mount Army, follow me.

77
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Thanks.

78
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Emperor Su.

79
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
Ashes,strings, governor!

80
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Guards from the dragon-mount army.

81
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
We badly襟est them.

82
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Xiao Heng.

83
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,520
You'll really give up this army?

84
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,200
You have your father's soldiers.

85
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,120
The army of the Zhao army

86
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,960
is your ally.

87
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,360
Do you really want your ally

88
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,320
to kill you and Long Wu?

89
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,440
Xiao Heng, you are arrogant.

90
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,080
You have no war.

91
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,840
No one can protect you.

92
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,360
Why are you comparing me with them?

93
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,680
Long Wurixians are dead.

94
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,360
Long Wu Xiejiang.

95
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,800
Li.

96
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:23,340

98
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,340
Ding Qin is a good man.

99
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,340
I count to three.

100
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,340
Follow me.

101
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,340
Let me see your finger.

Remember, don't hesitate.

103
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,340
One, two, three.

104
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,340
Xiao Hong, hold on.

105
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,340
I will kill you.

106
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,340
How did you know

107
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,340
the name of these people?

108
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,340
General Xiao told me.

109
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,340
Xiao Hong, can you let go?

Leave it to me.

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
I'll wait for you to come back.

127
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,280

Don't ever...

135
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,900
It's not aiens beside whom either.

136
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,580
Feel anger in my heart.

137
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,420
Brother Yan,

138
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,980
don't you dare kill me!

139
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,260
You still love me.

140
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,460
Between you and me,

141
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,300
I have no love.

142
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,940
And I don't hate you.

143
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,140
I just want to see

144
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,500
the light in the sky

145
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,940
and the sign of retribution.

146
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,900
You want to see my retribution?

147
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,860
You should have killed me.

148
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,980
You should have killed me.

149
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,460
You owed me.

150
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,260
But I can give you back

151
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,540
and die in your hands.

152
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,820
I'm so sorry.

153
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,380
I'll kill you

154
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,020
and dirty my hands.

155
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,780
You're the traitor of Dayan.

156
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,140
Your retribution

157
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,140
should be given by Dayan.

158
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,860
Li,

159
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,340
if I didn't

160
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,860
get into the Zhao Garden,

161
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,740
I would have

162
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,180
had a good life with you.

163
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,740
We don't need to

164
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,740
do this.

165
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,020
I'll be Shen Yuerong

166
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,220
for my whole life.

167
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,660
At least for a step,

168
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,660
I'll never

169
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,740
be able to return to the Zhao Garden.

170
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,540
Shen Yuerong,

171
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,760
I believe

172
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,500
you'd be more fortunate

173
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,100
that you got married

174
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,620
and got opportunity to live with your father.

175
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,860
Be a pure and nice woman.

176
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,620
Where are you?

177
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:05,780
Mom.

178
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:15,640
After I marshmHD it will not be near

179
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,780
The Long Ballad

180
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,780
Episode 19

181
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,780
Zhao Ye!

182
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,780
What kind of emperor are you hiding in there?

183
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,780
You don't deserve to be that dragon-died man!

184
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,780
Go to the throne and I'll keep you alive!

185
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,780
Your Highness!

186
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,780
The Lu Army has come to kill you!

187
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,780
The Red Fire Army?

188
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,780
Shen Yu Rong, you bastard!

189
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,780
Go!

190
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
Just let it go!

191
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Xian Zhi, you're better than your father.

192
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,780
You even dare to mention General Xiao.

193
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,780
I'm going to avenge General Xiao today

194
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,780
and the 100-dragon army, who died in the battle.

195
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,780
Yes!

196
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,780
Since you all know that,

197
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,780
you should know that he's here for me!

198
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,780
You're going to cover up the crime of your people

199
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,780
and frame my father for the sake of the rest of the people

200
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,780
and seal his way back to the city?

201
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,780
You're going to kill the 100-dragon army.

202
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,780
How can you be so worthy of the Long Ballad?

203
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,780
Yang Xing!

204
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,780
Yes!

205
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,780
Take the criminal down!

206
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,780
Wait!

207
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,780
Bring him up!

208
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,780
If you dare to step up again,

209
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,780
I'll kill him!

210
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,780
This is Zhao Ye's favorite concubine.

211
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,780
Who dares to do that?

212
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,780
Xiao Heng, tell Zhao Ye that

213
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,780
next year, I'll make sure he's on the ground.

214
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,780
Please, State of Su,

215
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,780
don't tell His Majesty about the palace maid.

216
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,780
I'm going to take this secret away.

217
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,780
Your Majesty.

218
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,780
Xiao Heng.

219
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,780
You can't kill me.

220
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,780
I'm your father's disciple.

221
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,780
I'm his only disciple.

222
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,780
I'm not your father.

223
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,780
I have this sword.

224
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,780
I'm not your father!

225
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,780
Your Majesty.

226
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,780
King of Cheng, Zhao Sheng, colluded with Princess Wanning.

227
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,780
She was so loyal to the country that she was so talented.

228
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,780
She was greedy and greedy.

229
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,780
She was so guilty.

230
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,780
After King of Cheng died,

231
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,780
the yunye in Beijing

232
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,780
had already been attacked by King of Cheng.

233
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,780
He was on the move to Beijing.

234
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,780
Ye Shijie wrote the news of King of Cheng and Princess.

235
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,780
The court has officially launched a military campaign

236
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,780
to suppress the rebels.

237
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,780
The army of Beijing was suppressed.

238
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,780
Li Zhongnan's family was arrested because of the traitor.

239
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,780
They were asked about it.

240
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,780
Shen Yurong was exiled.

241
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,780
Even the late Shen and Shen Ruyun

242
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,780
were arrested.

243
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,780
The three of them were expelled from Jiang's clan.

244
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,780
Mother!

245
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,780
Don't let us go!

246
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,780
Mother!

247
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,780
General Xiao was injured and was in a state of emergency.

248
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,780
He was just having a drink of tea and water.

249
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,780
The capital is finally in a peaceful state.

250
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,780
I heard that

251
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,780
he left a message before he died.

252
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,780
He said

253
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,780
don't let me tell you about the palace maid.

254
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,780
Your Majesty,

255
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,780
the Dragon King is ready.

256
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,780
When will you set off?

257
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,780
The day after tomorrow.

258
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,780
Bring all the soldiers who were in charge of the city.

259
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,780
Bring all of them.

260
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,780
Bring all of my soldiers.

261
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,780
King of Cheng is dead.

262
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,780
The country will be in a peaceful state.

263
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,780
You only bring the Dragon King.

264
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,780
I'm not worried.

265
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,780
King of Cheng is still alive.

266
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,780
I can't take the soldiers of the Great Yan.

267
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,780
Besides,

268
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,780
my father brought the Dragon King.

269
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,780
I can keep the Great Yan safe.

270
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,780
I can't lose him.

271
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,780
Father.

272
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,780
Dear!

273
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,780
Good news!

274
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,780
The bloodline has been completely remembered!

275
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,780
You mean...

276
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,780
He is totally awake now.

277
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,780
He remembers all of us.

278
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,220
Take a look.

279
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,780
The Dragon King is already inside.

280
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,220
You glad you fell asleep?

281
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,540
What is the problem?

282
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,640
Please hit me.

283
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,420
Why did her pull you over?

284
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,420
I'm not filial.

285
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,020
I let my father,

286
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:30,980
Zhao,

287
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,980
get the torture,

288
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,740
and the prison.

289
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,660
It's all my fault.

290
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,420
I...

291
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,820
I'm sorry.

292
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,820
I'm sorry.

293
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,020
No.

294
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,260
I'm sorry.

295
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:47,860
It's not your fault.

296
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,580
Get up.

297
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,260
Get up.

298
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,020
It's not Li.

299
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,940
It's not Li.

300
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,620
You've been through so much.

301
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,860
I found out

302
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,140
Li is no longer the one I remember.

303
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,420
She's the one who bullied him.

304
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,140
Even if she gets more mad,

305
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,140
you can still bear it.

306
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,140
Now that I wake up,

307
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,300
I won't let you suffer.

308
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,500
You...

309
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,460
When will we be together?

310
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,820
Father.

311
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,580
We can't go back to Huaixiang now.

312
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,740
Because I'm still the second wife of the Jiang family.

313
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,780
I haven't explained it clearly.

314
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,260
Father, you don't believe me?

315
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,860
I have my brother-in-law now.

316
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,620
How could he leave with us?

317
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,780
Zhao.

318
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,660
Alright.

319
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,500
When we went to the palace,

320
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,660
I heard that...

321
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,820
Father.

322
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,180
You have good taste.

323
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,380
You're a good boy.

324
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,820
No matter what you do,

325
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,380
I'll support you.

326
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,940
Don't be afraid of falling over.

327
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,500
And don't do this.

328
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,380
You can't do anything.

329
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,620
You have to forget about that pit.

330
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,660
Keep going forward.

331
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,220
No matter what,

332
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,820
I'll be with you.

333
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,140
Alright.

334
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,980
Has Uncle Xue's body been recovered?

335
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,940
He's praising you.

336
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,140
What?

337
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,460
He said...

338
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,700
You can ask him yourself.

339
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,900
What about you?

340
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,820
What are you going to do?

341
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,260
Duke Su.

342
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,580
You're a little broken in your mansion.

343
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,220
You should be worried.

344
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,300
Why do you say that?

345
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,220
Think about it.

346
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,500
What do you mean?

347
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,460
I have a new lover.

348
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,500
My girlfriend?

349
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,940
She's the one I've met.

350
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,940
She is?

351
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,300
My perpetrator.

352
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,420
She is?

353
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,220
Is he stupid?

354
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,220
It's possible to think of something.

355
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,220
You said he was a bit...

356
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,220
You're the ones who are stupid!

357
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,220
Let me tell you something.

358
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,220
I'm a troublemaker.

359
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,220
You've already seen it.

360
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,220
Why are you a troublemaker?

361
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,220
Because I want to be a troublemaker.

362
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,220
That's why I'm a troublemaker.

363
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
I...

364
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,220
You should still like this place the most.

365
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,220
I...

366
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,220
Sister.

367
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,220
Li'er.

368
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,220
Sister.

369
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,220
Thank you.

370
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,220
You've washed my life.

371
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,220
Now it's all clean and clean.

372
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
Li'er.

373
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,220
I will do what I promise you.

374
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,220
I will tell you.

375
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:03,220
I wish to go home with him.

376
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,220
I'm so happy.

377
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,220
It's so beautiful.

378
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,220
I'm so happy.

379
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,220
I'm so happy.

380
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
I'm so happy.

381
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm so happy.

382
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
I'm so happy.

383
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,220
I'm so happy.

384
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,220
I'm so happy.

385
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,220
I'm so happy.

386
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,220
I've resigned from the emperor today.

387
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,220
I plan to leave the capital and go to Yongzhou the day after tomorrow.

388
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,220
What do you plan to do?

389
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,220
I've married Xiao Heng.

390
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,220
I will wait for him to come back in the Duke's Manor.

391
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,220
What if he doesn't come back?

392
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,220
I will wait for him to come back.

393
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,220
I will wait for him to come back.

394
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,220
What if he doesn't come back?

395
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,220
If he doesn't come back,

396
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,220
I will do my best to keep him in my life.

397
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,220
But he promised to come back.

398
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,220
Then do as you wish.

399
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,220
Father.

400
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,220
There is one more thing I want to tell you.

401
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:44,220
Do you want to say that you are not Jiang Li.

402
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,220
You are Xu Xiao Heng.

403
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,220
You are Xu Xiao Heng.

404
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,220
You are Xu Xiao Heng.

405
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,220
You are Xu Xiao Heng.

406
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:17,220
Have you ever been hurt when Li'er left?

407
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:25,220
Did anyone accompany him?

408
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,220
Li'er.

409
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,220
When he left,

410
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:39,220
Tong'er and I were all by his side.

411
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,220
Li'er was very safe.

412
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,220
He didn't suffer from pain.

413
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,220
He didn't suffer from the pain of illness.

414
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:56,220
I think he and Mrs. Ye have been reunited.

415
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,220
This matter,

416
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:05,220
I hope only you and I know.

417
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,220
Don't tell anyone else.

418
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,220
You are so old.

419
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,220
You can't bear it.

420
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
I know.

421
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,220
Father.

422
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,220
It's okay.

423
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,220
It's okay.

424
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,220
Li'er.

425
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
I don't know when the Duke of Su will come back.

426
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,220
You really don't want to go to Yongzhou with us?

427
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,220
You have thought it through.

428
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,220
Go with us.

429
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,220
Why do you stay in the capital?

430
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,220
And if Yao is in Yongzhou now,

431
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,220
we will meet later.

432
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,220
I heard he has been in a lot of business lately.

433
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,220
He will be in front of us.

434
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
If you are not here,

435
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
I am afraid I can't get rid of him.

436
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
Go.

437
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,220
You go first.

438
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,220
I will go to you when you two are in Yongzhou.

439
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,220
Okay.

440
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,220
Don't persuade me.

441
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,220
We have our own ideas.

442
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,220
You stay in the capital to take care of yourself.

443
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,220
Come to me if you need anything.

444
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,220
Uncle.

445
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,220
Uncle.

446
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Chen Zhong.

447
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,220
Take care.

448
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,220
Ye Biao.

449
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
You.

450
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,220
Good brother.

451
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,220
Thank you for coming to see me off.

452
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,220
Take care.

453
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,220
Take care.

454
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,220
I will miss you.

455
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,220
Take care.

456
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,220
Let's go.

457
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,220
Jiang Jingrui.

458
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,220
Take care of Liu Xi.

459
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,220
Don't worry.

460
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,220
Let's go.

461
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,220
Let's go.

462
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,220
Be careful.

463
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,220
Uncle.

464
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,220
Take care.

465
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,220
Now,

466
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,220
you can do whatever you want.

467
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,220
Just remember,

468
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,220
if you have any questions,

469
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,220
come to me in Yongzhou.

470
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:57,220
I wish you all the best in Yongzhou.

471
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
Everything is fine.

472
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,220
Okay.

473
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,220
Take care.

474
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,220
Okay.

475
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,220
Father.

476
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,220
Father.

477
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,220
It's getting cold.

478
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,220
I forgot to put on my clothes.

479
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,220
Don't catch a cold.

480
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
You should go back to the State of State.

481
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,220
I will send you off.

482
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,220
I...

483
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,220
Although Uncle Jiang is not in the capital,

484
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,220
I am still here.

485
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,220
If you need anything,

486
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,220
you can come to me anytime.

487
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,220
You know I am not...

488
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,220
Biao.

489
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,220
You are not a brother.

490
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,220
You can take me as your brother.

491
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,220
Brother.

492
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,220
Let's go.

493
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,220
Okay.

494
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,220
You are not going to the airport?

495
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,220
The King of Cheng was expelled.

496
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,220
He took over the army.

497
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,220
He thinks this is the best time to enter the capital.

498
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,220
We must take the opportunity

499
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,220
to stop the yearning.

500
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,220
I am sorry.

501
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,220
I am sorry.

502
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,220
I am sorry.

503
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,220
I am sorry.

504
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,220
I am sorry.

505
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,220
I am sorry.

506
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:17,220
At that time,

507
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,360
there are actors

508
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,420
that abuse the economy today.

509
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,220
These people in the Palace

510
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,220
and Rsc in the North

511
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
may have their moments of yearning.

512
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,220
But if you don't care about a transfer,

513
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,220
go to come back.

514
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,900
Advice

515
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,220
Lu Ji!

516
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,220
Lu Ji!

517
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,220
Lu Ji!

518
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,220
Mom!

519
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,220
Mom!

520
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,220
Lu Ji!

521
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,220
Mom!

522
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,220
I'll take you back!

523
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,220
I'll take you back!

524
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,220
Mom!

525
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,220
Lu Ji!

526
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,220
Wen Ji!

527
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,220
Wen Ji!

528
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,220
Wen Ji!

529
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,220
Wen Ji!

530
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,220
Wen Ji!

531
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,220
Wen Ji!

532
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,220
I'll take you back!

533
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,220
You're so weak!

534
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,220
You're going to kill me!

535
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,220
I'll take you back!

536
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,220
Wen Ji!

537
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,220
Wen Ji!

538
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,220
Wen Ji!

539
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,220
Wen Ji!

540
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,220
Wen Ji!

541
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,220
Wen Ji!

542
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,220
Wen Ji!

543
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,220
When will you come back?

544
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,220
The day when the candle didn't bloom

545
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,220
is the day when I was in peace.

546
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,220
Wen Ji!

547
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,220
Get up!

548
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:40,220
If there is no happy memory

549
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:48,220
how can it pass through the sad and sad past?

550
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:54,220
The cold and ruthless life

551
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,220
is the hand that holds the hand

552
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:02,220
how can it pass through the snow?

553
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,220
In the cold wind

554
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,220
in the long night

555
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:17,220
the warmth that is left behind

556
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:22,220
is too deep

557
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,220
and not firm

558
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:32,220
Can you bury the traces of yesterday?

559
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:39,220
Love is a life

560
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:48,220
I'll live on even if I'm hurt

561
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,220
No matter how much I love you

562
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,220
I believe in you

563
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:02,220
I'd rather be trapped in the world

564
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:10,220
I'll continue to hold on to all my courage

565
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:18,220
I'll continue to love until I'm free

566
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,220
The scenery of the full moon

567
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:26,220
is only for you

568
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:32,220
The sky is not far away after the dawn

569
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:41,220
The sky is not far away after the dawn
