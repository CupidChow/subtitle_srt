1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,660
When it's bad, we shouldểu

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And rain will return to the ordinary

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
V reshor

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,920
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,320
Now the Ye family is fighting for the heat.

17
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,320
Why are you running out alone?

18
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,640
The heat is their...

19
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,400
and I have no relationship with them.

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Do you want to drink?

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,960
What do you mean?

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,280
Zhuang Yi Zhuang, you're bold enough to say that to me.

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,720
I'm afraid that if you say it halfway,

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,120
you'll run away.

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,120
Even if I say halfway,

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,400
and you run away,

27
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,400
you can't guess.

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,200
Duke Su,

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,720
how did you do the case before?

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,840
You don't have to be so bold.

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,080
You're more than a play for me.

32
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,440
You couldn't save me

33
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,120
in the Duke's mansion.

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
I'll make it up today.

35
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,440
You're a good memory.

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,080
Be bold.

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,200
People don't force you.

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,280
They won't tell the truth.

39
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,600
In that case,

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,000
can you ask me

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,600
a crime that's forced you to be a noble lady?

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,560
I can fight with you every day.

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,600
Can you let me in today?

44
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,960
What's your name?

45
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,040
Another question.

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,560
No, this is my rule.

47
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,440
Then I don't believe you.

48
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,120
What's your name?

49
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,840
I don't know.

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
What's your habit?

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm a ghost on the mountain.

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm not Jiang Li.

53
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,040
I know.

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
You're a...

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Little cat?

56
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,640
You're so long.

57
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,040
You're still so ungrateful.

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,560
That's more like a lie.

59
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Duke Su,

60
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,040
you're really...

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,560
unique.

62
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,880
I don't care if the world is talking about me,

63
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,480
or if it's forcing me.

64
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,040
A lie is a thousand years.

65
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,920
It doesn't matter.

66
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,120
Everything is fine.

67
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,640
I'm not nobody's friend.

68
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,560
Why do you do such things?

69
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,240
Xiaoyiguang.

70
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,880
I'm thinking

71
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,200
you must be afraid of Tong Zhiyang.

72
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
I'll treat you to riceクロ防 today.

73
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,760
Li Ji.

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Prime Minister Su,

75
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:36,240
aren't we supposed to know

76
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,360
the truth until we lose ourselves?

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
That's exactly whatYEAR dieser gloveavor Einsatz

78
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,440
is for.

79
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,760
You mean that...

80
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,120
when you said we have lost ourselves,

81
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,200
we knew we didn't have to make any mistakes?

82
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,120
You're right.

83
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,780
No.

84
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,380
Edward Xie.

85
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,180
It's like a fairy tale.

86
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,660
It's your encounter with a whole prophet.

87
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,100
Can you blame us?

88
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,420
Please let me

89
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,860
just go to your house.

90
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,300
Edward Xie.

91
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,260
Just go.

92
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,260
Enough.

93
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,700
This is nothing compared to

94
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,220
how good you were

95
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,020
I think you're not ashamed of your past.

96
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,540
So you dare to ask the UK

97
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,220
to be honest.

98
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,260
You suddenly look serious.

99
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,380
You're really a good cook.

100
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,260
It's okay.

101
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,860
After today,

102
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,660
I'm a bad person again.

103
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,420
Lu Yang is so good.

104
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,220
It's too late.

105
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,220
You want to go home?

106
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,020
Then go home.

107
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,620
That's not my home.

108
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,980
Li.

109
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,020
For a criminal,

110
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,260
the life of Yemin is important.

111
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,100
But for anyone,

112
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,500
there's no need to compare.

113
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,460
Lu Yang's family σε is now set on fire.

114
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,540
If you really got married to a ghost,

115
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,140
you would be醒 by now.

116
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,300
I will be very active.

117
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,220
The first day of the trip

118
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,220
The first day of the trip

119
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,220
The first day of the trip

120
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,220
The first day of the trip

121
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,220
The first day of the trip

122
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,220
The first day of the trip

123
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,220
The first day of the trip

124
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,220
The first day of the trip

125
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,220
The first day of the trip

126
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,220
The first day of the trip

127
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,220
The first day of the trip

128
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,220
The first day of the trip

129
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,220
The first day of the trip

130
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,220
The first day of the trip

131
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,220
The first day of the trip

132
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,220
Let me go

133
00:06:47,220 --> 00:07:08,140
Where am I

134
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,820
Let me

135
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,480
Youal right.

136
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,580
You can't be like this

137
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,100
but your heart won't dry

138
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,180
Being beautiful and beautiful

139
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,540
is more beautiful than floats

140
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,780
State Master Su, do you think

141
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,780
I have magistrate's blood

142
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,140
after all this is lost?

143
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,980
To a human,

144
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,100
it's obvious

145
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,820
Yanming is very important.

146
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,820
But for people,

147
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,020
it's not necessary to be separated.

148
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,420
Lu Yang City is a big city now.

149
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,460
If you really knew how to be a ghost,

150
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,260
you would have been killed long ago.

151
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
Go home.

152
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,980
Waiter

153
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,340
You ink this

154
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,740
Electric abandon

155
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,180
Fill the atmosphere

156
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,380
I have no burden anymore

157
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,380
Sister, a servant ordered that a housewife

158
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,820
are going to look for her somewhere for you.

159
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,500
Who is it?

160
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,500
Qiu Zhi.

161
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,820
Qiu Zhi?

162
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,140
The woman from Jiang City is here.

163
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,220
Really?

164
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,900
So nice.

165
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,060
Send her here.

166
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,040
Her color is so nice.

167
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,700
feminine, send her here.

168
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,020
That painting is really pretty.

169
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,540
Send her out.

170
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,240
It's such a beautiful landscape.

171
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,100
Do you come here to ask your father for a favor?

172
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,520
Sure.

173
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,660
Go say something more.

174
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,700
That way,

175
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,980
Are you here to see Qiong Zhi's wife?

176
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,900
Yes.

177
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,460
The medicine is on.

178
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,260
Drink it up.

179
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,020
May I ask

180
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,980
what's wrong with Qiong Zhi?

181
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,860
Tong'er, wait here.

182
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:08,940
CHENG

183
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,520
Qiong Zhi.

184
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,540
Qiong Zhi.

185
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,500
Xiang Erniang.

186
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,180
You can go there yourself.

187
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,620
What's wrong with you?

188
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,260
I thought I'd go find you.

189
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,420
I didn't expect

190
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,900
may he be coming.

191
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,820
Any news?

192
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,380
Xiang Erniang is also элект особенно.

193
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,060
Finally, she's not Blood Lady.

194
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,340
So many people are murderous.

195
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,980
I don't think it's汝 landsingers.

196
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,500
click away the wire of death by weiße.

197
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,100
As you said,

198
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,900
if I've become Artemisia someone else,

199
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,300
I don't need to be someone else.

200
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,540
Me too.

201
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,580
How many years ago a carelessness managed to lose to you,

202
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,940
now it's become a misery.

203
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,860
Darned!

204
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,060
After I manage to save him,

205
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,820
he is killed.

206
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,980
How people face the private cell now,

207
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,660
and aunt's life is slowly running out.

208
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
You are a high-ranking royal physician.

209
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,660
You must follow the funeral.

210
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,660
In this world,

211
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,660
someone must come back to ask about the cause.

212
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,660
You must be fair to the money.

213
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,660
Thank you, Lei.

214
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,660
I didn't die.

215
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Really?

216
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,660
A thousand days ago,

217
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,660
Xinhua Dragon came to the temple of the bad smell.

218
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,660
Little Piggy.

219
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,660
Where are you going?

220
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,660
Chief Feng.

221
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,660
Chief Feng.

222
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
Why are you here?

223
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
You said I...

224
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
Let me out.

225
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,660
Chief Cui.

226
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
Chief Cui.

227
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,660
Chief Cui is not in good health today.

228
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
We have three young ladies here.

229
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,660
They are very nice.

230
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,660
Ning Lian.

231
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,660
Yuer.

232
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,660
Yuer.

233
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
Hurry up.

234
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Coming.

235
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,660
I am in a hurry.

236
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,660
Come on.

237
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Xin'er.

238
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,660
We need to help.

239
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,660
These people

240
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
came here before.

241
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,660
They want to be helped by Cui.

242
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,660
They have a lot of money.

243
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
Wait.

244
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,660
Where is Cui?

245
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,660
He is in the temple.

246
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,660
You can't go there.

247
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,660
I will go.

248
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,660
You can't go there.

249
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,660
I will go.

250
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,660
I will go.

251
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,660
When Chief Cui was alive,

252
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,660
they were holding a bottle.

253
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Give it to him.

254
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,660
What are you doing?

255
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
What are you doing?

256
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
Let me go.

257
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Let me go!

258
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,660
Feng Xianliang, please!

259
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660
Let me go!

260
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,660
Let me go!

261
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,660
Let me go!

262
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,660
Don't hit her!

263
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,660
Let me go!

264
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,660
Let me go!

265
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
No!

266
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
Xiao Zhuang!

267
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,660
Cui Zhuang.

268
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,660
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

269
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
It's me, Cui Zhuang.

270
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,660
I'll report this to the Lord of the Clouds.

271
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,660
No!

272
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,660
Xiao Zhuang, don't!

273
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,660
I still need this money to give my mother a cure.

274
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,660
Don't!

275
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,660
Two days ago, the three of us came again.

276
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,660
The guards refused to go.

277
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,660
Let's get married.

278
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
Let's get married.

279
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,660
Let's be a family.

280
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,660
I'll go.

281
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,660
Xiao Zhuang.

282
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,660
After Feng Xianliang was killed,

283
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
no one was able to die.

284
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,660
It was a civil war half a year later.

285
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,660
But now,

286
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,660
it's almost the end of the civil war.

287
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
I can escape from their mouths.

288
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660
That's all I have.

289
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,660
It's okay.

290
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,660
I'm just a little bit confused.

291
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,660
I'm afraid I can't wait for justice.

292
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,660
I will.

293
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,660
You must wait

294
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,660
to see those people.

295
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,660
See what happens to them.

296
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,660
Qiu Chi, I will return to Huai Xiang.

297
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,660
I will return to justice for you.

298
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,660
I will return to the Xue family.

299
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,660
I will return to justice for the Xue family.

300
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,660
I will personally catch those things that are not as good as the pig's.

301
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,660
I will pull their skin and drink their blood.

302
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,660
I swear.

303
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,660
You must live well.

304
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,660
Who has such a friend like you?

305
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,660
You are so lucky.

306
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660
Jiang Erniang.

307
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,660
Do you remember the map of this river?

308
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,660
Xue Zhao is not a person who doesn't learn anything.

309
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,660
This map is not a mistake.

310
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,660
I just use it every day.

311
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,660
I don't know what it will give me.

312
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Xue Zhao's blood.

313
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,660
I left it to you.

314
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,660
You can take it.

315
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,660
Qiu Chi, wait.

316
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,660
I will call the doctor back.

317
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,660
Thank you.

318
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,660
I have my own body and my own heart.

319
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,660
When I first came to the Xinhua House,

320
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,660
I was so worried.

321
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,660
I was so worried.

322
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,660
Now I understand.

323
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,660
The old man also made me live.

324
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,660
It's for you.

325
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,660
Sister.

326
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,660
You must remember.

327
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:32,660
You must take the credit for the people who helped you.

328
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,660
Okay. I will get the medicine.

329
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,660
Cheng.

330
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
Cheng.

331
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,660
I am here to thank you.

332
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,660
I miss you.

333
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,660
I have no other choice.

334
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,660
I have no other choice.

335
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,660
Qiu Chi.

336
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,660
I follow the wind and sand.

337
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,660
I float to the sky.

338
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,660
Qiu Chi.

339
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,660
I am so happy.

340
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,660
There is a word.

341
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,660
I want to ask you a question.

342
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,660
A word.

343
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,660
If it is a flower,

344
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,660
tell me.

345
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:19,660
I wish to go home with you.

346
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,660
Lord.

347
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,660
I have asked the Lord.

348
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,660
The gold of Chu Lan is one year old.

349
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,660
It is made of gold.

350
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
Is it gold?

351
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,660
It is not the gold of the court.

352
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,660
It is a diamond.

353
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,660
Gold is broken.

354
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,660
It seems that there is gold mine nearby.

355
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,660
No way.

356
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,660
The south wind caused the sea.

357
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,660
The court is so crazy.

358
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,660
Lu Yang's wind and sand is not yet broken.

359
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,660
There is no gold mine nearby.

360
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,660
The mine is gone.

361
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,660
My god.

362
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,660
The gold is the gold of the court.

363
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,660
It is the most dangerous.

364
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
But we don't know where the gold is.

365
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,660
It is not hidden.

366
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,660
They are not very powerful.

367
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,660
The gold mine can be opened in a short time.

368
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,660
It is usually the sand mine opened by the sky.

369
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
Wen Ji.

370
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,660
You are talking about the wind and sand.

371
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,660
Go to the water.

372
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,660
Yes.

373
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,660
Li.

374
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,660
I will give you some good斷子.

375
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,660
Li.

376
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,660
Li.

377
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,660
Eat some melon seeds.

378
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,660
Li.

379
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,660
My cousin.

380
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,660
This flower is as beautiful as you.

381
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,660
I will put it in your room.

382
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,660
I will give you some.

383
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,660
I will give you some.

384
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,660
I will give you some.

385
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,660
I will give you some.

386
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,660
Li.

387
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,660
I will put it in your room.

388
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Do you like it?

389
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,660
Where is he?

390
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,660
What happened?

391
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,660
He is not in a good mood.

392
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,660
He is not in a good mood.

393
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,660
He is like the last time.

394
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,660
He is strong and strong.

395
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,660
He is so scary.

396
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,660
No.

397
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,660
We should find someone to look at him.

398
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,660
Why are you looking at me?

399
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,660
I am so stupid.

400
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,660
I am not good at comforting people.

401
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,660
Then, you can drink.

402
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
My cousin.

403
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
Where are you going with the bag?

404
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,660
I have something important to do.

405
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,660
What is it?

406
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,660
Tell me.

407
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,660
Tell me.

408
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,660
My cousin.

409
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,660
I know something important.

410
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,660
Tell me.

411
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,660
I will give you more strength.

412
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,660
I have met a sister.

413
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,660
If not for her,

414
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,660
I would not have survived.

415
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
Then, she died.

416
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,660
She told me before she died.

417
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,660
Her father was the one who killed Huai Xiang.

418
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,660
She was killed by someone.

419
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,660
I am so sorry.

420
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,660
I am sorry.

421
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,660
I am so sorry.

422
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,660
I am sorry.

423
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,660
I am sorry.

424
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,660
No one wanted to die.

425
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,660
No one wanted to die.

426
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,660
She was trapped in Zhen Yu Hall.

427
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,660
She was not able to feed her father.

428
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,660
She said, if one day I return,

429
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,660
I will help her to leave the flower on his father's grave.

430
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,660
In this way,

431
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,660
we can see each other again.

432
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,660
Then, I will go find someone.

433
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,660
I only knew that

434
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,660
his father was not dead.

435
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,660
But was locked up in the prison of Huai Xiang.

436
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,660
You want to investigate his father's case?

437
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,740
Biao.

438
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,660
Do you think I shouldn't have done this?

439
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,700
I know Ah Li.

440
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,540
He won't ask me if I should or shouldn't.

441
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,780
As long as it's a righteous thing,

442
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,300
he will be very kind.

443
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,460
Tell me.

444
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,220
When will you go?

445
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,980
I'll go with you.

446
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,660
I'll pack up my things right now.

447
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,620
Biao.

448
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,260
Er Jiu just got home.

449
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,060
You still need to handle the business of the single-handedly business.

450
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,460
You need to stay at Ye's house.

451
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,740
Huai Xiang.

452
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,420
I'll go by myself.

453
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,540
Don't go out with me.

454
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,500
There are other places to go.

455
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,740
But Huai Xiang...

456
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,620
I'm worried.

457
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,700
What do you mean?

458
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,380
Ye's house used to have a shop in Huai Xiang.

459
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,940
But after the Xie Ling was changed...

460
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,620
Don't be afraid.

461
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,700
Chief Yang.

462
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,220
Your shop has been in a good condition for the last month.

463
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,860
What?

464
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,100
You guys are still in the same place

465
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,260
as Ye's house in Huai Xiang.

466
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:23,860
Sir.

467
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,460
Our dormitory and dormitory

468
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,860
are all on the same level.

469
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,540
But...

470
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,940
We have a sleeping stick that you guys gave us.

471
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,820
Sir, wait.

472
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,860
I'll give you the answer.

473
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,020
Mom.

474
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,700
You dare to make a sleeping stick?

475
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,780
It seems that you want to

476
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,980
take us home with you today.

477
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,460
Come on.

478
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,460
Take us away.

479
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,140
Sir.

480
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,780
Sir.

481
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,380
Sir.

482
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:41,900
Sir.

483
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,260
Sir.

484
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,860
Sir.

485
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,540
Sir.

486
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,260
I'll pack up my things.

487
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,060
Such a peaceful place.

488
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,540
Now it's like this.

489
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,940
It's so dirty.

490
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,140
Our business can't be maintained.

491
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,940
So I took it back.

492
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,980
Now you're going there.

493
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,180
I have to accompany you to say something.

494
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,500
You shouldn't go there today.

495
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:02,860
I'll go.

496
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,300
Uncle.

497
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,820
You're going to listen to us.

498
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,420
If I don't listen to you,

499
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,620
I don't know you two girls.

500
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,900
One of you is in the bed.

501
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,500
The other is going to the heaven.

502
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,180
Don't underestimate me.

503
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,060
I'm going there.

504
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,660
You should stay at home.

505
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,940
You're a little girl.

506
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,260
Although you lost the Escort,

507
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,580
you can't use the escort's skills.

508
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,340
But it's okay to bring Ah Li.

509
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,900
If you want to go to the court,

510
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,180
what if something happens?

511
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,700
Who am I?

512
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,260
You...

513
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,380
Sister.

514
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,420
You stay at Ye's house.

515
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,980
I don't know

516
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,940
how to deal with the second uncle and second aunt.

517
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,460
You have to tell me clearly.

518
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,380
You have to help me.

519
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,260
Okay.

520
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,100
Leave the house to me.

521
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,740
If you have anything to do there,

522
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,500
just tell me.

523
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,820
I'll go there immediately.

524
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,220
Okay.

525
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,940
I'll leave you to it.

526
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,860
I found it, Lord.

527
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,180
It's a murder.

528
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,340
I followed the water path on the mountain.

529
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,860
I saw it when I walked down.

530
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,900
It's so mysterious.

531
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,780
It's not.

532
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,100
The name of the public police

533
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,500
is the name of the murder.

534
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,460
It looks like it's a murder in the daytime.

535
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,660
But the coincidence of the public police

536
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,500
is spreading the secret.

537
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,900
The public police

538
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,820
is holding the closed gold mine.

539
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,940
Guess what?

540
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,100
The mine is open.

541
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,660
So they don't only escape the murder,

542
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,100
but also the gold mine.

543
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,860
But it's impossible.

544
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,740
The day before the murder,

545
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,300
they're going to open the mine.

546
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,540
They have so much power.

547
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,580
Where is the gold mine now?

548
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,860
In Huai Xiang.

549
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,740
Huai Xiang?

550
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,860
Is it a coincidence?

551
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,180
The Xue Huaiyuan in the desert

552
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,580
was the county magistrate there.

553
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,540
That's so strange.

554
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,620
When did the Nisha factory start?

555
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,940
About half a year ago.

556
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,820
Half a year ago,

557
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,020
Xue Huaiyuan entered the prison.

558
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,900
The Nisha factory started.

559
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,620
The chief said

560
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,740
it has something to do with the Xue family.

561
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,740
They can take the gold mine by themselves.

562
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,940
But they want to open the closed gold mine

563
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,300
in Huai Xiang.

564
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,140
Even the capital's hand is not

565
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,940
able to get the local teeth.

566
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,020
What's so hard about it?

567
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,980
It's just that they can't get it.

568
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,460
Lu Yang's dog suit

569
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,100
didn't have teeth on it.

570
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,740
What if they can't get it?

571
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,820
Then it's just...

572
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,180
The chief wants

573
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,380
Li Zhongnan to kill Xue Huaiyuan

574
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,700
for the private gold mine.

575
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,620
Xue Fangfei and Xie Zhao's death

576
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,900
is not just because they offended Wanning.

577
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,580
They're afraid that Xue Huaiyuan

578
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,380
would expose this to the children.

579
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,060
So they killed them.

580
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,300
It seems I have to go to Huai Xiang.

581
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,220
Chief,

582
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,860
you're going to go to Huai Xiang suddenly.

583
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,820
Do you want to tell me about it?

584
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,580
Where do I need to report to?

585
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,300
It's okay to say it.

586
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,460
Brother,

587
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,020
why don't you send for

588
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,240
Xie Zhao and Li Zhongnan to theonductor

589
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,580
They're serious about their company,

590
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,500
and want to talk with us for some finds.

591
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,460
I don't think so.

592
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,960
Li Zhongnan Lianfeng Lianfeng

593
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,300
it's...

594
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,500
riju

595
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,180
It must have been a big problem for Lady XiaMcAway.

596
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,100
Growing love itself applies!

597
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,980
If I marry you again,

598
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,660
you won't change your future with a new pee,

599
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,740
okay?

600
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,220
Clean your soul or wash your hands!

601
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,500
What are you looking at?

602
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,500
Don't think that too much.

603
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Which one is better?

604
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
I want this one.

605
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
You want this one?

606
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Yes.

607
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Okay.

608
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
This one.

609
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
This one.

610
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Yes.

611
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Children, come back.

612
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Come back to class.

613
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
Children, listen to the teacher.

614
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Go back to class.

615
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,500
After class,

616
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Uncle Xue will treat you to candy.

617
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Okay.

618
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Thank you, uncle.

619
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,500
Go.

620
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Go to school.

621
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
After school, go to school.

622
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Come back.

623
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
Come back to class.

624
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Come back to class.

625
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Hurry up.

626
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Go back to class.

627
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Go back to the garden.

628
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,500
What happened to Huai Xiang in the past six months?

629
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Let's take a rest here.

630
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Boss.

631
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Here.

632
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Boss.

633
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
Isn't this a guest room?

634
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Why does this place look like a casino?

635
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,620
No wonder people don't dare to say that.

636
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,460
These people are all from the county.

637
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,660
Put on your hands.

638
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,780
Be late.

639
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,260
I'm not gambling anymore.

640
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,380
Don't go.

641
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:57,900
Where are you going?

642
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,220
Just continue playing.

643
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,340
I don't have money.

644
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,580
I really don't have money.

645
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,060
Don't you have a house?

646
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,300
This is also okay.

647
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,100
I don't have money.

648
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,540
I don't have money.

649
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,300
What are you playing with?

650
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,260
You don't have money, do you?

651
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,740
I can't care about it.

652
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,940
It's very important.

653
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,140
You can still take care of it.

654
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,340
Dad, give me two houses.

655
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,900
Ten houses in total.

656
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,140
Ten houses?

657
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,020
Why don't you go rob them?

658
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,100
The seven cities must be given to the officials.

659
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,420
Otherwise, I can't even go to the small shop.

660
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,620
I...

661
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,340
I...

662
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,860
Let's go.

663
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,020
I know a place.

664
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,660
I don't believe that I can't find a quiet place.

665
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,940
Look at the kids running away.

666
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,380
They are so happy.

667
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,500
Take some home.

668
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,700
This...

669
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,660
There is a inn here.

670
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,380
Uncle.

671
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,660
There is a yard over there.

672
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,180
It should be empty.

673
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,100
Go ask them

674
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,940
if they can live for a while.

675
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,900
How do you know?

676
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,860
I guess so.

677
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,620
Uncle.

678
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,220
Let's go.

679
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,460
Ms. Xu.

680
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,980
This is a gift for you.

681
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,580
It's just a little�stuff for me.

682
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,860
Take it away.

683
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,020
Fine.

684
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,380
You're looking at it again.

685
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,020
Shut up.

686
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,140
We need to see

687
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,340
which son

688
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,740
can make us look at him.

689
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,100
I've always wanted to see him.

690
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,220
You said that he's been

691
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,740
always so kind to others.

692
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,180
He's rejected you.

693
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,340
What kind of person

694
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,620
does he like?

695
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,420
Chen Yaguan.

696
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,740
Chunfang.

697
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,340
Li.

698
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,060
Thank you, Li.

699
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,620
Club Master Building

700
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,260
Herbal aggi forgot to mentions

701
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,900
ShuiAI,

702
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,380
why is this love house closed down?

703
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,180
I didn't mean to.

704
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,420
I just wanted to know

705
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,660
who allowed them to go home.

706
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
Hurry back to your room.

707
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,660
You are so stupid.

708
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,660
There is a room in front that can help people.

709
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
Ah Shun, go and clean up first.

710
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,660
Yes, Miss.

711
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,660
Go and move the luggage.

712
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,660
Okay, go ahead.

713
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,660
Let's go to Xianyang.

714
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,660
I will go to the city hall.

715
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,660
I will go to the city hall.

716
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,660
I will go to the city hall.

717
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,660
I will go to the city hall.

718
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,660
I will go to the city hall.

719
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,660
I will go to the city hall.

720
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,660
I will go to the city hall.

721
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,660
Let's go to Xianyang.

722
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,660
Why are you going there?

723
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,660
The bad smell of the present

724
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,660
and me.

725
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,660
My friend has different personality.

726
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,660
He is from the original family.

727
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,660
I want to see

728
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,660
what is the real color of Xianyang

729
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,660
on the main hall.

730
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,660
But we just arrived here.

731
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,660
We will go to Xianyang.

732
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,660
Will we clean up the city hall?

733
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,660
Then we will trouble uncle.

734
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,660
Let's go.

735
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,660
Let's go.

736
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,660
Go.

737
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,660
Who is this?

738
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,660
What are you doing here?

739
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,660
My friend,

740
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,660
you can't control

741
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,660
other people's affairs.

742
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,660
I am more powerful than him.

743
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,660
Come on.

744
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,660
Look at me.

745
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,660
Look at me.

746
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,660
You are dead.

747
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,660
I am not afraid of anything.

748
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,660
Kill me.

749
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,660
Go.

750
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,660
Look.

751
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,660
You hit me with so many things

752
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,660
and you hit me with so many people.

753
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,660
Take him back and punish him.

754
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,660
Why is the bones still missing?

755
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,660
Who is it?

756
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,660
It's a coincidence.

757
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,660
I am a dreamer.

758
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,660
Press the button first.

759
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,660
Hit 20 times.

760
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,660
This... This is not a missing...

761
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,660
Feng Xianling,

762
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,660
I am the daughter of the imperial minister of the imperial court,

763
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,660
the daughter of the imperial minister of the imperial minister of the imperial court,

764
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,660
Jiang Li.

765
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,660
You are the daughter of the most official.

766
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,660
How dare you take the daughter of the imperial court's official?

767
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,660
Come on.

768
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,660
Grab her.

769
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,660
Hit her.

770
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
You dare to touch me.

771
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,660
I will kill you.

772
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,660
Feng Xianling, you are clear.

773
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,660
You are the one who killed me today.

774
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,660
You are your own life.

775
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,660
You are the daughter of the unlawful and unlawful Ming family.

776
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,660
You are so ungrateful.

777
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,660
You are the daughter of the imperial minister of the imperial court.

778
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,660
You are so dirty.

779
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,660
You... You are really...

780
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,660
I don't know who Feng Xianling is.

781
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,660
But my father is the imperial minister of the imperial court.

782
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,660
If I have a short life,

783
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,660
don't think about the whole Huaixiang.

784
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,660
So you are the head of the imperial court.

785
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,660
You are so filial.

786
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,660
I am not a mountaineer.

787
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,660
Please forgive me.

788
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,660
What's the matter with you?

789
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,660
Can I help you?

790
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,660
You are my man.

791
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,660
What's wrong?

792
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,660
The one who was careful in the casino just now.

793
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,660
The casino.

794
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,660
The casino.

795
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,660
The casino.

796
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,660
The casino.

797
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,660
Qingrou's casino is not here.

798
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,660
We are just in Huaixiang.

799
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,660
The one who was in the casino.

800
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,660
I know that.

801
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,660
That's so stupid.

802
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,660
It's a casino that's been smashed.

803
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,660
But since the second wife is here to ask for help,

804
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,660
we have to change it.

805
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,660
But it's a casino that's been smashed.

806
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,660
It's not interesting.

807
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,660
I'm a little too bullied.

808
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,660
Look.

809
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,660
Tong An.

810
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
Tong An.

811
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,660
I didn't expect Feng Xianlin to be so thoughtful.

812
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,660
You are a good husband.

813
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,660
There's no way.

814
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,660
I am a husband and wife.

815
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,660
I am always worried about the people.

816
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,660
Go and let go of her.

817
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,660
Why didn't the second wife come to Huaixiang?

818
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,660
Why didn't she tell us in advance?

819
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,660
We are small in place.

820
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,660
We are not in the way.

821
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,660
How about this?

822
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,660
Do you have any plans?

823
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,660
I'll take care of the garden.

824
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,660
No need.

825
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,660
I'm here to learn business with my uncle.

826
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,660
I didn't ask my father to take care of it.

827
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,660
Of course, Feng Xianlin will arrange it.

828
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,660
Great.

829
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,660
The second wife is so noble.

830
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,660
But she is so considerate.

831
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,660
She is the model of my learning.

832
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,660
What about you?

833
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,660
Come here.

834
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,660
How to make money?

835
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,660
This is all new official business.

836
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,660
I have to clean it up.

837
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,660
Xianlin.

838
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,660
I am so sorry.

839
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,660
The people in our family

840
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,660
are all so kind.

841
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,660
They are so mean.

842
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,660
I am a new maid.

843
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,660
I can't control them.

844
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,660
Uncle.

845
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,660
Since you are fine,

846
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,660
we should go.

847
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
Thank you, Feng Xianlin.

848
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,660
Wait.

849
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,660
If there is anything

850
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,660
that the second wife told me,

851
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,660
I will definitely give it to her.

852
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,660
Thank you.

853
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,660
They are so nice.

854
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,660
The people in our family

855
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,660
are all so kind.

856
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,660
They are so kind.

857
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,660
They are so kind

858
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,660
in their age.

859
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
They are so kind.

860
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,660
Why don't you look at them?

861
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,660
Granny, are you okay?

862
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,660
I am fine.

863
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,660
I am fine.

864
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,660
I am fine.

865
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,660
I am fine.

866
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,660
I am fine.

867
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,660
I am fine.

868
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,660
I am fine.

869
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,660
I am fine.

870
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,660
I am fine.

871
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,660
I am fine.

872
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,660
I am fine.

873
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,660
I am fine.

874
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,660
I am fine.

875
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,660
I am fine.

876
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,660
I am fine.

877
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,660
I am fine.

878
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,660
I am fine.

879
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,660
I am fine.
