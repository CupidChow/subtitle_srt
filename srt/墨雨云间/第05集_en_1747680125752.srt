The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sister, why did Duke Su ask you to come here today?

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Maybe he's not happy that I used him to return to the Jiang family.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He was testing me today.

6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He must have some doubts about my identity.

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is it dangerous for you?

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's okay. I've made it clear to him.

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We can just not bother him anymore.

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There will be a big problem in the future.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't take this jade pendant as your last resort.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No one deserves to give up on this jade pendant.

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Madam, Jiang Yu'e wants to see you.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
She's already here.

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Sister.

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is Jiang Yu'e, the only daughter of the third room.

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
She likes to bully others.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
She's always been Jiang Ruoyao's follower.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is the song book that Third Sister gave you.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
She even invited you to go to the yard to read it.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Sister, you're so kind.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm so grateful.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Sister, I'm sorry.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I didn't mean to do that.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I just wanted to help you.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What?

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How did you do that on purpose?

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The Jiang family is getting more and more unruly.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Even a maid dares to lecture her master.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How dare you!

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How dare you!

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
How dare you!

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're so precious.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Please take away the dirt on your body.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's a waste of money if you stay with me.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're so kind.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've already sent Third Sister's message.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You can do it yourself.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why is she still the same as when she was a kid?

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
She's soft and tough.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
She's a bad person.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I...

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I...

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It seems that I should go to meet this third lady.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll go with you.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Second Sister.

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I think it's Ruo Yang.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's such a good song.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It stopped halfway.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a pity.

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You've been in Zhen Nu Hall for many years.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You know music?

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I've learned a little from Zhen Nu.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's not a big deal.

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This zither is not mine.

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Last time I passed by the teahouse,

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I heard a song playing.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I heard it for the first time.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I heard it for the first time.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I heard it for the first time.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This time I passed by the teahouse,

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I heard a song playing.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The zither is a good zither,

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
but the song playing is not good.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's ruined.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I just took it back to play.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's broken now.

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I should throw it away.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The zither is broken.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Not really.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There are some things that are mine,

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
they are mine.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Even if I don't want them,

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
it's not others' turn.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
How do you know

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
what you don't want,

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
will be what others want?

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's best not to want them.

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Otherwise, the result will be very unkind.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't want them.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't want them.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't want them.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't want them.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't want them.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Sister,

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
you should have passed the festival.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Tomorrow, I will be at the ceremony.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You must come.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Of course.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
At this time,

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I will definitely send you a gift.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Qing Hua.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
My lady.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Take out my best clothes and jewelry.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Tomorrow at the ceremony,

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I will show her

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
what is the real lady of the Jiang family.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Is Ruo Yao asleep?

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
She hasn't slept yet.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I asked Jin Hua.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
She said that the third lady

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
opened the cabinet

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and turned the clothes and jewelry

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
over and tried them on.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
She couldn't even sleep.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The daughters of the Jiang family

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
are all in good shape.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But no matter how good the clothes and jewelry are,

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
who can they be compared to in terms of discipline?

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The third lady

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
is still young after all.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
She is pure in mind.

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Then we have to think about her more.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I will keep the third lady's discipline

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
intact.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
My lady.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
My lady.

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is the salt-soup soup

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
that I cooked in the kitchen.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
My lady asked me

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
to bring it to you to nourish your body.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This soup

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
will become beautiful after drinking it.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Is there anything else?

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
My lady.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This salt-soup soup

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
will become beautiful

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
after drinking it.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I will drink the salt-soup soup

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
when you go downstairs.

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay.

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Tong'er.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Sister.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yinzhen.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yinzhen?

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This is too much.

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I will go to find the old lady and Zhu Jun.

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It must be the poisonous hand that Ji Shuran put on.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Although there is a false evidence,

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
who dares to be the witness

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
who will kill the person after he is admitted?

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What should we do?

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What if this is something that will cost your life?

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If I die in the Jiang family,

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Ji Shuran will have to

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
beg the government for mercy.

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's not necessary for me to die.

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This poison

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
should just not let me

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
appear in the discipline.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Tong'er.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Tong'er.

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This salt-soup soup

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
is so delicious.

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh my god, Sister Xiao Qiao.

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Are you okay?

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I...

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm alright.

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I just...

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I was waiting for my wife.

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I was waiting for her to hold the bowl.

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
My dear.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Why are you so tired?

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm just tired from work.

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I just feel...

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I just feel tired from work.

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I just feel tired.

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I just feel tired from work.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I just feel tired from work.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I just feel tired from work.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
My lady, you drank it all?

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes.

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This pork salt soup is really delicious.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
My lady, you look beautiful all of a sudden.

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I think so too.

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're so clean.

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So beautiful.

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Tong'er, come with me.

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Find a way out.

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
My lady, as you expected,

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Jiang Li Jia drank a few sips and then she spilled it.

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
She's very thoughtful.

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
She's been in Zhen Nv Tang for so long.

187
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
She should have the ability to deal with it.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is to remove her guard.

189
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll do the rest as I said.

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The time has come.

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If you don't let me go, don't blame me for not playing with you.

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What's this?

193
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
These are not mine.

194
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Burn it.

195
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Wow.

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Wow, it's so fun.

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Wow, it's so fun.

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This...

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This is all money.

200
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's not yours. Why are you making noise?

201
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I just...

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Who saw you burning it?

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't believe in money.

204
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I can't open a casino and I can't open a brothel.

205
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Unlike you.

206
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What's wrong, Mr. Qin?

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You've been living with me for days.

208
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You can't get money from your account.

209
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The factory is going to collapse.

210
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I didn't.

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I can catch every private criminal under you.

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You've been playing for a long time.

213
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Of course, someone will be afraid of you.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
To be honest.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But I don't want to waste my energy.

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Mr. Qin.

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If you're willing to save my energy, I promise you.

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Money.

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll pay you back.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I've let go of your man.

221
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What do you think?

222
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It seems that you don't want to help me.

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Fine.

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I don't want to ask you.

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Just wait.

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll send you the money.

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Wenji.

228
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Lock him up.

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't bother him.

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Wait.

231
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The money of the criminal.

232
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The money of Yan Dieci and me.

233
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't have any.

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The criminal.

235
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You really let him go?

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What if he's lying?

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I dare not bite Yan Dieci.

238
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
According to the future.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yang Song went to Yan Dieci's place to search.

240
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Now he's on his way back.

241
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Keep an eye on him.

242
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
When he comes back, go to catch him.

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes.

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'll take a day off tomorrow.

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
To listen to Xiao Tao Hong's play.

246
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Mr. Chu.

247
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Xiao Tao Hong can't sing tomorrow.

248
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Why?

249
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This is the ceremony of the third wife of the Jiang family.

250
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Xi Yanlin invited Xiao Tao Hong to sing.

251
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You've been with Mr. Qin.

252
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I didn't tell you.

253
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Shen Yurong.

254
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Is he also on the list of the guest singers?

255
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's more interesting than watching the play.

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Husband.

257
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Tell him.

258
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Tell him to dress up quickly.

259
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If he dares to do it, he dares to do it.

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
If he doesn't dare to do it, don't come out.

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes.

262
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Isn't this the famous Danjue Xiao Tao Hong in Beijing?

263
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes.

264
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
His play is very rare.

265
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Today is a blessing.

266
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Mr. Sun.

267
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Mr. Liu.

268
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Please.

269
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Husband.

270
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Today I come to congratulate the third wife.

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's a pleasure.

272
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Thank you.

273
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Husband.

274
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Husband and wife.

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We're late.

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
We're late.

277
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The young master personally gifts the gift.

278
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The little girl will be happy.

279
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I have a marriage agreement with Ruoyao.

280
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Today she is in a hurry.

281
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I must send it to Helin.

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Please.

283
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Madam.

284
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Today is a blessing.

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So lively.

286
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Prime Minister.

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Madam Jiang.

288
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Wait.

289
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Where is the second wife?

290
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I also brought her a gift.

291
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I will accept Madam Liu's heart for Li'er first.

292
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No need.

293
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I will personally give it to her.

294
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This child is suffering.

295
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
She is still a little scared.

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I am also worried that she will be scared here today.

297
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So I let her rest.

298
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Madam Jiang hasn't returned to the capital for a long time.

299
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm afraid she has forgotten the rules she once learned.

300
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
She was difficult to discipline when she was young.

301
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Madam Jiang has lost her mind.

302
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Isn't it?

303
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Someone taught her.

304
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Later, she was abandoned in Zhennv Hall for more than ten years.

305
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let alone the etiquette.

306
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Now it's not easy to come back alive.

307
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Right?

308
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
She forgot the rules and should be punished.

309
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But what about her people?

310
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
How to say?

311
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
As a person, who would be willing to see their own children suffer?

312
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
When my child was gone,

313
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I also felt heartache.

314
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So I let my husband take care of it.

315
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
When I came back to the capital,

316
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I felt heartache.

317
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Madam Liu, don't worry.

318
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Since Li'er is back,

319
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I will make up for it.

320
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You are too kind.

321
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Madam Liu,

322
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Jiang Li was suffering in Zhennv Hall.

323
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
No one would think of her.

324
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But don't forget,

325
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
why did Jiang Li enter Zhennv Hall?

326
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If it wasn't because...

327
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Today is Yao'er's wedding.

328
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Don't mention the past.

329
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Madam Liu.

330
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Madam Liu, this way.

331
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Madam Liu.

332
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You are all here.

333
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Madam Fang.

334
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Madam Liu, we are waiting for you.

335
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Tong.

336
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Tong.

337
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Tong.

338
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Tong.

339
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Damn.

340
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Tong.

341
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Tong.

342
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Tong.

343
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh no

344
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Tong'er

345
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Tong'er

346
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Tong'er

347
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
Wake up

348
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Wake up

349
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,920
Sister, I dreamt someone pinching my face

350
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Wake up

351
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Sister, why are you up so early?

352
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,320
I'm not up early

353
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,520
I've slept

354
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
You've slept?

355
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,320
The ceremony has begun

356
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,320
We can't have slept together

357
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,320
Someone did it

358
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
But sister

359
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
We've avoided it yesterday

360
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
I was careless

361
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
The salt-soup is their secret

362
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,640
Let's leave it here

363
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Hurry up, put on makeup

364
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Yes

365
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,320
Yuanbai, congratulations

366
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Yuezhi

367
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,320
This is a gift from Consort Li

368
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,320
It's a gift from His Majesty

369
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
I don't care about it

370
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
I can only thank her

371
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
You know

372
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
Although she is a concubine now

373
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
She is the family's old friend

374
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
and very close to the family

375
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
In this rite of rites

376
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Consort Li cares about it too

377
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,320
I'm very grateful to you

378
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,320
Your gift is too precious

379
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
I can't accept it

380
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
It's a family

381
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
Shuran

382
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Take it

383
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
Take it

384
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Yes, father

385
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
I'm going to die

386
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
A family is like a family

387
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Have you seen Shuran's cousin?

388
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
Think about it

389
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,320
You should ask His Majesty to give you a suggestion

390
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Yes

391
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Father

392
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Why do you mention it again?

393
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,320
It's good to know that you are a family

394
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
His Majesty follows the rules

395
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,320
How can my husband be a good husband?

396
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
I know it

397
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,320
Today is Ruoyao's wedding

398
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
We can't talk about it

399
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,320
We will discuss it another day

400
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
OK

401
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
I will listen to you

402
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Yuanbai

403
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
I will go in now

404
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Please

405
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
Prime Minister Jiang

406
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Madam

407
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,320
You are welcome

408
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
I told you

409
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
You should come often

410
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,320
You should know Ruoyao

411
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Thank you

412
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
You are the commander of the court

413
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
You are better than my family

414
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
You are better than my family

415
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
They are all different

416
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
I heard that

417
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
They are all above the rank

418
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Tell your brother if you need help

419
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Mother

420
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
No one is young

421
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Old people love people

422
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Come with me

423
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
Go

424
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
It's too much

425
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,320
They sent people to guard it

426
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
I will go now

427
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,320
Go now

428
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
I am joking

429
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
Jiang family is shameless

430
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
You are shameless

431
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
Ji Shuran is so cruel

432
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
What should we do now?

433
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,320
I hope the gift bag I sent out yesterday

434
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,320
will be worth it

435
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,320
Even if Jiang Yuanbai marries you

436
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
he will be so rude to our family

437
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
You are useless

438
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
You have been married for so long

439
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,320
You don't know how to take care of your family

440
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Did you want me to marry him?

441
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Now it's good

442
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
He is so poor

443
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
He wants to kill us all

444
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Don't say that

445
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
Remember

446
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
You are a member of the Ji family

447
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
You should think for the Ji family

448
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
What's wrong with Su Gonggong?

449
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
What's wrong with him?

450
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
What's wrong with him?

451
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
What's wrong with him?

452
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Why is Su Gonggong here?

453
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
He is here to do good

454
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
He is here with a knife

455
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Something big is going to happen

456
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Is Su Gonggong here to kill us?

457
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Is Su Gonggong here to kill us?

458
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Mr. Jiang is joking

459
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Today, there is no official business

460
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Ji Gonggong is so shameless

461
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
The little red-head even gave me the play I made

462
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I will follow him

463
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
and give him a show

464
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
Mr. Jiang will not be displeased

465
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
If so, then I will go

466
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
You are so cruel

467
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
You are so cruel

468
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
You are so cruel

469
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
I will go

470
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
I will go

471
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
I will go

472
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
You are so cruel

473
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
You are so cruel

474
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
You are so cruel

475
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,320
If so, then please go

476
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Where is Mrs. Jiang?

477
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
Mr. Su

478
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Li is not feeling well today

479
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
He is resting in his room

480
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
Mr. Jiang

481
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
My half-sign is for Mrs. Jiang

482
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,320
She should come out

483
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
and thank me for her kindness

484
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
She is really rude

485
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
If so, I will go

486
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
and ask her

487
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,320
Mr. Su, please

488
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
Check it

489
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
Yes

490
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
Good, Ruoyao is in the prime of his life

491
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
He is so famous

492
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
He is so famous

493
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
and he is so talented

494
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
and he is so talented

495
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,320
Mrs. Jiang and Mr. Zhou

496
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,320
are perfect

497
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Today is the day of Ruoyao's ceremony

498
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,320
Thank you for your support

499
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
Thank you

500
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
Thank you

501
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,320
Thank you for your visit

502
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Where is he?

503
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
I have a stomachache

504
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
Where is my father?

505
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,320
We have a family in Jiang's house

506
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,320
We are independent

507
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,320
We are free from the world

508
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,320
We are natural

509
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Yes

510
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,320
He is so handsome

511
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
We found him

512
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
There are two people watching at the door

513
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
I think they can't get out

514
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
I said he is not afraid of the crowd

515
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
He was locked up

516
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,320
Do you want me to go?

517
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
No

518
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Jiang's family is in a mess

519
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
He even wants to come back

520
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
Now we can see

521
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,320
how much Mrs. Jiang wants to show up

522
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,320
It's time

523
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,320
The ceremony begins

524
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
Mrs. Jiang

525
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,320
Thank you

526
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,320
Reporters, please

527
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,320
You are so talented

528
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,320
You are so talented

529
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,320
You are so talented

530
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,320
Next, Mrs. Jiang

531
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,320
Please put on the crown for the reporters

532
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,320
The moon is bright

533
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,320
The family is blessed

534
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,320
The wife and son are childish

535
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,320
The son is good

536
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,320
The wife is good

537
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,320
The son is blessed

538
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:52,320
The ceremony is over

539
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
Thank you

540
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Bravo!

541
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Bravo!

542
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Marquis Yingyuan is really blessed.

543
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
From now on,

544
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,320
there will be another bride in the show.

545
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
It's my blessing.

546
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,320
It's my blessing to marry Ruoyao.

547
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,320
Fire the fireworks!

548
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Where are the fireworks?

549
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
No fireworks.

550
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
They've given away the fireworks.

551
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
Where are the fireworks?

552
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,320
Fireworks...

553
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Master!

554
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,320
Master!

555
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
The fireworks...

556
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,320
They're on fire!

557
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
On fire?

558
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
On fire?

559
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Go and solve it!

560
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,320
What a beautiful flower!

561
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
Isn't it beautiful?

562
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
Who is she?

563
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Why is she so beautiful?

564
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,320
Isn't she the second wife

565
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,320
who just came back from Zhennv Hall?

566
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
So she's the second wife

567
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,320
who killed the emperor's mother.

568
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,320
This...

569
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
This is the second wife.

570
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
Mother,

571
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
Huiran...

572
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Mother.

573
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
It's Concubine Su.

574
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,320
It's her.

575
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,320
It's her, mother.

576
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
Mother, mother.

577
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,320
She's back to die, mother.

578
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
Shut up!

579
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
Third sister.

580
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,320
A little token of my gratitude

581
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,320
to congratulate you on your marriage.

582
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Li'er,

583
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
you're finally here.

584
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
Why are you here so early?

585
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
I'm not familiar with the way to home.

586
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
I'm a little late.

587
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,320
Fortunately,

588
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
I caught up with third sister's momentum.

589
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
Let me introduce to you.

590
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
This is

591
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,320
my second daughter,

592
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,320
Jiang Li, who just came back.

593
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Prime Minister Jiang has adopted a daughter.

594
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Don't mention about

595
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
the mother-in-law killing Li'er.

596
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
She's the second wife.

597
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
She's the second wife.

598
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
She's the second wife.

599
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
She's the second wife.

600
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Mother,

601
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
isn't she the second wife?

602
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
How can there be

603
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
such a perfect person

604
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
in the world?

605
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
She's really

606
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
the daughter of the Prime Minister's family.

607
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
She's been living alone for many years.

608
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
She's still so dignified

609
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
among the nobles.

610
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,320
Prime Minister Jiang is really lucky.

611
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,320
Mrs. Liu, you flatter me.

612
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,320
We're related by blood.

613
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
How can parents not care about their children?

614
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
I know

615
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
that you've been really worried about Li'er.

616
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
That's why I brought Li'er back.

617
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Today, I met the second wife.

618
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
I can't bear to see her.

619
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
You've been away from home for so many years.

620
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
Why haven't I seen your wife?

621
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,320
Who told you that?

622
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
I've been away from home for so many years.

623
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,320
There are many plants in the mountains in Qingcheng.

624
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
Li'er has never been to the capital.

625
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,320
So,

626
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
when Li'er was in the capital,

627
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
Mrs. Jiang

628
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,320
never went to see her.

629
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
She hasn't been to see her for ten years.

630
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,320
Jiang Li is so pitiful.

631
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
She's like a princess.

632
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
She doesn't even have a capital.

633
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
She's too much.

634
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
Mrs. Jiang shouldn't...

635
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,320
Mother has been working hard at home.

636
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,320
If you're tired because of Li'er,

637
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,320
I can't rest easy.

638
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,320
It's not too late today.

639
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
You still have twenty to go.

640
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Here, this chicken.

641
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,320
Chicken gizzards.

642
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
The ancients have their own luck.

643
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,320
Chicken can is a honor for the adults.

644
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,320
Today,

645
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
I'm giving it to you.

646
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,320
It's a compensation for your regret for not having the chicken.

647
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
Here, I'll give you a gizzard.

648
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Thank you for your kindness, Mrs. Liu.

649
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,320
It's just that Li'er

650
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,320
and mother are still in the hall.

651
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
I don't dare to accept your gift.

652
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,320
Why am I confused?

653
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
Is Mrs. Jiang still here?

654
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Come, come, come.

655
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
Mrs. Jiang,

656
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
this hairpin

657
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
is for you.

658
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,320
Li'er,

659
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
I'll give you a hairpin.

660
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Thank you, mother.

661
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
I beg you to take her

662
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
to find my father.

663
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Tell him

664
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
that I'm here

665
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
suffering a lot,

666
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
full of hatred,

667
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,320
but I'm not wrong.

668
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
I've never been wrong.

669
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
I hate him.

670
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,320
I hate every person in the Jiang family.

671
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
Even if I'm underground,

672
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
I have to curse them.

673
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
I can't stand it.

674
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:47,320
Jiang Li, Jiang Li, Jiang Li, Jiang Li.

675
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,320
Mrs. Jiang, you're so lucky.

676
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
The daughter of the head of the family

677
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
is really extraordinary.

678
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Jiang Li, Jiang Li, Jiang Li.

679
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
Your daughter

680
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,320
is really extraordinary.

681
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
Mrs. Jiang,

682
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
I'm so lucky

683
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
to meet your eldest daughter today.

684
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
The daughter of the head of the family

685
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
is at least intelligent.

686
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
The blue mountain is like a honeycomb

687
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
and the white dragon is like a snowy chicken.

688
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
The blue mountain is like a snowy chicken.

689
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,320
The blue mountain is like a snowy chicken.

690
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,320
Jiang Li, Jiang Li, Jiang Li.

691
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
Third Miss.

692
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Ruo Yao.

693
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
Ruo Yao.

694
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
Third Miss.

695
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
Ruo Yao.

696
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Ruo Yao.

697
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Ruo Yao.

698
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,320
What's wrong?

699
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
What's wrong, my lady?

700
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
Ruo Yao.

701
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
Third Miss.

702
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
Ruo Yao.

703
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
My lady.

704
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Ruo Yao.

705
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Li Er, did you see that?

706
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,320
This is the gift I gave you.

707
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,320
Thank you.

708
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,900
I'm sorry for carriage

709
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,320
for your late appearance.

710
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
But I didn't fuckin' give you a friend.

711
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,320
A friend?

712
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,200
I have a friend now.

713
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,320
You have one friend?

714
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Okay.

715
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
Okay, you go ahead.

716
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Thank you.

717
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,320
The sun is setting

718
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,320
I am still in a daze

719
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,320
I want to ask

720
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,320
If I could say a word

721
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,320
If I could tell you

722
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
What should I do?

723
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,320
What should I do?

724
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
I can't do this

725
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
Ruoyang

726
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Young Master

727
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,320
Go, go

728
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
I can't do this

729
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
Go

730
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
Aunt Liu

731
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
Thank you for what happened today

732
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,320
You don't have to thank me

733
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,320
If you need anything, just call me

734
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
Okay

735
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
I am leaving

736
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,320
Why are you so forced by the Liu family?

737
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
Father asked me

738
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
I want to ask you

739
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,320
When can you stop your grudge with the Liu family?

740
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
My daughter is so smart

741
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,320
But she forced me to open a coffin for her

742
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
Okay, okay

743
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
It's not a big deal

744
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,320
But I saw Duke Su was in charge of the coffin

745
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,320
When did he come to the Mansion of Duke Su?

746
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,320
Do you know?

747
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Father, have you forgotten Duke Su's memorial?

748
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Zhenzhen can't stay in the river

749
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,320
Go

750
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
Mrs. Jiang

751
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,320
We meet again

752
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
I am afraid you have forgotten

753
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,320
Last time at the gate

754
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
You

755
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,320
I didn't expect you to be Jiang Li

756
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:36,320
You are better than when we made the engagement

757
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,320
Mr. Zhou

758
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,320
By the way

759
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
This is my small gift

760
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,320
I want to give it to you personally

761
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
I don't want to regret

762
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
Mr. Zhou

763
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,320
The engagement has been fixed

764
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Now I can't accept your gift

765
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
I am sorry

766
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
I am sorry

767
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,320
Now I can't accept your gift

768
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,320
I will give it to the one who should be given

769
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,320
Mr. Zhou, please

770
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,320
Jiang Li looks like Consort Xue

771
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Brother

772
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Is she pregnant?

773
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
Shut up

774
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Today, Ji Lishang

775
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,320
Jiang's family has clearly adopted this daughter

776
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
So she is the daughter of the Prime Minister

777
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,320
It's just a coincidence

778
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,320
If you talk nonsense again

779
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Be careful of the fire

780
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Go

781
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Shen Xue

782
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
Shen Xue

783
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
Who is it, Madam?

784
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
Go

785
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
Madam

786
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,320
What are you looking at?

787
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
I thought I couldn't see this scene

788
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,320
I didn't expect that Jiang's wife has good taste

789
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,320
She knows how to force people to go south

790
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
As for Brother Lin

791
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,320
She knows how to do things in a hurry

792
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
Go

793
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,320
Oh, no

794
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Hit me

795
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,320
Shen Xue, you are done

796
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,320
It's you

797
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
Don't go

798
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,320
Hit me

799
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,320
You can't run away

800
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,320
Come down

801
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,320
You can't run away

802
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,320
Come down

803
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,320
Hit me

804
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,320
Let go

805
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
Don't go

806
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
Why are you coming to Jiang's family?

807
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,320
I don't understand what you are asking

808
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,320
I thought Jiang's family was a good family

809
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
And people were kind

810
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,320
You are so kind to your family

811
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,320
You didn't expect me to be in the family

812
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,320
But you still came back

813
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:59,320
Now it seems that your situation in Jiang's family is just like that

814
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,320
Jiang's family is my home

815
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,320
I have to come back

816
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,320
It's a little too broad

817
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,320
If it's not broad

818
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,320
Can you come back?

819
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,320
Tell me

820
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
How can I repay you?

821
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,320
Thank you for sending me back to the capital

822
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,320
But I also helped you solve the Qingcheng Mountain case

823
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,320
I can also repay you

824
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,320
Now we are even

825
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,320
I won't blame you for wronging me

826
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,320
Please forgive me

827
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,320
Don't blame me

828
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
You reminded me

829
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,320
I am so old

830
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,320
It's the first time someone scolds me for being stupid

831
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
You are so stupid

832
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
Jiang Li

833
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
What should I do with this?

834
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
Then you scold me back

835
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,320
Since you don't scold me

836
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,320
It's over

837
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,320
I will go now

838
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,320
Xue Fangfei

839
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,320
Second lady

840
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Something happened

841
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,320
I will go with you

842
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,320
I am sorry

843
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,320
I am sorry

844
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320

I am sorry

849
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
I am sorry

850
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
I am sorry

851
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,320
I am sorry

852
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,320
I am sorry

853

I am sorry
