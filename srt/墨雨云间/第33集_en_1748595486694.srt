1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't admit it

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain of hiding

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've walked through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Waiting for the spring to return to the earth

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm afraid of you

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're afraid?

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't worry, I won't kill you

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Jiang Xiangguo is still outside

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't want to be caught because of the crime of hurting Xiangguo's daughter

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Jiang Xiangguo

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Jiang Xiangguo

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Jiang Xiangguo

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What do you take me to do?

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't rush, slowly

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Jiang Xiangguo

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Jiang Xiangguo

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Jiang Xiangguo

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Go to the temple and take a look

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Jiang Xiangguo

28
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How is it?

29
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Xuezhao is dead

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's an accident

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I always like to keep my hands on the job

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
To prevent you from getting revenge on me

33
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I've been begging here

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Since it's like this, why don't you say it out loud?

35
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Xue Fangfei

36
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Do you want to save your brother?

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know him

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Do you know him?

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll find out

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Mother

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Mother

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Mother

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Rongjing

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Rongjing

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Stop

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Stop

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Stop

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Tell me

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What do you want me to do?

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Shen Yurong, change Xuezhao

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll let him go when Shen Wendong is back

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If you don't let him go

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What do I do with this man?

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Wait for Xiaoheng to come and check on me

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What right do you have to talk to me about the conditions?

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Since you said the conditions

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Rongjing

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll be there for you

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
From now on

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't touch him

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can do it

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I can do it

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I can do it

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
A'chou

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
A'chou

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
A'chou

68
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Li'er

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Sorry for making you wait for so long

70
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We talked about the plan between the wife and son

71
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's too much

72
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Right?

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes

74
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My dear, come to have tea next time

75
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Li'er

76
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What did the Princess do to you?

77
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's nothing, father

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I had some misunderstandings with the Princess

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But I found it was a misunderstanding

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I didn't have time to explain

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now that she knows I did this

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
She's still thinking of me

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Stop

84
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Stop

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Stop

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Stop

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Stop

88
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let go of her

89
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
A'chou

90
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What's wrong?

91
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Give me a smoke

92
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes

93
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This letter

94
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Send it to the Ninth Housema

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
After she sees it, she'll leave

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
My dear, you're in the Palace of the Princess

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What happened?

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Do you need me to tell Duke Su?

99
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't tell him about this

100
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Master, Zhao Ke said

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
that the Second Lady told him to send a letter to the Ninth Housema

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why did she go to the Ninth Housema?

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Why don't you just take the letter?

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No

106
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I think I like the way you look at people

107
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Zhao Ke said that the Second Lady came out of the Palace of the Princess

108
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and was so confused

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I think the Princess was talking to her

110
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Send someone to look for Wan Ning

111
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Tell me if you have any news about the General

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I've been in the court for years

114
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I never thought that this kind of nonsense

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
would come to my daughter

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The late Shen Fu

117
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
is so blind

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Shen Yurong is not a good person

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He's trying to be a bad person

120
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He's trying to give the crown to his daughter

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Shen Yurong, don't be ashamed

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We all know that the Prime Minister is angry

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The court has issued such a case

124
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We also share it

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But don't worry

126
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I've asked the witnesses of the trial

127
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
They've said the same thing

128
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and the witness has made a point

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
As long as we confirm the evidence of the Second Lady

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Shen Yurong can be punished

131
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Li'er, go

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I want you to tell everyone

134
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
that you're the one who seduced Shen Yurong

135
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You said that you're a new Shen Xun

136
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
While Shen's family is holding a celebration party

137
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
you're like the one who shows your sincerity

138
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and will be angry with you

139
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's why you're hurt

140
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Li'er

141
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This document

142
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I can't sign it

143
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You...

144
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What's the reason?

145
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Because

146
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I've always been a new Shen Xun

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I want to sign it

148
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Jiang Li

149
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Before the Prime Minister

150
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
you must be careful

151
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I want to express my feelings

152
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
with Ye Yan and Shen Xun

153
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and make a misunderstanding

154
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Why didn't you explain it?

155
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It happened suddenly

156
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I was so angry at the trial

157
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I couldn't explain it

158
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I've always been worried about this matter

159
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't want to harm Shen Xun

160
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So today

161
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I came here to return Shen Xun's innocence

162
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Please forgive me

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This matter

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
is what I did

165
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Miss Jiang

166
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't care what you said

167
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'll give you another chance

168
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Think about it

169
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Otherwise

170
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
it won't be a misunderstanding

171
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You said that Shen Yurong was a good person

172
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You hurt Shen Yurong

173
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
to protect yourself

174
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is a case of public confession

175
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You're now a criminal

176
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But in the end

177
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
you're guilty of killing the court

178
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So

179
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
you must think it over

180
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think it over

181
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
This is the truth

182
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm sorry, Jiang Xiangguo

183
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If it's true

184
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
we'll have to change the solution

185
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Today

186
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
it's your fault

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You don't need to be guilty

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll take action

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and make it right

190
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So you can't be

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
involved in this

192
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Li'er

193
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Did Princess Zhan threaten you?

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I threatened you

195
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Tell me

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Or

197
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
what's your concern?

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I just said my crime

199
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll take Shen Xun's innocence

200
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Guards

201
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Take him down

202
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes

203
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Li'er

204
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Li'er

205
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Lord

206
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Jiang Yuanbai took her to the Daris

207
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why?

208
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
She suddenly turned around

209
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and was under arrest

210
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Can you tell me something?

211
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You found a good job

212
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You must save everything

213
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I never let her save me

214
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
She caught my brother

215
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and put him in prison

216
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
She tortured me every day

217
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You don't know

218
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Xuezhao

219
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
She's still alive

220
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Don't pretend to be Shen Yuren

221
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You're so secretive

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
How could she hide it from you?

223
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I really don't know

224
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
She used me to save you

225
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Shen Yuren

226
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You can't just think about it

227
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Remember

228
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Every moment you live

229
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
is the torture I suffer

230
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
In your heart

231
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm such a person

232
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I've trusted you

233
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and gave you a chance

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But you still chose Wanning

235
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm not sure

236
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm not sure

237
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm not sure

238
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm not sure

239
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm not sure

240
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm not sure

241
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm not sure

242
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I chose Wanning

243
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I wish you

244
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
a happy 100 years

245
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm not choosing her

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I just can't abandon mother and sister

247
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Of course I know

248
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Just like you once abandoned me

249
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
My father

250
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and my brother

251
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Right?

252
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I won't have any expectations for you

253
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll finally

254
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
fulfill the evil things you've done

255
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Li

256
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't change me like this again

257
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I feel disgusting this time

258
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm not sure

259
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm not sure

260
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm not sure

261
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm not sure

262
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm not sure

263
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm not sure

264
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm not sure

265
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm not sure

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm not sure

267
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm not sure

268
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm not sure

269
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm not sure

270
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm not sure

271
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm not sure

272
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm not sure

273
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm not sure

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm not sure

275
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm not sure

276
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm not sure

277
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm not sure

278
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm not sure

279
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm not sure

280
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm not sure

281
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm not sure

282
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm not sure

283
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm not sure

284
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm not sure

285
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm not sure

286
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm not sure

287
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm not sure

288
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm not sure

289
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,000
I won't have any expectations for you

290
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I wonder

291
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
When people are iniquated

292
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and when we should learn

293
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,440
how weνο

294
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
polish surf to inspire

295
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What shall we do?

296
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll tell you

297
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I have a favor to ask for.

298
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You're thinking of begging me now?

299
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I only trust you.

300
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What is it?

301
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm going to the Palace Master's Mansion to see my brother.

302
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Xue Zhao is still alive?

303
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But it's not as good as dying.

304
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What will you do after the mortal world is here?

305
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll wait for the return of September.

306
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If it's convenient,

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I can blow up a blow.

308
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Aren't you afraid?

309
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's not the first time.

310
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll go to the Palace Master first to ensure my brother's safety.

311
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's not cute if a little cat cries.

312
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Duke Su, this person is still bothering you to come here personally.

313
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Where is he?

314
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He has been sent to your mansion.

315
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Duke Su, how could I let you and your people see Xue Zhao

316
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and leave here?

317
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I thought you would always hold this card in your hand.

318
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Duke Su, you really don't understand me.

319
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I promise to do what I will.

320
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Besides, the good show just started.

321
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's such a boring thing to kill someone.

322
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
How could I let him be as you wish?

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I want him to see his brother's death personally.

324
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I want him to see his brother's death personally

325
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and become a useless person who can't walk.

326
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's even more heart-warming than killing him directly.

327
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

328
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What do you mean?

329
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He's not as greedy as you are.

330
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He's just living and enough.

331
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

332
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

333
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

334
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

335
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

336
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

337
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

338
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

339
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

340
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Don't change me like this again.

341
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I really feel disgusting this time.

342
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Brother.

343
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,660
.....

344
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I need to deliver dinner for you.

345
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,760
I'll tell the servants to clean up my room that used to exist.

346
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Are you going back to the place?

347
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes, I am.

348
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,500
Wow.

349
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,000
Do you know what previously exist?

350
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,660
I'm sorry for everything on you.

351
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,940
Don't worry.

352
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,220
You look great.

353
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,780
Don't worry

354
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,180
I don't Lake Yi

355
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
I need the water

356
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,780
Zhaixing

357
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,300
Pour water

358
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,740
I have no option

359
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,020
Come

360
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,420
Here

361
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,340
Have a seat

362
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,220
Let's drink

363
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,860
Thank you

364
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
Take it

365
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,140
Come

366
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,180
This

367
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,180
Why don't we take her out first

368
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,180
and put her in the Shen Family?

369
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,180
What do you mean?

370
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,180
I want to invite His Majesty to give marriage to me and Consort Xue.

371
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,180
What did you say?

372
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:42,180
I said I want to invite His Majesty to give marriage to me and Consort Xue.

373
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,180
Have you already thought about it?

374
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,180
You and your Madam Shen should be ahead of each other.

375
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,180
She caused my reputation to be ruined and I'm in debt.

376
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,180
I'm not in debt.

377
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,180
His Highness saved me and gave me a reputation and a future.

378
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,180
I'm not stupid.

379
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,180
How could I want to be ahead of her?

380
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:09,180
If you have Madam Shen, how can you be my father?

381
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,180
His Highness is a humble son.

382
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
If he marries me,

383
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,180
he can be his wife forever.

384
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,180
In this way, he can always serve His Highness.

385
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,180
Your Highness, don't you want to see him down?

386
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Do you hate him so much?

387
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,180
I only hate you now.

388
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,180
What do you mean?

389
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
Stand up and talk.

390
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,180
For His Highness's sake,

391
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,180
I'll give you a hairpin.

392
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,180
Wuxing.

393
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,180
This is the first time you've given me a hairpin.

394
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,180
That's because you have a noble status.

395
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,180
You have already had everything, including me.

396
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:46,180
The Articles Of Love

397
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,180
Theター The Gulander

398
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,480
Par przysz

399
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,180
Types that up their ado.

400
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,180
To let me agree to this marriage,

401
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,180
But it's really a matter of consideration.

402
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,180
The marriage is just a play.

403
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,180
It's all to make you happy.

404
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,180
If the Jiang family doesn't agree,

405
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,180
the emperor won't force them.

406
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,180
So,

407
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,180
we need to change another person to the imperial doctor.

408
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,180
Who?

409
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,180
Consort Li.

410
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:35,180
The Emperor's Residence

411
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,180
This is a play on the scene.

412
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,180
How is the mountain?

413
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,180
The wound is weak, but it's still not healed.

414
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,180
The immortal spirit is now sleeping.

415
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,180
How is his leg?

416
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,180
Is it cured?

417
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
The doctor said

418
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,180
he would be a ghost in the future.

419
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,180
Have you got the investigation done?

420
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,180
Is there any problem?

421
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,180
No.

422
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,180
He is always so stubborn.

423
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,180
The imperial doctor has already decided to kill the imperial doctor.

424
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,180
He has to take the first step.

425
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,180
What is the reaction?

426
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,180
The detective heard that the minister of the imperial doctor went to find the emperor.

427
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,180
But the emperor gave him the Zhao of Zhou.

428
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,180
So the minister of the imperial doctor is now in the palace.

429
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,180
It seems that the emperor is going to close the door.

430
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,180
Prepare the carriage.

431
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,180
Your Highness.

432
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,180
The princess of the imperial doctor is here.

433
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,180
Consort Li.

434
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,180
The princess of the imperial doctor came to visit me.

435
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,180
It's rare.

436
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,180
I came late.

437
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,180
When Mrs. Jiang was in trouble,

438
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,180
she came to visit me.

439
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,180
She was so busy.

440
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,180
I came late.

441
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,180
When Mrs. Jiang was in trouble,

442
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,180
I should come and ask her.

443
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,180
The princess of the imperial doctor came today.

444
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,180
She must have been in trouble.

445
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,180
If my sister were not killed by you,

446
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,180
she wouldn't have been so bad.

447
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,180
Even if I don't cooperate with her,

448
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,180
she and Jiang Li have another moment.

449
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,180
She can't fight with Jiang Li.

450
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,180
Jiang Li killed Mrs. Jiang.

451
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,180
What's the use of saying these now?

452
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,180
I have a way.

453
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,180
I can vent my anger for your sister.

454
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,180
I'll see if you're willing to do it.

455
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,180
Tell me.

456
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,180
Let His Majesty get married.

457
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,180
Jiang Li and Shen Yurong get married?

458
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,180
What does that mean?

459
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,180
Zhong Shulin is his daughter Ruo Zhenbao.

460
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
We can't move her

461
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,180
while the Jiang family is protecting her.

462
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
But Shen Yurong is my wife.

463
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
If she comes to the Shen family,

464
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
we'll be in trouble.

465
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,180
It sounds like a good idea.

466
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,180
But I won't be

467
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,180
a gunman like my sister.

468
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,180
How can I be a gunman?

469
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,180
I'm just a threat to you.

470
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,180
What?

471
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,180
I heard that

472
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,180
the harem has been damaged.

473
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,180
The harem is going to the prison.

474
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,180
What's wrong with Consort Xian?

475
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,180
She's gone.

476
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,180
Except for the harem,

477
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,180
the harem is involved in this.

478
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,180
They're all involved in this.

479
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,180
It's strange.

480
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,180
Where have they gone?

481
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,180
Consort Li knows

482
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,180
I know.

483
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,180
I have to thank you.

484
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,180
If it weren't for you,

485
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,180
I wouldn't have thought

486
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,180
that you're a criminal.

487
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,180
You even hurt my sister

488
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,180
to go to the heaven and earth.

489
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,180
Do you think I'll betray you?

490
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,180
You didn't want to kill me.

491
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,180
But now you're late.

492
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,180
You let a maid know

493
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,180
that she's gone.

494
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:37,180
I found her.

495
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,180
If I use some tricks on her,

496
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,180
she'll tell His Majesty

497
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,180
everything she did.

498
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,180
You just let His Majesty

499
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,180
give her a marriage.

500
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,180
You forced her to explain

501
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,180
why Consort Xian was going to kill her.

502
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,180
It's easy for her to do that.

503
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,180
It's done.

504
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,180
I'll give her the maid

505
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,180
and punish her.

506
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,180
Why are you still standing there?

507
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,180
Come and have tea.

508
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,180
His Majesty doesn't care about Jiang Li?

509
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,180
Do you really think

510
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,180
I can even do this?

511
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,180
What if there's a trap?

512
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,180
I said before

513
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,180
you should take good care of your wife.

514
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,180
What do you want to do with your wife?

515
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,180
What?

516
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,180
Didn't they make a move?

517
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,180
They did.

518
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,180
Xiao Heng,

519
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,180
you're being too caring.

520
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,180
Your Majesty,

521
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,180
Consort Li invited you to the Imperial Garden.

522
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,180
I should take a break.

523
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,180
You can go back.

524
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,180
I think you're more

525
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,180
capable of being a wife than you.

526
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,180
Yes.

527
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,180
The shrine is open.

528
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,180
Keep an eye.

529
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,180
Be ready to inform me soon.

530
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

531
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,180
Our business hasn't calmed down

532
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,180
for long.

533
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,180
It's all my fault.

534
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,180
It was late to handle

535
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,180
There's a lot of trouble behind the alliance.

536
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,700
Is His Majesty only talking about

537
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,860
the matter between the second wife and Shen Xue?

538
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,660
Their matter is very well-read.

539
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,460
Shen Jiang and the two families seem to be making a lot of trouble.

540
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,660
Shen Xue and Zhong Shuli are all the ministers of the court.

541
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,660
It's my first and last time.

542
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,260
It's hard for me too.

543
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,660
I have an idea.

544
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,980
I can solve His Majesty's problems

545
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,460
and make both of them satisfied.

546
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,420
Oh?

547
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,940
After all, Li Er is my sister's daughter.

548
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,980
Although they have a lot of misunderstandings between the two of them,

549
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,940
I have always regarded Li Er as my niece.

550
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,820
You see, a good wife

551
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,100
is in jail.

552
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,980
She has no dignity or dignity.

553
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,500
I feel sorry for her.

554
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,220
I sent someone to ask about Shen Xue's origin.

555
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,020
I didn't expect it to be a misunderstanding.

556
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,180
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

557
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,420
What kind of misunderstanding do I have?

558
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,900
I sent someone to ask Shen Xue's origin.

559
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,100
Why don't you let him explain to His Majesty in person?

560
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,100
That's good.

561
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,620
I've seen His Majesty.

562
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,180
I've seen Consort Li.

563
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,700
I heard Consort Li say you and Jiang Li had a misunderstanding.

564
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,540
It's my fault.

565
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,140
After all, the name of the wife is more important.

566
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,420
I believe that you are just a fool.

567
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,500
You don't have to be so considerate.

568
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,900
I'd like to ask His Majesty to bless her.

569
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,900
Don't pursue her anymore.

570
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,460
Are you really not interested in this?

571
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,700
I won't argue with you.

572
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,780
Shen Xue is a gentleman.

573
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,180
She has a wide range of talents.

574
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,580
She is not a good match.

575
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,380
This matter is definitely a loss to Li'er's reputation.

576
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,220
She made a mistake.

577
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,860
I'm afraid she's getting a good person in the south.

578
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:34,020
She said that she was in love with Shen Xue before.

579
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,220
Since Shen Xue doesn't care about her,

580
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,060
Your Majesty, why don't you two give each other a chance

581
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,900
to balance this matter and keep Li'er's reputation?

582
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,940
In that case, you must be too wronged about Shen Qing.

583
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,540
If we can keep the reputation of Lady Jiang'er alive,

584
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,180
I'd like to hear what Consort Li said.

585
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,620
Marriage is a big deal.

586
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,260
I have to ask the Chancellor of the Central Academy.

587
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,660
But Shen Qing promised to keep it a secret.

588
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,380
He sent a letter to the Court of Judicial Review.

589
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,100
Release Jiang Li and let Jiang family take care of her.

590
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,300
Yes.

591
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,340
Leave the Chancellor to me.

592
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,660
If both families have a will,

593
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:33,380
I'm willing to take the opportunity to make a good marriage.

594
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,260
Okay, I'll do as you say.

595
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,580
I'm willing to send a letter to the Imperial Court.

596
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,460
I'll let Lady Jiang'er come out.

597
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,140
You can go.

598
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,740
They want to have a marriage with His Majesty.

599
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,300
So this is what they want to do.

600
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,340
Director, shall we return to the palace or go to prison?

601
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,940
Go to prison directly.

602
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,300
Yes.

603
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,900
Lady Jiang'er, you may leave.

604
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,900
I'll send her out.

605
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,660
Yes, Senior Shen.

606
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,300
I've been wronged a few days.

607
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,980
Will you marry me?

608
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,740
I don't want to.

609
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,660
I don't want to.

610
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,260
I don't want to.

611
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,340
I don't want to marry you.

612
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,580
I don't want to marry you.

613
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,980
I don't want to marry you.

614
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,900
I don't want to.

615
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,980
Okay.

616
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:57,620
Okay, I'll leave after you acknowledge your decision.

617
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,140
You're crazy?

618
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,500
I didn't know that you'd be released.

619
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,620
His Majesty is going to pounds our marriage for you.

620
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
With love between us,

621
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,620
what you've done won't be blame for it.

622
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,620
Is this how you planned

623
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,140
So you married me once,

624
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,820
killed me once.

625
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,340
Are you going to kill me again

626
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,860
the second time?

627
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,460
If I say

628
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,100
this time is to protect you,

629
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,380
do you believe it?

630
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,660
I do.

631
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
But I feel disgusting when I hear it.

632
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,220
As aずqia sedancar driver

633
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,140
it will pay for the resize.

634
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,460
Leave him alone.

635
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,980
A'Li.

636
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,820
You don't believe me.

637
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,620
But the law of interactions is worth it.

638
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,380
Let me deliver this to you.

639
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,140
Think of my words.

640
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,300
You Тыe're looking for way back.

641
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,700
I dare not do it.

642
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,300
If you insist on leaving,

643
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,000
I'll see them off.

644
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,720
Look.

645
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:08,560
Well.

646
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,080
Whoever sent this,

647
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,000
lies deep here.

648
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,500
Today...

649
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,100
I must send your reply.

650
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:13,800
Here.

651
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:14,900
Here.

652
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,220
Your Highness!

653
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,200
You're at乳先.

654
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,960
Right now.

655
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:22,800
Please take care.

656
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,300
Yes.

657
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,440
Tell Master Yu about this!

658
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,520
It's all right now.

659
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,340
Let's stay here and discuss what's right now.

660
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:32,960
Where are you?

661
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,360
Just negotiation.

662
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,780
Someone wants to talk to you about it.

663
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,700
Go and talk with him.

664
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,580
Go over there.

665
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,040
Then we can talk with him

666
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,020
suitable for your family

667
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,740
It's your wish

668
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,060
But what is punishment?

669
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,740
I admit

670
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,260
let me spend my toilet time

671
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,080
I will stay all night

672
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,680
We are now at famous fruit market dealing world husbandry.

673
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,700
When you come to league,

674
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,120
I will fool you and drag you in.

675
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,180
How dare you ignore her!

676
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,780
You are boasting so deep in the börjar!

677
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,780
How can you imagine if she is big b공?

678
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,640
I don't worth it.

679
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,380
My mother is writing a marriage agreement.

680
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,420
Not that she is the boasting machine.

681
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,880
She calls every types of�inch dzeng тогдаy.

682
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,220
Is she the one Norway塊 is in?

683
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,220
I've sent someone to search for you.

684
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,220
Li Fei should know about Wan Ning's danger.

685
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:43,620
A part of the reason why the former technical director of the island was Wan Ning's失利

686
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,620
is that now Li Fei is willing to help Wan Ning.

687
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,220
There must be a danger.

688
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,820
Don't think too much. Wait for the news.

689
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,420
I'll send you to the State Department to see your brother first.

690
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,620
By the way, you're also going to prepare a set of words to go back to Jiangjia.

691
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,420
Sister.

692
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,820
Zhao.

693
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,220
Sister.

694
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,220
Everyone outside said that you're dead.

695
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,220
I thought that you're dead too.

696
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,820
And father.

697
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,620
Did you see father?

698
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,220
Father?

699
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,820
Father?

700
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,220
Father?

701
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,620
Father?

702
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,820
Did you see father? Did he know about us?

703
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,420
I know.

704
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,420
You're very good.

705
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,220
What about the gold mine in Dongshan? Is it still open?

706
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,820
No.

707
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,020
No, Zhao.

708
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,620
You did very well.

709
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,620
You drew a lot of people.

710
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,020
That's good.

711
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,420
Sister, I still want to ask you.

712
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,620
All right.

713
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,020
You should rest well first.

714
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,820
I'll tell you everything in the future.

715
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,620
Okay?

716
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,420
Zhao.

717
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,620
I'm no longer Xue Fang Fei.

718
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,820
I have a new identity.

719
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,420
I'm Jiang Yuan Bai's daughter.

720
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,020
Jiang Li.

721
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,820
Jiang Li?

722
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,220
Sister.

723
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,220
I didn't expect you to suffer so much.

724
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,420
It's all over.

725
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,220
You and father are still alive.

726
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,620
It's my happiest thing.

727
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,220
But you...

728
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,220
I heard that you were killed by the bandits.

729
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,420
I received a letter that day.

730
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,220
I didn't want father to worry.

731
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,220
I just wanted to kill him.

732
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,820
I wanted to go to the capital to talk about the money.

733
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,620
I think this is strange.

734
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:04,020
I was so anxious to report to the imperial court.

735
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,220
I didn't expect to meet a traitor on the way.

736
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,820
Who is hiding here?

737
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,820
Get out of here!

738
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,120
Y!!!

739
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,120
Why do you run intoulos?

740
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,120
I'll kill you!

741
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,820
Get out of here!

742
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,920
Get out of here!

743
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,720
Great Westernisión, negotiation has failed.

744
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,360
Add consciousness!

745
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,980
Hurry!

746
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,280
Great Western hand,

747
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,920
kill theesehen,

748
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,640
and then you'll have the throne.

749
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,080
I haven't seen you for a long time.

750
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,400
I'm also in the capital.

751
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,960
It seems that Heaven

752
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,960
has left us a way to live.

753
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,120
Sister,

754
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,080
everyone says that we are in a difficult situation.

755
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,480
We have suffered a lot.

756
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,360
The future is a good day.

757
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,280
You should recuperate.

758
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,880
If you need anything,

759
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,280
send someone to Jiangzhai to find me.

760
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,480
I have to go back and deal with some things.

761
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:35,960
Okay.

762
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:42,800
painters

763
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,040
You think of Esther later?

764
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,440
I spill it somewhere.

765
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,120
We don't know who this is.

766
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:51,920
OK.

767
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:03,840
Just worry about me out of the blue,

768
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
I just stay here.

769
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,800
I'm sorry.

770
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
I was thinking of pulling a hole.

771
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,840
It was the Duke of Su who came to pick me up.

772
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,880
He asked me about the details of the case.

773
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,720
He delayed some time.

774
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,840
Why did Duke of Su suddenly take this matter?

775
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,160
It's probably related to the eldest princess.

776
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,320
So I came to check.

777
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,480
I know you have a relationship with Duke of Su.

778
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,760
Since you trust him, I won't say much.

779
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
But when you were in the dark,

780
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,120
you were caught by Wan Ning by him.

781
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,720
I know you don't trust me

782
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,200
because of the past.

783
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,400
But we are both women.

784
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,800
If you come to me,

785
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,800
I will hold you in my arms

786
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,200
even if you fall down.

787
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,840
This matter suddenly made my father feel guilty.

788
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,080
I thought he would blame me.

789
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,600
I know your character for the first time.

790
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,720
Your child seems to be a devil.

791
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,960
It's actually your own reason.

792
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,360
Since I decided to come back to help you,

793
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,120
I decided to trust you.

794
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,600
If you want to explain, explain.

795
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,920
If you don't want to explain, tell me.

796
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,400
I can do anything for you.

797
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,120
Father,

798
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,920
now the matter between me and the eldest princess is solved.

799
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,000
Please don't bother to worry about it.

800
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,640
But there is something more important.

801
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,480
What is it?

802
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,800
Your Majesty wants to get married with Shen Yurong.

803
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,240
When?

804
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,040
I heard Shen Yurong say it in prison.

805
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,800
What do you think?

806
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,160
I don't want to.

807
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,640
But when he gets married,

808
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,800
he is already in the right place.

809
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,880
But he hasn't made any decree.

810
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,240
The matter is already settled for Consort Li.

811
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,760
It's not his intention to get married.

812
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,200
He suddenly got involved in this.

813
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,760
He is afraid it's not a good idea.

814
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,360
Your Majesty is getting married.

815
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,760
It's a matter of the royal family.

816
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,080
From the time I was in the court,

817
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,240
I have never refused to get married.

818
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,280
I was the one who got married.

819
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,360
I took the first place of Shen Yurong.

820
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,360
If father refused to get married,

821
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,280
Consort Li would be so arrogant.

822
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,280
She would be so proud of her.

823
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,400
Is mother all right now?

824
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,000
Other than eating and drinking, she is not in love.

825
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,120
Now I need to see Consort Li and mother.

826
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,240
With the way she is now,

827
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,040
I'm afraid she won't be able to understand Consort Li.

828
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,320
Try it first.

829
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,800
And ask father to arrange it.

830
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,160
It's not a problem.

831
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,640
Lord, I found out what you wanted.

832
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,520
The scout said when he heard Wanning and Consort Li meet,

833
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,840
he said that the evil incident happened in the palace.

834
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,840
The death of Consort Xian?

835
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,040
Yes.

836
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,320
The scout found out again.

837
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,240
I'm afraid it's a big surprise.

838
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,560
Is there any evidence?

839
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,040
He is still investigating the palace maid who was released.

840
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,320
Does anyone know?

841
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,280
Since Wanning has found Consort Li,

842
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,560
I think she has already found the witness.

843
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,120
You can find out from her.

844
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,600
Do you want to tell His Majesty about this?

845
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,800
No need.

846
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,800
His Majesty may not understand.

847
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,520
Then we need to secretly investigate this.

848
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,120
I'm afraid the time is short.

849
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,120
I'm afraid that when the investigation is done,

850
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,440
Consort Li will be married to her.

851
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,560
I'll go and investigate it now.

852
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
Tell Ah Li about this.

853
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,760
Yes.

854
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,600
My love, I'm sorry.

855
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,720
I'm sorry.

856
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,840
I'm sorry.

857
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,880
I'm sorry.

858
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,000
I'm sorry.

859
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,960
I'm sorry.

860
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,160
I'm sorry.

861
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,120
I'm sorry.

862
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,160
I'm sorry.

863
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,360
I'm sorry.

864
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,240
I'm sorry.

865
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,280
I'm sorry.

866
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,320
I'm sorry.

867
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,520
I'm sorry.

868
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,720
I'm sorry.

869
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,920
I'm sorry.

870
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,120
I'm sorry.

871
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,320
I'm sorry.

872
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,360
I'm sorry.

873
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,560
I'm sorry.

874
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,680
I'm sorry.

875
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,800
I'm sorry.

876
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,920
I'm sorry.

877
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,120
I'm sorry.

878
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,320
I'm sorry.

879
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,840
I'm sorry.

880
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,040
I'm sorry.

881
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,240
I'm sorry.

882
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,440
I'm sorry.

883
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,720
I'm sorry.

884
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,840
I'm sorry.

885
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,280
I'm sorry.

886
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,480
I'm sorry.

887
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,840
I'm sorry.

888
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,040
I'm sorry.

889
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,240
I'm sorry.

890
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,600
I'm sorry.

891
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,640
I'm sorry.

892
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,000
I'm sorry.

893
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,280
I'm sorry.

894
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,480
I'm sorry.

895
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,680
I'm sorry.

896
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,120
I'm sorry.

897
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,400
I'm sorry.

898
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,920
I'm sorry.

899
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,200
I'm sorry.

900
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,480
I'm sorry.

901
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,920
I'm sorry.

902
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,480
Popまでは

903
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:08,360
It's fine, I can continue.

904
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,280
But I'm fine.

905
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,000
Are you good?

906
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:22,280
I'm always injured, but I'm still DOT?

907
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,280
All the courage

908
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,280
Love

909
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:34,280
Love until you breathe

910
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,280
The process of passing through life

911
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,280
Only for you

912
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,280
After the cup

913
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,280
I won't stay far away

914
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,280
After the cup

915
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:57,280
I won't stay far away
