1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't know

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain of hiding

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Waiting for the spring to return to the earth

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 3

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll show you how to make your own medicine

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Look, this is the most suitable medicine for you

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Then you should go to the pharmacy

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The woman who used it is in my house

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Inform the security

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Go

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You dare to come?

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Go

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Xiaoke

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How are you?

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What happened?

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't know what happened

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A woman named Jioyue came to my house with the guards of the Palace

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
She said she wanted to cure Xue Xianling

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But I didn't know where she was

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
She wanted to assassinate that woman

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It was so sudden

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
How is Xue Xianling?

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
She took her here

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The Palace said she's not safe

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
She's in her house

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Did they get hurt?

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How about you?

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Are you okay?

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm fine

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's just that woman named Jioyue seems to be badly injured

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll go and see her

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Duke Su

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Are you okay?

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm fine

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How is Jioyue?

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
She's fine

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
She's fine now

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She's still asleep

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
She'll be fine in a few days

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Alright

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Ninth Water Tennessee Bridge

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
ourWho we only here

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
to protect you

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
on this moment

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,740
My daughter

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Could I say something?

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You'll be my psychologist

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,520
to the Great Zhao and Great Yan?

59
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,200
Yes.

60
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
In September,

61
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,720
it was the time for Xue Xianlin to get sick.

62
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,800
That's when others had the chance to do it.

63
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,840
He didn't meet me all day.

64
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,480
I didn't feel at ease all day.

65
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,920
When he recovers,

66
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,040
I come to visit him every day.

67
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,720
Really?

68
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,760
What?

69
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,840
You said you

70
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,040
would come here every day.

71
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,040
Wait.

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,480
What's wrong?

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,440
I have some clothes.

74
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,920
Let's go.

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,200
Brother Xiaoyu.

76
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's go.

77
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,240
Let's go.

78
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

79
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,840
No.

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
No.

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,960
I haven't seen anyone.

82
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,720
Take them all.

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,200
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

84
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,360
No.

85
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,800
Where are you?

86
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,360
Have you seen this person?

87
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,200
He's so tall.

88
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,680
Think about it.

89
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,680
So beautiful.

90
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,200
Master.

91
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,120
All the positions are under the watch.

92
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,240
We haven't found the master.

93
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,040
Keep searching.

94
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,560
The bodyguard in the city

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,680
can't escape.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,560
Now the master is in the house.

97
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,640
It seems that

98
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,800
the only hiding place

99
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,840
is Li's house.

100
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,960
He won't hide the person

101
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,160
in his house.

102
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,200
We just need to search the town.

103
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,240
Yes.

104
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,600
Where's the food?

105
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,080
Is he still here?

106
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,120
Yes.

107
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,520
Master Du's family

108
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,760
is in a serious condition.

109
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,960
He's in a hurry to go back.

110
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,040
Before you leave,

111
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,200
he'll write the situation in his heart.

112
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,120
I'll give it to you.

113
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,120
Since I don't care about the people I order,

114
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
I'll be honest with you.

115
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,560
Whoever is sitting here

116
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,680
will meet with Second Madam Jiang

117
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,920
in front of His Majesty.

118
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,440
What's going on?

119
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,000
Forget it.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What's going on?

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What's going on?

122
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
What's going on?

123
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
What's going on?

124
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,760
I don't want to go.

125
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,560
Go.

126
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,800
Before we go home today,

127
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,600
if no one is willing to go,

128
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,440
I'll sign the paper.

129
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,440
Sign the paper?

130
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,240
What's going on?

131
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
What's going on?

132
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,040
What's going on?

133
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
What's going on?

134
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,080
Why are you looking at me?

135
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,640
You...

136
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,800
Whoever you go,

137
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,840
I'll go anyway.

138
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,960
Master Du

139
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,400
has been hiding in the capital

140
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,320
and he's been looking for you.

141
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
We don't have enough money

142
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,960
to buy the paper.

143
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,480
It's not appropriate for me

144
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,840
to say that I'm a genius.

145
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
I'm not suitable for it.

146
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,040
People who are from Jiangli

147
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,440
are not good at breaking the rules

148
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,240
and dare to bring the people

149
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,840
to the top of the high-level.

150
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,240
This is the genius.

151
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,840
You're playing the whole Hanlin Garden

152
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
and Shen Xueshi is not good enough.

153
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,640
Yes.

154
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,440
Why isn't Shen Xueshi participating?

155
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,240
He knows

156
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,840
that we dare not talk to Jiangli.

157
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,240
Is it...

158
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Is it...

159
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Didn't you hear that?

160
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,280
Jiangli and Shen Xueshi's

161
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,840
Wang Qi

162
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,440
look alike.

163
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,240
I'm not afraid of

164
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,640
loving Jiangli, right?

165
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Maybe he already loves her.

166
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
If he's so greedy,

167
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,640
he can't help but to make himself

168
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
stay away from her.

169
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
That's right.

170
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,440
That's right.

171
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,040
Yes.

172
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,240
That's right.

173
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
What are you talking about?

174
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,440
That's right.

175
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,640
The dishes are so delicious.

176
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
Yes.

177
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Look.

178
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,840
It's so strange.

179
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,240
These are all my favorite dishes.

180
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,240
You know me?

181
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
You can make such a big dish.

182
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,840
What do you want me to do?

183
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,040
Hard work and tired work?

184
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,440
If you're not tired,

185
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
you just need to act.

186
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
What?

187
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
In order to perform in the Dream World,

188
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,040
I spent a lot of time

189
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
for our Jiang Family's glory.

190
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Tomorrow is the time to take the throne.

191
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,440
Take the throne?

192
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,240
I will ask Shen Xueshi to resign from the Dream World.

193
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,640
You want to perform again?

194
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,840
You want to resign?

195
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
You've made a mess.

196
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,640
You want to resign?

197
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,040
If I resign,

198
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,240
Shen Xueshi will find

199
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,840
the Jiang Family to ask about the situation.

200
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,440
He will even be a guest.

201
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,640
That Jiang Family is me?

202
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,840
Then?

203
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,440
Use your three-inch snake

204
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,040
to make him come to Jiang Family to find me.

205
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,440
It's over.

206
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
It's over?

207
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,240
Then, after a long time,

208
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,440
you want me to act on my own?

209
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,640
Don't think that

210
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,840
you let him come to Jiang Family.

211
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,040
He will be here.

212
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,440
Jiang Li, Jiang Li.

213
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,640
I admire your eyes.

214
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,840
You said that

215
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,440
you want to find Liu Xu and Ye Shijie.

216
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,640
They are absolutely half of them.

217
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,240
But you found me.

218
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,440
You're like God.

219
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,840
He gave you a new way to get a job.

220
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,240
God is kind to you.

221
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
He doesn't even say that.

222
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,040
But I can't stand it anymore.

223
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,640
Why do people like Duke Su

224
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,040
like to watch you act?

225
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,240
You clearly have a idea of the East.

226
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,240
But you told everyone that you want to go west.

227
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,040
You clearly made up so many different ideas.

228
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,440
But you have a desire to let people see it.

229
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,240
I just want to know

230
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,440
what your idea of the East is.

231
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,240
This is the so-called

232
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,640
suspense.

233
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,240
It's more delicious

234
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,040
if you don't say it out loud.

235
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,440
All right.

236
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
You really came?

237
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,040
Shen Xueshi.

238
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,640
Shen Xueshi.

239
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,240
Why do you have time?

240
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
Let's see how everyone is doing.

241
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,040
It's the critical time now.

242
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Everyone must be careful.

243
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
If anything is inconvenient,

244
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,640
you must inform me in advance.

245
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,040
Yes.

246
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
I will go to the West.

247
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
Yes.

248
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Is there anything wrong today?

249
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Other than the trial, he has something to do.

250
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
He has entered the palace.

251
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,440
I heard from the trial.

252
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,040
You all came here early today.

253
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
You never told us.

254
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,640
It's worth your time.

255
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Thank you, Shen Xueshi.

256
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,040
You are all busy.

257
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,640
What should we do?

258
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,440
Selling apples.

259
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,640
Jing Rui.

260
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,640
Fourth Brother Liujiu and Stateary Liu Shuyu.

261
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,640
You know who she is.

262
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,840
I know.

263
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,040
What happened?

264
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
How about

265
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,840
telling them we will meet together?

266
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,800
So she's sick.

267
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,280
She's injured in the previous generation.

268
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,600
She's sick because of this.

269
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,320
Do you know how Jiang Li is now?

270
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,040
He has a face like your wife.

271
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,080
So he's trying to put her on you.

272
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,960
Shen Xue is trying to hide because of money.

273
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,800
Who said that?

274
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,840
Nonsense.

275
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,600
Shen Xue is a famous figure.

276
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,480
He's not stubborn.

277
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,520
But these rumors

278
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,880
are like a woman who has a business.

279
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,040
If I were Jiang Li,

280
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,480
I wouldn't have died.

281
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,520
As her brother,

282
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,360
you should persuade her to stop

283
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,280
these rumors.

284
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,920
You're too harsh on me.

285
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,760
How can I persuade her?

286
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,480
I can't do anything.

287
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Or I wouldn't be here.

288
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,280
If you delay the generation of the Shi,

289
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,240
the punishment will be the Jiang family.

290
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,600
What should we do?

291
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,600
Uncle and aunt are still traveling.

292
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,320
Uncle and aunt are stupid.

293
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,600
Aunt and aunt are old.

294
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,560
No one can persuade her.

295
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,200
But...

296
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,960
I often mention Shen Xue's good news

297
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,040
in Jiang Li.

298
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,240
Or Shen Xue

299
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,040
will help me persuade her.

300
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,160
Yes.

301
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,120
Shen Xue,

302
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,560
you need to get rid of the spirit.

303
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,000
She's in a bad mood.

304
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,000
She doesn't want to see anyone.

305
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,640
I know she's annoying me.

306
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,520
I'm not going.

307
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,080
Bai Xue.

308
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,640
Please bring Shen Xue in.

309
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,880
Well...

310
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,760
It's not appropriate.

311
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,840
Shen Xue is

312
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,560
a man who's saved his life

313
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,640
and has seven levels of fortune.

314
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
As her brother,

315
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,920
I really...

316
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,240
Please.

317
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,160
I want to live in peace with her

318
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,240
until the end of time.

319
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,200
Alright.

320
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,960
We'll leave it to you.

321
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,080
Ok.

322
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,120
That's all.

323
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,720
Ok.

324
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:30,880
It's fine.

325
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,580
Did dying Prince

326
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,280
have ever been in prison like me?

327
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,540
Let's think of it as a misunderstanding about Miss Rascal.

328
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,380
Exactly.

329
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,600
In fact,

330
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,020
you should think few details of what happened to me.

331
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,540
Your Highness,

332
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,740
how can you think of this so stably?

333
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,780
and the family of the Huoji family.

334
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,700
Shen Xueshi.

335
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,140
Take away the words of the crown prince.

336
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,580
You really don't know

337
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,140
where Liu Yan is from.

338
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,540
From the beginning of your non-proliferation,

339
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,100
you threw me to the Moon Palace first.

340
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,860
And then you died in front of His Majesty.

341
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,580
Even if I had the chance to share the words with Han Ling,

342
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,340
you kept asking for my husband's words

343
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,340
to make me feel bad.

344
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,540
If I didn't have the same look as you,

345
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,220
would you still treat me like that?

346
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,580
Miss Jiang Er,

347
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,860
it's none of your business.

348
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,860
Since that's the case,

349
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,020
why don't we

350
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,540
share the words with each other?

351
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,660
What did you say?

352
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,820
The best way to break the rumors

353
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,100
is to face them.

354
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,380
If you say

355
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,100
everything has nothing to do with my appearance,

356
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,740
then our share of words

357
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,180
is the best proof.

358
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,820
It proves that Shen Xueshi

359
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,460
can be separated from Wang Qi and Jiang Li.

360
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,020
It proves that you didn't

361
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,140
deliberately avoid me.

362
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
It proves that you are heartless.

363
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,260
Shen Xueshi is still afraid.

364
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,500
I'm curious

365
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,420
if Shen Xueshi

366
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,340
is in love

367
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,340
or hatred?

368
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,540
I'm sure it's hatred.

369
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,340
Because I look like her,

370
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,900
you transferred your hatred

371
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,180
to me.

372
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,620
So you're avoiding me everywhere.

373
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,820
You're not the same as what people say.

374
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,060
You're the fairy.

375
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,420
You hate her.

376
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,460
Say it!

377
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,460
Sorry, Shen Xueshi.

378
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,900
Shen Xueshi.

379
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,060
I must have been hurt by the rumors

380
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,700
and that's why I asked you this.

381
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,060
I was wrong.

382
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,820
I'm going back to my room.

383
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,660
I love her.

384
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,500
I love Shen Xueshi.

385
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,000
Admit what?

386
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,860
I love him

387
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,940
You must be pleased to hear that

388
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,280
your husband killed you

389
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,240
I come to Hanlinguang to see you turn out to be顆

390
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,300
in every time

391
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,920
I'm on your side

392
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,260
Return.

393
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,260
Take a look at your smile.

394
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,700
In your passed somn Olympics.

395
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,140
What a jump,

396
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,180
reminds me something!

397
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,460
Did you hide Chu Lan well?

398
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,380
Don't worry, dad.

399
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,620
I already set up an�fmoye.

400
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,900
There are dead bodies there.

401
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,420
The people who were killed couldn't get in.

402
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,220
The royal stone of the Imperial City, Yuan Jiang,

403
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,900
was stolen by me by a new bloodstain in Lalu Island.

404
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,100
Don't give me any chance.

405
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,700
Don't worry, Father.

406
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,100
Yuan Jiang just surrendered.

407
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,700
This is the opportunity for me to test their loyalty.

408
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,340
Jing'er, you must be careful too.

409
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Yes.

410
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,660
Ling market

411
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,260
You OK?

412
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,940
Did you think he looked wag talky?

413
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,140
He was on my attention.

414
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,980
I'm not just crazy,

415
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,860
until I can save your life.

416
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,180
I'll go and check on him.

417
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,000
Alright, I will do it.

418
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,140
Yi Li.

419
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,620
You leave me alone.

420
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,660
I will have you killed just now.

421
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,940
Chief, enough is enough.

422
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,580
Stand by 這我來我來,

423
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,560
Chief還有一塊飯。

424
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,660
啊,我來風茶餵桌啊

425
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,660
I'll send it to the Ninth Lord.

426
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,100
What kind of a relief?

427
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
We need to solve the problem.

428
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,100
Go find Lu Ji.

429
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,900
Twenty soldiers, right?

430
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Even if we have 200 soldiers, we can't solve the problem.

431
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,180
Did the people who killed the Ninth Lord catch him?

432
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,700
They're catching him.

433
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,300
What about you?

434
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,060
Did the plan go well?

435
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,020
He's almost dead.

436
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,700
I heard you're going to play the piano for Shen Yirong.

437
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,820
Didn't the Duke of Su Palace not like to listen?

438
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,740
Why are you monitoring every step?

439
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,020
I don't need to listen.

440
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,180
Once I hear it, I feel like I'm dead.

441
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,820
I'll bring some oranges next time.

442
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,820
What do you mean?

443
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,420
Solve the problem.

444
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,220
You're going to play the same show with Jiang Li?

445
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,540
What are you thinking about? Don't kill me.

446
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,300
If the Princess of the Sect knows,

447
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,700
will all of us die?

448
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,140
The most dangerous person

449
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,780
can be at ease when he's around.

450
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,060
I'll go find him.

451
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,260
Son, do you still have feelings for Consort Xue?

452
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,620
Don't forget.

453
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,620
Jiang Li and Consort Xue are both enemies in the eyes of Princess.

454
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,820
You don't care about the relationship,

455
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,420
you're just trying to be a pervert.

456
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,020
What do you want the Princess of the Sect to think of?

457
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,740
Mother, don't worry.

458
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,500
I have my own reasons.

459
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,100
Your Highness.

460
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,940
They really started a Northern War recently.

461
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,940
A Northern War bet taking place recently in the wastes campus.

462
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,340
Create one during that call.

463
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,180
Do you feel like a graduate from the graduates' department?

464
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,860
No.

465
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,260
Some troops go in, some get in.

466
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,980
What are you expecting?

467
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,980
There are some words that are useless.

468
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,980
We should let him see it himself

469
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,980
so that he knows what he can't do.

470
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
Go.

471
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
Who is he?

472
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,980
The servant of the Qiang family.

473
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,980
It's good to have him.

474
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,980
I thought Shen Xuezhi would be curious first.

475
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,740
I thought Shen Xun would be curious

476
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,060
who the person who assassinated me was.

477
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,780
The government will find out.

478
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,340
It's not deep.

479
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,460
It's not heavy.

480
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,420
Come with me.

481
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,300
Han Lianyuan is in trouble.

482
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,860
I'll send someone to send you back.

483
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,620
What a good man.

484
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,820
I followed a few streets

485
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,580
and got kicked out.

486
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,940
Do you think

487
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,780
Shen Yurong sent the person today?

488
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,700
I saw the killer

489
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,980
and thought Shen Yurong was a big man.

490
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,420
If he didn't get him in time,

491
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,980
he would have died

492
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,620
if he didn't kill him.

493
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,420
That's what you said.

494
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,300
He's Wanning's man.

495
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,740
What a pity.

496
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,380
What a good man.

497
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,020
So this is your plan.

498
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:09,940
You...

499
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,100
You flew here?

500
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,340
What else?

501
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,860
You said you were close to Shen Yurong

502
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,460
just to catch his pen.

503
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,140
Now it seems

504
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,460
you want something

505
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,820
and you want to stimulate Wanning.

506
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,820
Wanning is Shen Yurong's pen.

507
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,540
I told you not to put yourself in the prison.

508
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,260
You didn't remember it, did you?

509
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,220
What is wrong with you?

510
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,100
Why didn't you剛 tell me?

511
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,340
Do you think he doesn't haveように지?

512
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,020
Zhao Ke kept me under the police,

513
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:51,620
I

514
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,740
believe the guards

515
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,100
want to protect me.

516
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,700
Answer me nicely.

517
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,300
Yao Ke staying on人

518
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,980
will beotalized

519
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,700
But now, I can only go this way.

520
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,780
I didn't expect

521
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,780
Wan Ning would send someone to kill me.

522
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,140
For this man,

523
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,740
if I go this way...

524
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,780
Don't talk nonsense.

525
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,300
I don't care about Wan Ning.

526
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,620
I know.

527
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,100
Do you want to care about me?

528
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,700
Don't worry.

529
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,500
I'll be able to do it

530
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,100
once I'm in the Bureau.

531
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,300
I promise I won't do it again.

532
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,580
What a coincidence.

533
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,980
Then why did you die with Shen Yurong?

534
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,460
Shen Yurong was killed for me today.

535
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,100
Did he die?

536
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,820
Yes.

537
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,460
So?

538
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,540
So I was wondering if I could change the path.

539
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,340
So, did you still go this way?

540
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,580
I really didn't.

541
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,340
Duke Su,

542
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,060
please believe me like I do.

543
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,980
DEVIL

544
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,260
Shen Lang,zen Lang,

545
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,460
You're so cour backlash.

546
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,060
Not only did you block my way just for her,

547
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,300
you even throw yourself out

548
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,660
a little before I did.

549
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,580
How dare you still support him?

550
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,900
Your Highness committed murder in the Holy Woods Gate.

551
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,620
Tomorrow, I'll be under a spell

552
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,420
toس Amail peu арier compositions.

553
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,860
That's my fault.

554
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,580
I just want to remind you, Your Highness.

555
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,180
If you want to kill him again,

556
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,500
don't drag me in.

557
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,100
What are you pretending to be?

558
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,380
He has Xiao Heng around him.

559
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,860
I won't have a chance

560
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,260
if I don't hit him.

561
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,580
Speaking of which,

562
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,740
you made me angry.

563
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,780
Why didn't you know me

564
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,180
and you're interested in him?

565
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,620
I don't want to be involved in any of this.

566
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,420
This is what His Majesty told me.

567
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,060
If I can't do it,

568
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,940
I'll be punished.

569
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,260
I'm here.

570
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,860
Who dares to punish you?

571
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,140
This is a court case.

572
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,180
I don't want to be

573
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,540
a person who is a burden to His Highness.

574
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,260
His Highness won't be

575
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,540
a person like me.

576
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,140
Moreover,

577
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,380
I've long been a humble and humble person.

578
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,380
I dare to say this to Jiang Li

579
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,420
that I'm a kind-hearted person.

580
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,180
You're really good at talking.

581
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,500
You'd better say it's true.

582
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,100
Otherwise,

583
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,140
you'll know my heart.

584
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,740
I wouldn't dare to lie to His Highness.

585
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,580
If that's the case,

586
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,500
you can go to the court

587
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,700
and settle your case.

588
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,460
Let me see

589
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,580
what you're asking for.

590
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,500
When I'm done,

591
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,980
I'll go and meet him.

592
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,100
Liu's body is blood or sounds.

593
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,060
I'll send him to aji Generally,

594
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,780
then you find the perfect path.

595
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,540
Yun Ao

596
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,740
Please wait a second.

597
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,740
Umm..

598
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,240
Using Wen Françaisé's milk

599
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,780
sincerely

600
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,780
Thank you, Shen Xueshi.

601
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
Get ready.

602
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,380
Jiang Li,

603
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,780
when everything is over,

604
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,780
let's drink well.

605
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,780
Yes.

606
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,780
We haven't been together for a long time.

607
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,280
Okay.

608
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:44,780
Then we'll go first.

609
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,780
There are many things to do.

610
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,280
Let's go first.

611
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,780
Let's go.

612
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,780
Okay.

613
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,780
Jiang Li.

614
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,780
Jiang Li.

615
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,780
Listen to me.

616
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,780
Why is it over so soon?

617
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,780
I'm still a little nervous.

618
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,780
What?

619
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,780
You said you'd drink.

620
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,780
The things you gave me

621
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,780
are not what I like.

622
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,780
I've been smiling a lot lately.

623
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,780
But to be honest,

624
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,780
as long as there's something to do,

625
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,780
I can do it for you.

626
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
Okay.

627
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
Jiang Li.

628
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
I'll go first.

629
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
Okay.

630
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,780
Cousin.

631
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,780
I heard that

632
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
Hanlin Academy

633
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,780
is willing to drink with you.

634
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
So you're with Shen Xueshi.

635
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,780
But I saw Zhao Qi

636
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,780
and you

637
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,780
seem to be in a relationship.

638
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
Shen Xueshi's talent

639
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,780
is not Hanlin Academy's.

640
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,780
It's better for me to be with him.

641
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,780
I'll go practice.

642
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,780
Your Majesty.

643
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,780
Li Bu has already taken

644
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,780
the Zhu Xiang Shiyi of the Great Zhao Group

645
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,780
to the capital.

646
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,780
Honglu Siqing

647
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,780
went to the capital today.

648
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,780
He was in the imperial court.

649
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,780
He was in the imperial court.

650
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,780
He was in the imperial court

651
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,780
after the group was settled.

652
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
He was in the imperial court.

653
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

654
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,780
Did you catch Chu Lan?

655
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,780
He was basically in the imperial court.

656
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,780
The imperial court?

657
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,780
Did they also

658
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,780
get into trouble?

659
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,780
How about the princess of the Great Zhao?

660
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,780
I can't get hurt now.

661
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,780
If you keep doing this,

662
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,780
it'll be bad for us.

663
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
I'm also worried about this.

664
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,780
The meeting was urgent.

665
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,780
The Ninth Moon was also

666
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,780
so agitated.

667
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,780
The assassin is still in the capital.

668
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,780
The Great Zhao will surely

669
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,780
be suspicious of me

670
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,780
and the business.

671
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,780
He will be in danger.

672
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
I'll go to the capital

673
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,780
and ask for your help.

674
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
The business is going well.

675
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
He is in the capital.

676
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,780
He has a new layer of change.

677
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,780
Then you take this opportunity

678
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,780
to kill Huang Chengsi.

679
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,780
How can you

680
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,780
find me in the capital?

681
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,780
My safety is in the hands of the capital.

682
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,780
But I can't kill Huang Chengsi.

683
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,780
What do you want to do?

684
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,780
I want Long Wujun.

685
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,780
Long Wujun?

686
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,780
You've been training for so long.

687
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,780
Are you going to expose me now?

688
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,780
Since they have already

689
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,780
arranged the stage,

690
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,780
why don't we sing a song

691
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,780
to cheer for them?

692
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,780
Remember.

693
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
The city is the key

694
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
to our quiet city.

695
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,780
Please keep in touch with us.

696
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,780
Understand?

697
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,780
Yes.

698
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,780
You're going to finish the mission.

699
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
Very good.

700
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,780
Prime Minister Li.

701
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,780
Why is Duke Su

702
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,780
free to come to Huang Chengsi?

703
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,780
I received a message

704
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
that he has hidden

705
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
the assassin

706
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
in Beijing.

707
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,780
Duke Su, you have to

708
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
speak the truth.

709
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,780
Prime Minister Li.

710
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,780
I'm the kindest person

711
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,780
to report to you.

712
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,780
I'll find out

713
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,780
the truth in Huang Chengsi.

714
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
Guards.

715
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,780
Duke Su.

716
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,780
Huang Chengsi is not a soft man.

717
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,780
You're in the other side of the drug market.

718
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
You're in my side.

719
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,780
You're not qualified.

720
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
Anyway,

721
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,780
I have a good idea.

722
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,780
After you.

723
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,780
He's dangerous.

724
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,780
Go in the steamer,

725
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,280
quick.

726
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,780
Sky,

727
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,780
be careful.

728
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,780
When General Rong Wu Eurov sludge,

729
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,780
can he pick a fight?

730
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,440
How

731
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
are you treating the Sword?

732
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,500
Search!

733
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,100
If anyone dares to stop you,

734
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,940
just cut them off.

735
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,540
Search!

736
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,340
Yes!

737
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,220
Prime Minister Li, you'd better stay away from me.

738
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,740
I'll see you in the sword.

739
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,540
If you don't stay,

740
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,740
I'll kill you first.

741
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,740
Prime Minister Su,

742
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,180
have you thought about the consequences?

743
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,620
The water is boiling.

744
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,460
Don't let the old man run away.

745
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,140
Yes.

746
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,300
Shri Lin

747
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,180
Dare Hui

748
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,500
to try to loose me?

749
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,540
Men

750
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,140
Who are you?

751
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,140
You dare to come?

752
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,140
You can't escape this time.

753
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,140
I brought my little brother here.

754
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,140
He's not very cruel.

755
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,140
He's a dog who's on the road.

756
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,140
Go!

757
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,140
Prince Cheng's men escaped again.

758
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,140
Chu Lan is as good as Prince Cheng.

759
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,140
It's like you're as good as me.

760
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,140
You're not that good at catching him.

761
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,140
You can take this opportunity

762
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,140
to summon the people of the Imperial City to the palace.

763
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,140
I was not very good at it yesterday.

764
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,140
There are many people who need to be treated at home.

765
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,140
Because of you,

766
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,140
I'm not that good at it.

767
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,140
I'm not that good at it.

768
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,140
I'm not that good at it.

769
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,140
I'm not that good at it.

770
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,140
I'm not that good at it.

771
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,140
Because of this,

772
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,140
many people are greedy about you.

773
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,140
Yuan Jiang secretly escaped.

774
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,140
He was sent to Chu Lan.

775
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,140
This crime is enough to make him pay for it.

776
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,140
He's quite smart.

777
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,140
He found a subordinate to punish him.

778
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,140
He's resigned.

779
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,140
But I'm very cautious.

780
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,140
It's not the time for us to be cautious.

781
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,140
It's time to take back the Royal City

782
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,140
and kill Prince Cheng.

783
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,140
Yuan Jiang and Li Zhongnan

784
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,140
will be settled in the future.

785
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,140
You have no choice.

786
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,140
You have no choice.

787
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,140
My father.

788
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,140
Who leaked the news that Chu Lan was in the Imperial City?

789
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,140
I don't know.

790
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,140
The Royal City is not a secret.

791
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,140
Do you know that there are only 3 of us

792
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,140
who leaked the news?

793
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,140
Did Chu Lan leaked it himself?

794
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,140
My father.

795
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,140
If it wasn't her,

796
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,140
only you and I

797
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
were not me, but you!

798
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,140
My father.

799
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,140
It's Xiao Heng.

800
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,140
Xiao Heng has violated my plan.

801
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,140
It's hard for me to explain.

802
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,140
His Majesty's personal life is not a matter of fate.

803
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,140
How much can Xiao Heng have?

804
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,140
He's not a rival of Yuanjiang at all.

805
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,140
So I've used Chu Lan Wei's bait

806
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,140
to attract him here.

807
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,140
It's also a good chance to test

808
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,140
the royal decree.

809
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,140
Is it a trap?

810
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,140
But I never thought

811
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,140
that Xiao Heng actually brought Long Wu Jun here.

812
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,140
Father, it's my fault.

813
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,140
It's my mistake.

814
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,140
Please punish me.

815
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,140
Bastard!

816
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
Father, you dare to do this without my head.

817
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,140
You dare to do this without my head.

818
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,140
I've been so angry that

819
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
I've been beaten to death by you.

820
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,140
Now that His Majesty is dead,

821
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,140
how can we do this?

822
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,140
Father, please give me another chance.

823
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,140
I won't let you down.

824
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,140
You're not allowed to do anything

825
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,140
that's not right.

826
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,140
Father!

827
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,140
Father!

828
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,140
Father!

829
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

830
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

831
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

832
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,140
I'm the Emperor of Yan,

833
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,140
Duke Su.

834
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,140
I'm the son of Li Guan,

835
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,140
and I'm from the same family.

836
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,140
I'm Duke Su, Xiao Heng.

837
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,140
Nice to meet you, Your Majesty.

838
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,140
Please be patient with me

839
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,140
and come to the palace tomorrow.

840
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,140
Your Majesty is so kind.

841
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,140
I'm really grateful for your kindness.

842
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,140
Duke Su,

843
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,140
Duke Su,

844
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,140
my sister is in the palace.

845
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,140
Jiuyun!

846
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,140
Brother!

847
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,140
Brother is here.

848
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,140
I heard you were injured.

849
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,140
Is it okay?

850
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,140
Did you catch the person who was the assassin?

851
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,140
Who did this?

852
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,140
Fortunately, Duke Su helped me.

853
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,140
I'm fine.

854
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,140
Duke Su is still investigating this matter.

855
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,140
Brother,

856
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,140
don't blame me.

857
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,140
I don't believe Duke Su

858
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,140
so much.

859
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,140
I can't help you.

860
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,140
But please, Duke Su,

861
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,140
give me an explanation.

862
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,140
I will.

863
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,140
Your Majesty, please.

864
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,140
Duke Su.

865
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,140
Your Majesty.

866
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,140
Your Majesty.

867
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,140
My son.

868
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,140
Your Majesty.

869
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,140
Your Majesty.

870
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,140
Your Majesty.

871
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,420
upon this amazing feast.

872
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,300
We've managed to feel

873
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:17,160
the clever way to ease the sickness and be

874
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,620
the great ABSOR bijin Wang.

875
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:30,400
The reunion of mother Zhao

876
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,240
It's very convenient for people to check out that mess.

877
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,240
Wen Peng Lai.

878
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,280
Welcome.

879
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,120
Zhe'er,

880
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,920
come in.

881
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,240
Having a meal with me,

882
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,880
I finallychef

883
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,240
Lower the sedan guard and

884
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,400
drive me out on the way.

885
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,800
Dis ln ch later,

886
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,660
as young as a young boy.

887
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,580
At night, I keep thinking.

888
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,520
Why must I eat here?

889
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,280
The Court of Justice

890
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,260
feeds you gifts inитель.

891
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,180
Long 뮨

892
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,660
that I'm with you to write a beautiful poem.

893
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,100
It weighed on me that

894
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,840
many troubles

895
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,580
come one day to you.

896
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,960
I'm only

897
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,040
You are clever.

898
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,640
Please have a cup of alcoholic drink.

899
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,760
feature of water.

900
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,520
on the road.

901
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:38,960
Define.

902
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,320
Define.

903
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,960
I'm going to send the army and the nine months to the border today.

904
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,960
When will you come back?

905
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,960
Not sure.

906
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,960
What do you think of my talk yesterday?

907
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,960
It's hard to listen to.

908
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,960
I also think this is the most difficult time I've ever talked about.

909
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,960
Next time, I'll play other songs for you.

910
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,960
Then I'll remember.

911
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,960
You don't have to come here anymore.

912
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,960
Of course not.

913
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,960
Duke Su, you have to go back early.

914
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,960
I can return it early.

915
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,960
Then I'll send you a message before I leave.

916
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,960
What message?

917
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,960
The past is the present.

918
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,960
It's good to be honest.

919
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
Never do anything else because of others.

920
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,960
That other person also includes me.

921
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,960
Happy memories.

922
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,960
How can I pass through the sad and sad times?

923
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,960
Two cold words,

924
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,960
an endless struggle.

925
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,960
Holding hands,

926
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,960
can I pass through the snow?

927
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,960
In the cold wind,

928
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,960
in the long night,

929
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:03,960
the warmth that is left behind is embrace.

930
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:11,960
The sound of the sun is not built,

931
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,960
can I bury the traces of yesterday?

932
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,960
Love is a game of life,

933
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:33,960
even if it's a little bit of a game,

934
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:41,960
no matter how much I believe in the life,

935
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:48,960
I'd rather be trapped in the world.

936
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:55,960
I'll continue to be brave,

937
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:03,960
love until I'm free.

938
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,960
The scenery of the spring and the spring are only for you.

939
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,960
After the light is gone,

940
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,960
I won't be in the distance.

941
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,960
After the light is gone,

942
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,960
I won't be in the distance.
