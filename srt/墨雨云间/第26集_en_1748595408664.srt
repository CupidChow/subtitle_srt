1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've walked through the cold winter and I still feel lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When the spring color is still the same

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 1

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The ghost is a human being.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The person who was burned should also be a person.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Or else, it's not the words.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Investigate all the dead before they are alive.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Find out the common place.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The answer is just a shadow.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Next, it's the main character.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What's the motive?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Tomorrow is the day of the Jiang family.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Nothing else.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Chu Jun is worried that the second wife will be implicated.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How about I go with her?

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Come back.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Who told you to go?

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Put your mind on the main character.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Put your mind on the main character.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why is Chu Jun's mood so bad?

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You let me send the letter later.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I won't follow you later.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You didn't even see Jia'er last time.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You must be worried.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Something's wrong.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why are you so stubborn?

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I've always been like this.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And you are probably fooled by the military.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Jiang is my son.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He is my family.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We have been together for 48 years.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't move.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Liyer.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Jiang Liyin.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What is this system?

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,400
Brother, this is a bad rule.

49
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,440
Mrs. Ye,

50
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,320
I think you've already left the group.

51
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,280
Please don't worry.

52
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,760
I'll help her

53
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,360
to get back the palace.

54
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,280
Li,

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,280
we can't lose to you.

56
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,800
You've changed the rules.

57
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,240
Come down now.

58
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,440
Yes.

59
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,360
My husband is my mother.

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,960
I didn't tell him.

61
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,600
Father,

62
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,080
I haven't seen you for a long time.

63
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,560
Please forgive me.

64
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,240
Li,

65
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
did you hear what you said?

66
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,160
You can leave the house as you like.

67
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,840
Now you're in the family.

68
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,000
Please accept your letter

69
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,840
in front of the ancestors.

70
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,600
I want to give my mother a head.

71
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,480
I hope you'll accept it.

72
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,280
It seems

73
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,600
you must break the rule today.

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,280
I'm just a gift.

75
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,080
Xiang Li.

76
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,120
Forget it.

77
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,520
Let her be defeated.

78
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,400
This is the rule left by the ancestors.

79
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,320
If you break the rule,

80
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,800
you'll bring trouble to the family.

81
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,440
My husband,

82
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,520
there's always someone who's talking about the rules.

83
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,880
If you don't want to be a bad person,

84
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,240
I'll do it.

85
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,920
Madam.

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,080
Xiang Li, get up.

87
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,680
Get up.

88
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,480
Get up.

89
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,440
You're a good girl.

90
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,360
Get up.

91
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,600
Get up.

92
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,880
Don't beat me.

93
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,840
Let go.

94
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,040
Get up.

95
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,880
Don't be mad at me.

96
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,480
Don't be mad at me.

97
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't be mad at me.

98
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,800
Get up.

99
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,560
Get up.

100
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,560
Get up.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,680
Aunt.

102
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,360
Why did she come out?

103
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,120
Someone,

104
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,640
take her back.

105
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,680
Hurry.

106
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,880
Aunt.

107
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,240
Go.

108
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,320
Take her back.

109
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,880
Aunt.

110
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,400
My daughter.

111
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,000
Aunt.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,640
My daughter.

113
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,040
Go.

114
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,000
Hurry.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
My daughter.

116
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,000
My daughter.

117
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,400
Aunt.

118
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
My daughter.

119
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,040
Aunt.

120
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,120
Madam.

121
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,840
Are you all right?

122
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,400
Let's go.

123
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,440
Go back.

124
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,360
Look here.

125
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,720
Go and hurry, the emergency procedures.

126
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,800
Me and Brother Xifeng.

127
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,000
Ask Father Xifeng

128
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:47,920
to get off work.

129
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,640
Go.

130
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,720
Madam,

131
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,400
please differ from the rest.

132
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,960
Madam,

133
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,480
Mrs. Hu wore the已經 Seng Ge ك resize the Dorao Ring

134
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,560
for a short period of time.

135
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,280
Don't mention the wind.

136
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Hu Yiniang was originally a maid.

137
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
She was pregnant with your mother.

138
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
She was not fit for the big deal.

139
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
Old Madam was not allowed to have children.

140
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
After all, if she had a son,

141
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
the eldest son of the Jiang family

142
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
would be a maid.

143
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
It's not appropriate.

144
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
But your mother is kind.

145
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,280
She can take care of the children in her and her father.

146
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Please forgive her

147
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
for the sake of the child.

148
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Hu Yiniang

149
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
was grateful to your mother.

150
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,280
She was always kind and kind.

151
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
In the past two years,

152
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
your mother has also had you.

153
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
The seven families of the Jiang family

154
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,280
are also a family in the high-ranking household.

155
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
What happened next?

156
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Since your mother passed away,

157
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,280
everything in the Jiang family has changed.

158
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
After your mother passed away,

159
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,280
everything in the Jiang family has changed.

160
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
When Xiangyue was playing with the sand in the mountains,

161
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,280
she was taken by the maid who passed away in the middle of the night.

162
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Help!

163
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Help!

164
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,280
Xiangyue, wake up.

165
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
Wake up.

166
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Open your eyes and look at me.

167
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Look at me.

168
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
I'll take you back, okay?

169
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
I'll take you back.

170
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Yul.

171
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Yul.

172
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Since then,

173
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Hu Yiniang has been sad all night.

174
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,280
She has a whole family.

175
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,280
She has been busy with her work every day.

176
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,280
She can't help herself.

177
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
That's why she closed the room behind the yard.

178
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Yul.

179
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Since she was locked in the room,

180
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
why did she appear here?

181
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
That's all.

182
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
The day you were sent to the Zhenyu Hall,

183
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,280
Hu Yiniang also disappeared from the room.

184
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
She was found for the first half of the day.

185
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
She didn't see the shadow.

186
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
I'll go first.

187
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Yul.

188
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Yul.

189
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Where did you guess she went?

190
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
She was crazy.

191
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
She didn't have a carriage.

192
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Everyone didn't know

193
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
why she came here.

194
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
But from the wife's perspective,

195
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
she has been

196
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
being so strict.

197
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
She is so strict.

198
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
She thinks it's dangerous

199
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
to lock her up in the house.

200
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
So she ordered

201
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
to close the room

202
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
by her side.

203
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
She is a good girl.

204
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
It seems that

205
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Hu Yiniang is also a hard-working person.

206
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,280
Since she is so good to my mother,

207
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,280
I should come to see her often.

208
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
No.

209
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
She is crazy.

210
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
She will hit people.

211
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
And if you come again,

212
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
what if others see her?

213
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
They will talk.

214
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
It's okay.

215
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
I will have a chance in the future.

216
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
Fine.

217
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
Tong An.

218
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Do you think

219
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Hu Yiniang is a little strange?

220
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
Strange?

221
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
How strange?

222
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
It seems that she has been

223
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
observing me in secret.

224
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Especially after I hit the technician,

225
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,280
her eyes almost hit me.

226
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
It's strange anyway.

227
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Are you suspecting that she is ill?

228
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
But a common person,

229
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
how can he pretend to be stupid?

230
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,280
And he is watching the dead?

231
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Let's go.

232
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Stop.

233
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Stop.

234
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Are you okay?

235
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
I'm fine.

236
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
What's going on?

237
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Erniang.

238
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
The Jiangsheng is broken.

240
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
And my mother is gone.

241
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
How can the Jiangsheng be broken?

242
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Maybe she is saved.

243
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
I will find the horse now.

244
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Go.

245
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
What's going on?

246
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Third Sister, my horse is gone.

247
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
I'm so angry.

248
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
Qing Hua,

249
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
you and her maid stay here.

250
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
You go to the car first.

251
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Yes.

252
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
What?

253
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
You want to go back later?

254
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
And then you can tell me

255
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
about your father and grandmother's face?

256
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
You are so good at talking.

257
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
I don't want to wait for you.

258
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
You are so insincere.

259
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
My mother made you go to the car first.

260
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
If so,

261
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
thank you, Third Sister.

262
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
You should know

263
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
that I'm going to be married to Qi's snake.

264
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
I heard that.

265
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,280
You ruined my engagement with Zhou Yanbang.

266
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
You must be in trouble now.

267
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
She is not your wife.

268
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
What do you know?

269
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
It's a matter of time.

270
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
You have half of your memories with me.

271
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
If I remember it wrongly,

272
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
you and Ji Shuran

273
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
will kill me first.

274
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Then you should come back

275
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
and fight against our mother and daughter.

276
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
If you could stay in the town

277
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
and stay in Zhenyu Hall,

278
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
you wouldn't have anything

279
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
that I had done.

280
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
I'm still the only daughter of Jiang family.

281
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
It's all your fault.

282
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
It's all your fault.

283
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,280
You said that I took away your everything.

284
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Have you ever thought that

285
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
everything you have

286
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,280
is taken away from anyone?

287
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Do you know

288
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,280
what kind of life I have been living in Zhenyu Hall?

289
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,280
How do you feel about living in Zhenyu Hall?

290
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Give me your hand.

291
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Does it hurt?

292
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
I'm asking you if it hurts.

293
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
The pain I suffered in Zhenyu Hall

294
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
is the pain of death.

295
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
It's ten thousand times.

296
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
When I was eight years old,

297
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,280
I was really hurt by your mother.

298
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
They designed it

299
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
and made me go to Zhenyu Hall in a wrong way.

300
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Why?

301
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
They didn't allow me

302
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,280
to come back for my own sake?

303
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,280
I have no prejudice and no grudge against you.

304
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,280
We were still young back then.

305
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
I believe

306
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
that I didn't have your idea

307
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,280
after I stayed in Zhenyu Hall for so many years.

308
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Now I'm back.

309
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
I just want to take back

310
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,280
what belongs to Jiang family.

311
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
That's all.

312
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
If you insist on thinking

313
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
that I took away everything you have,

314
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
and forced me everywhere,

315
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,280
I can only tell you that I'm stupid.

316
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
What did you say?

317
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
Say it again.

318
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,280
What else can I say?

319
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
I...

320
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
Jiang Ruoyang,

321
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
you're a fool in Zhenzhai Courtyard, right?

322
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,280
As the enemy of Jiang family,

323
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
you're a useless person like Zhou family.

324
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,280
Think about the details of the case

325
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
that you've been trying to get rid of.

326
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Don't you regret it?

327
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Now I'm scolding you for being stupid.

328
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
I can't say it clearly.

329
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Don't think that

330
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
you'll listen to me

331
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,280
if you talk about it in front of me.

332
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
No matter what,

333
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
you owe me a favor.

334
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
I'll pay for what you did.

335
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
What favor?

336
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Don't move.

337
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Be careful.

338
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Come with me.

339
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Wang Huantu portrait

340
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
in Xiang responsive

341
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,680
my copy

342
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,320
Yaren

343
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
You shouldn't have changed it.

344
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
We're just再次

345
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,500
to buy the painting

346
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,280
to ask where she partly艰菜.

347
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
We're trying too hard,

348
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
with our wishes.

349
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
ask if...

350
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,000
Her fault is we relented.

351
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,800
Without her,

352
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
we would than have been together.

353
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Think about it.

354
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,000
Before Jiang Li came back,

355
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,120
you were the most beautiful and kind-hearted woman in the whole capital.

356
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,280
I was also the good son of the wealth and the double-edged sword.

357
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,440
We are now like this.

358
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,680
Shouldn't Jiang Li die? Shouldn't he?

359
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,120
You are going to kill him?

360
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,640
Shanshan,

361
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,680
who can find us if we don't know the truth?

362
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,280
If we find out,

363
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,120
the family is not allowed to be raised,

364
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,640
Jiang Jia and the Zhou family will definitely protect us.

365
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,080
Are you crazy?

366
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,120
This is human life!

367
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,400
I am a disaster in this world.

368
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,720
We will never be able to love you!

369
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,920
Shuo Yao,

370
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,880
I did this.

371
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,840
You want us to be together.

372
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,800
Last night,

373
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,040
what you said,

374
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,080
did you forget?

375
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,360
Shuo Yao,

376
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,480
I finally saw you.

377
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,160
Didn't you marry Fourth Sister now?

378
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,520
What are you talking about now?

379
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,920
Shuo Yao,

380
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,520
you clearly know that

381
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
I was designed by someone.

382
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,920
Moreover, I have never given you any letter.

383
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,480
I have never touched Jiang You'e.

384
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,640
I only have you in my heart.

385
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,560
What's the use of saying this now?

386
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,520
Do you know...

387
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,480
Do you know that

388
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,240
my mother is going to arrange for me to leave?

389
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,960
Why don't we

390
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,040
go to the capital?

391
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,760
What?

392
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,760
Let's go to the outside world.

393
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,640
Let's go to a place that is surrounded by green mountains and rivers.

394
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,360
Before we leave,

395
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,200
let's stay there for a short time.

396
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,920
We will stay away from the eyes and all the things that you don't like.

397
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,640
We will only be together.

398
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,400
But my mother,

399
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,520
I am very close to her now.

400
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,000
I am afraid that after a while,

401
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,480
she will not be able to get money from home.

402
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,440
How can I make you feel uncomfortable?

403
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,120
I will go to the capital.

404
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,040
If not, I can go to work.

405
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,280
Anyway, no matter what, I will not trouble you.

406
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,800
You are a member of the family of the family.

407
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,280
How can you...

408
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,680
Then how can I...

409
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,160
I only want to stay with you.

410
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,120
Shuang Yao,

411
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,760
I suddenly remembered someone.

412
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,320
He should be able to get this money.

413
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,760
Who?

414
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,920
Jiang Li.

415
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,880
He has a family of Ye family.

416
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,360
If we kidnap him,

417
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,800
we will surely get a lot of money.

418
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,680
We will have enough time to live.

419
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,320
You want to kill him once you leave, right?

420
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,720
You are always lying to me.

421
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,240
Shuang Yao, believe me.

422
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,760
I will not harm you.

423
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
Shuang Yao, believe me.

424
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,440
Shuang Yao, Shuang Yao, you can't leave.

425
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,880
If you leave, we will be doomed, Shuang Yao.

426
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,560
Let me go.

427
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,840
Shuang Yao, listen to me.

428
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,800
Shuang Yao, Shuang Yao.

429
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,320
Why are you forcing me

430
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,400
to tidy up

431
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,080
your easily priced house?

432
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm afraid that you'll be in the palace for the night.

433
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Why do you want to frame me?

434
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
I've never thought about framing you.

435
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,800
That day, I was like you.

436
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
I fell into the trap of the trap.

437
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
What a coincidence.

438
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Jiang Yu'e has already told me that you're behind all this!

439
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

440
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
It's you who let me down.

441
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
It's you who...

442
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
You let me down.

443
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,800
It's you who caused me to fall into this trap.

444
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
You can't escape.

445
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Qiang Li.

446
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Don't you think that you're very precious?

447
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Okay.

448
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Why don't we just make up for the past moments of spring and summer?

449
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Zhou Yuanbang.

450
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,800
You're at least the son of the Niu Yuan family.

451
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
How could you be so stupid?

452
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,800
You can't even figure out who you really are!

453
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
What are you talking about?

454
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
I can't believe you're here to teach me!

455
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,800
If so, I'll have nothing to do with it today.

456
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Do you think you can escape?

457
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Even if the Zhou family and the Jiang family don't follow me,

458
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
I'll still have the Ye family behind me.

459
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,800
You're trying to attack the son and you're in a big trouble.

460
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
You're so selfish.

461
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
You're going to die in the Zhou family!

462
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Qiang Li.

463
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
I almost got fooled by you again.

464
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
But you reminded me that

465
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,800
after I finished you,

466
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,800
I'll first cut your foot and your hand.

467
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Then I'll cut your tongue.

468
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Then I'll cut your eye and nail.

469
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,800
At that time, you can't even see it with your eyes, hands, and blood.

470
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,800
How could you just leave me?

471
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Wait!

472
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Zhu Yanbang.

473
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
You treat me like this in front of Ruo Yao.

474
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Aren't you afraid of hurting her?

475
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Our Jiang family and sister have a lot of problems.

476
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Only Ruo Yao is the only one she has.

477
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
She only has you in her heart.

478
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
No matter what I do,

479
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,800
as long as I'm the one who's good at it, she'll forgive me.

480
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,800
She's been looked after by her mother since she was a child.

481
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,800
As long as I'm a little bit more careful,

482
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,800
she'll follow me to the end.

483
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,800
But you're so good at it.

484
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
You're hurting her.

485
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
You want to take revenge.

486
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
No.

487
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Ruo Yao is the one who forgave you because she likes you.

488
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Since you're using her feelings,

489
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
do you really have her in your heart?

490
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,800
If she's not Jiang Yuanbai's daughter,

491
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
will I marry her?

492
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
No problem, right?

493
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Let's start.

494
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Let go!

495
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Let go!

496
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Zhu Yanbang!

497
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,800
You're the one who caused it today.

498
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
I killed her.

499
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
I killed her.

500
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
I killed her.

501
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
I killed her.

502
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Don't panic.

503
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
She's not dead yet.

504
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Jiang Ruo Yao,

505
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
for someone like this,

506
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,800
how much did you lose your true heart?

507
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Enough.

508
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Pack up and go home.

509
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,800
I'm afraid you can't handle this.

510
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,800
I think you've already caused Zhu Yanbang's death.

511
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
I'm not going to pursue you.

512
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
You've designed a divorce for me.

513
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Think about it.

514
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
How do you explain to Zhu Jiajie?

515
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Brother.

516
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Madam.

517
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Madam.

518
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Are you back?

519
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Why hasn't Ruo Yao come back yet?

520
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Didn't she come back with our team?

521
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
I think it's weird.

522
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
And she didn't come back from Jiangli.

523
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
What?

524
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Mother Su.

525
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Mother Su.

526
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
What?

527
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
What's wrong?

528
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
What's wrong?

529
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
What's wrong?

530
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
What's wrong?

531
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
What's wrong?

532
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
What's wrong?

533
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
What's wrong?

534
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
What's wrong?

535
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
What's wrong?

536
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
What's wrong?

537
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
What's wrong?

538
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
You said you came back with Jiangli and her wife.

539
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
But you took blood on you.

540
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
What?

541
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
You're like a bitch.

542
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,800
You're like the mad girl who's started a fight.

543
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
You didn't want to be in the top.

544
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
You didn't even know the use!

545
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,800
How could I be born into a girl like you?

546
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Mother, what should I do?

547
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
What should I do?

548
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,600
Why don't you think about it now?

549
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,160
Mother, I'm scared.

550
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,320
You deserve it.

551
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,000
Mother.

552
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,760
Don't call me.

553
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
From now on,

554
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,000
stay in this yard with me.

555
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,120
You can't come out without my permission.

556
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,640
Mother.

557
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,520
Madam.

558
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
These three ladies are really scared now.

559
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,840
They should be safe.

560
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,680
Safe?

561
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,680
She didn't think about it.

562
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,920
She did something stupid.

563
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,600
I was too bad to her in the past.

564
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,440
That's why I made her so ignorant.

565
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,880
Let her wake up now.

566
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,920
Go and tell Jiang Yuer a story.

567
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,400
Tell her not to see it.

568
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,560
Tell her...

569
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,760
Yes.

570
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,600
My son, Yan Bao.

571
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,480
My son.

572
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Why did you let me come here?

573
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,040
I was too scared to go.

574
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,560
I just wanted to take her away.

575
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,600
But she died.

576
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,960
I was so confused.

577
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm so sorry.

578
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,840
Jiang Li.

579
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,520
Come out with me.

580
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,080
You can't go.

581
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,000
Why are you stopping me?

582
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,120
What are you doing?

583
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,040
What are you doing?

584
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,760
What are you doing?

585
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,600
Jiang Xiangbo.

586
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,000
Jiang Xiangbo.

587
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,160
My son almost died.

588
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,920
It's because of Jiang Li.

589
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,720
He has to come out today.

590
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,280
Tell me a story.

591
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,200
Jiang Li.

592
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,720
You can't go.

593
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,360
Jiang Li.

594
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,640
You can't go.

595
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,440
Or I won't leave today.

596
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,600
Jiang Li.

597
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,080
Come out with me.

598
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,400
Come out with me.

599
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,840
I've found Jiueyue.

600
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,520
Chu Jun.

601
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
You don't know.

602
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,000
She's always looking for us.

603
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,640
How can we find her?

604
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,600
Why are you in such a hurry?

605
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,520
Second Young Madam, something happened.

606
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,680
Second Young Madam.

607
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,400
Mistress, please go to the Imperial Court.

608
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,520
You ShouldanAA

609
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,360
should give me a way.

610
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,960
My son

611
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,680
became a ringleader.

612
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,560
If I don'tolid

613
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,880
for him ,

614
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,160
we just have to go.

615
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,760
Jiang Li.

616
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
As for you,

617
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,980
everything is going in a mess.

618
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,680
Father,

619
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,760
public opinion will have more.

620
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,920
If you try?

621
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,120
It is illegal.

622
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
When I returned home last night,

623
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,120
the car driver brought me to the place of panic.

624
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,120
When I came back, the car driver disappeared.

625
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Then, Zhou Yambang

626
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,120
brought me to a broken room.

627
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Mr. Zhou, he was trying to avoid me.

628
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,120
Fortunately, Third Sister came in time and stopped him.

629
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,120
I was going to buy some things yesterday.

630
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
He came back late.

631
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,120
He didn't tell me that he saw you.

632
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Look, you're so ridiculous.

633
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,120
You must be the one who stole the money.

634
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,120
You tried to seduce our Yan'er.

635
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
You're afraid that she'll grow up.

636
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
That's why you killed her.

637
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,120
As what Mrs. Ning Yuan Hou said,

638
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
what's going on?

639
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,120
Did I hurt myself?

640
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Just admit it yourself.

641
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,120
Father, Ruo Yao was at the scene yesterday.

642
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Why don't you ask Third Sister to come over?

643
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,120
It's okay. I'll go call Ruo Yao.

644
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,120
You've made up your mind.

645
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Later, you'll say that you don't know

646
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
that I've arranged everything else.

647
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Mother, I don't want to go.

648
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
You were asking me what to do yesterday.

649
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
You were afraid of being beaten up today.

650
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,120
You thought Jiang Li pushed everything on you.

651
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Do you still want to keep yourself safe?

652
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Be patient.

653
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Don't let Jiang Li get away with it.

654
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
Let's go and take a rest.

655
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Mother, from yesterday to now,

656
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
you're so shameless.

657
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,120
Am I your own daughter?

658
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
What are you talking about?

659
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
Who did I do this for?

660
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Yao, you're obedient.

661
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,120
I did all this for your own good.

662
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,120
I've already told the Qi family that

663
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
when Jiang Li gets settled,

664
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,120
your marriage will be settled in a few days.

665
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,120
When you get married,

666
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,120
you won't suffer.

667
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,120
Ruo Yao, come and tell me.

668
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,120
You can look for the things about Yan'er and Jiang Li.

669
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,120
How did Second Sister say that?

670
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,120
The driver sent me to the remote area yesterday.

671
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Mr. Zhou was trying to avoid me.

672
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,120
It was you who saved me in time.

673
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,120
Ruo Yao, tell me.

674
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,120
What happened yesterday?

675
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Li, even if you're afraid of

676
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,120
hurting Zhong Yanbang,

677
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,120
you shouldn't have pushed things to her.

678
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
Even if you say that,

679
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Zhong Yanbang will be against you.

680
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,120
But why would Ruo Yao be there?

681
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Could it be that Yanbang took Ruo Yao to harm you?

682
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Mother.

683
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,120
Father, mother.

684
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Third Sister saw me yesterday and didn't return.

685
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,120
She was worried that I had an accident and she was out of the desert.

686
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,120
She was even more worried that I would be hurt and I would be saved.

687
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,120
Yesterday, thanks to Ruo Yao, I was not harmed.

688
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,120
Ruo Yao is a person I've seen growing up.

689
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,120
How could she have done something to Yan'er?

690
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,120
It must be you who made up your mind to get rid of her.

691
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
Father, I don't want to hear it.

692
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,120
Madam Ning Yuan, please calm down.

693
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,120
Madam Jiang, I'm here to ask you about our marriage.

694
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
I came to ask about it first.

695
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
Otherwise, I would have been exposed.

696
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
You two are parents.

697
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Is it possible that you two are just standing here?

698
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Since that's the case,

699
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
why don't we go to Yanmei Hall?

700
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
We'll have a fight once we've broken our faces.

701
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,120
I think that's the only way you two can give us a solution.

702
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,120
Li'er, let me ask you again.

703
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,120
What exactly happened between you and Mr. Zhou?

704
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Father, what I just said is true.

705
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,120
Fine, you still won't admit it.

706
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,120
My son is in a bad mood at home.

707
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,120
He doesn't know whether he can live or not.

708
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,120
Since that's the case, why should I leave you two to be?

709
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,120
Come on, tie him up and report him to the police.

710
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
Yes.

711
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
Wait.

712
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
What else do you want to say?

713
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,120
I don't want to ruin a pitiful person's reputation in Yanmei Hall.

714
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,120
What nonsense are you talking about?

715
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,120
I've already said what I should say.

716
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,120
I'll wait for Third Sister to say it.

717
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Third Sister, you still haven't said anything until now.

718
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
We are sisters.

719
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
I don't care what you are in the world.

720
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,120
You protected my love yesterday.

721
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,120
You are so kind to me.

722
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,120
You have never forgotten me.

723
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,120
You are originally a brave person.

724
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,120
Even if you make a mistake and believe it,

725
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,120
what's the big deal?

726
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,120
You shouldn't have done that for that person

727
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,120
and even scared yourself.

728
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,120
Li'er, stop forcing your sister.

729
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,120
She really can't help you to be a witness.

730
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,120
I didn't force her.

731
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,120
I'm just waiting for her to say it.

732
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,120
She's not a kid anymore.

733
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Is it because she still has to rely on her mother to make a move?

734
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
She's not making a mistake.

735
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,120
She should have done it herself.

736
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,120
She can't just be a witness forever.

737
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,120
What are you talking about?

738
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,120
How did you start to make a mess of our mother and daughter's relationship?

739
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
You've been left alone for so long.

740
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,120
You don't know anything.

741
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,120
Since you were a child, you only know how to go home

742
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
and hide in your room.

743
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
You'll be scared if someone else comes.

744
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
You'll be soft if someone else says something.

745
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
You're willing to be caught by someone.

746
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
Do you really understand?

747
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Since childhood, there's no master.

748
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,120
You can't be a witness forever.

749
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,120
Sister, do you understand what I mean?

750
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
She's been watching from a young age.

751
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,120
She doesn't have a master.

752
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
As long as I'm a little bit scared,

753
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,120
I'll be at ease.

754
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,120
Chu Yao is not feeling well.

755
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
Si Mamma.

756
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
Yes.

757
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,120
Take her back to her room and rest.

758
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
Yes.

759
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
San Yang, hurry up.

760
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Let's go back and rest.

761
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
Let's go.

762
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
Jiang Ruo Yao.

763
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,120
Have you ever been in your room?

764
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,120
Have you ever been in there?

765
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Themself, right?

766
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,120
Trying to fool me?

767
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,120
Solve him and bring him up!

768
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Shizuang.

769
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Yes.

770
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,120
Father, Shishi...

771
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
drums irrelevant role

772
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,120
I was at the scene and was careless.

773
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,440
I didn't say anything.

774
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,360
Xiang Ruoyou,

775
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,200
do you know what you're talking about?

776
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,280
I know.

777
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,520
Zhou Yanbang is a man of the past.

778
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,520
He's been acting like a ghost.

779
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,200
I'm not willing to

780
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,520
see her humiliated.

781
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,960
Under the circumstances,

782
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,720
I was too careless

783
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,640
to kill her.

784
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,840
I'm willing to

785
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,120
do anything I can.

786
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Ruoyou, you...

787
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,800
Jiang Xiangguo,

788
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,640
do you want to be the master of our family?

789
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,000
Master?

790
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,360
My daughter, Jiang Li,

791
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,960
should be the master of the family, right?

792
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
You should ask the Niangyuan Monkey

793
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,800
to be the master of the family.

794
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,920
Aren't you going to sue the servants?

795
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,280
You can ask them

796
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,960
if you know.

797
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,240
You...

798
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,200
You...

799
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,800
You...

800
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You Jiang family...

801
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,800
You...

802
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,160
Your Ladyship.

803
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,960
Your Ladyship.

804
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,800
Please go to the doctor.

805
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,720
Your Ladyship.

806
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,320
Your Ladyship.

807
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,040
Your Ladyship.

808
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:42,760
Your Ladyship.

809
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,440
Your Ladyship.

810
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,040
Your Ladyship.

811
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,680
You all go back to the house.

812
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,840
Your Ladyship.

813
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,000
Your Ladyship.

814
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,120
Wait a minute.

815
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,360
Why didn't you tell me

816
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,520
that I tied you to the Zhou Yanbang?

817
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,080
Jiang Li.

818
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,240
If I told you,

819
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,040
I forced you to bite to death.

820
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,760
You didn't know anything.

821
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,320
You're still trying to set me up.

822
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,760
I told you the truth.

823
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,840
I told you to take the Wei Mian of the Zhou Yanbang.

824
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,440
I told you to get to know the current position and not to punish you.

825
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,280
That's how I set you up.

826
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,120
Don't talk nonsense.

827
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,160
You must be very satisfied now.

828
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,600
You're giving up your life

829
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,360
and you want the Niangyuan Monkey wife to hate me.

830
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,120
Jiang Li.

831
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,280
From now on,

832
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,960
you're going to rob my Feng Teng.

833
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,360
You're going to rob my people.

834
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,680
You're going to rob my everything.

835
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,480
It's been so long.

836
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,200
Why are you still going to go with me?

837
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,160
If you don't come back,

838
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,360
I won't be like this.

839
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,080
I can.

840
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,320
I can die.

841
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,880
I can't.

842
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,640
If I don't come back,

843
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,680
you won't be like this.

844
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,840
You've already told me

845
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,920
many, many times.

846
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,640
Is that useful?

847
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,480
It's really because of me.

848
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,240
You've become like

849
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,920
the one you can't even see.

850
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,080
If you really married

851
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,120
Zhou Yanbang in a flash,

852
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,400
you're the one you like.

853
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,560
Aren't you afraid of it today?

854
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,520
You're going to hide again?

855
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,080
You're wrong.

856
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,760
You're going to hide when you're angry.

857
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,160
You're a heartless person.

858
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,040
You're not a lonely person.

859
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,160
How long can you keep your rules?

860
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,480
Stop talking!

861
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,680
Stop seriously although

862
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,000
you know otherwise!

863
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,480
I told you the truth today.

864
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
It's about being friendly

865
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,460
by yourself.

866
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,800
But it doesn't have to

867
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,800
be moral or當然.

868
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,780
I told the person

869
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,120
that you're so brave.

870
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,960
As Zhou Yanbang lost her sister,

871
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,760
you've tried

872
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,560
calling herscenes up,

873
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,280
but you still don't valueold people.

874
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,880
But you're not any less humorous person.

875
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
You know

876
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,560
that ¡ version of Zhou Yanbang

877
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,880
to think about it.

878
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,560
What is the real me?

879
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,720
No one cares about me.

880
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,120
What is the real Jiang Ruoyang?

881
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,600
For this girl,

882
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,840
she did everything.

883
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,240
But I can't believe

884
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,560
she has forced her to the final destination.

885
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,920
It's so strange.

886
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,880
Second Madam,

887
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,040
someone is looking for you outside.

888
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,640
Where is Jiang Li?

889
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,560
I've seen Ye Yuanwei.

890
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,240
My wife has gone out for business.

891
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,000
Business?

892
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,280
But I just got the news that

893
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,720
the matter about Lord Niwen is coming.

894
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,160
Did she take her away?

895
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,440
Today's matter is in danger.

896
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,200
Lord Niwen has solved it.

897
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,160
Then why did Jiang Liyou go out?

898
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
Don't say it.

899
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,720
I should know.

900
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,280
I remember the last time

901
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,040
Lord Niwen invited me to dinner

902
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,840
and invited me to eat buns in Luyang.

903
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,200
This time, it's really a big party.

904
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,160
You were happy

905
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,240
when you got Tong Zhiyang.

906
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,880
How about this time?

907
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,440
Can you have a drink?

908
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,960
Do you think I won this time?

909
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,800
Winning or losing is not important.

910
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
I'm not sure.

911
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
I'm not sure.

912
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
I'm not sure.

913
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
I'm not sure.

914
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,800
I'm not sure.

915
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
I'm not sure.

916
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
I'm not sure.

917
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,320
You always eat rice.

918
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,880
Do you know

919
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,160
my move, Duke of Su?

920
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,320
Can't you know

921
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,600
where your wife and son are?

922
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,520
I don't have a chance to change my position.

923
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,320
I also want to have a wife and son.

924
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,680
I want to be in this capital

925
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,000
and have a happy life with them.

926
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,200
What wife and son?

927
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Me?

928
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,720
Duke of Su dares to say this.

929
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
I don't dare.

930
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,280
But I also think

931
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
that a woman like us

932
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,760
can't be seen as a bigger world.

933
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
I'm not saying it.

934
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,480
I should thank Duke of Su

935
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,160
for the food today.

936
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,560
I'm happy today.

937
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,160
But I have to say

938
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,360
I can't drink too much.

939
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,680
Just one cup.

940
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,640
If you have a full stomach,

941
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,560
please don't give me a break.

942
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
No.

943
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,880
Say it.

944
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,680
Situ Jiuyue is not in the capital.

945
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,920
If I find her,

946
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,080
I'm afraid she'll need something.

947
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,320
I'll thank Duke of Su

948
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,600
for the food.

949
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,340
A upwards walk.

950
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,560
Just one cup.

951
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
Exactly.

952
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,360
After WWII

953
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,520
it's a bit hard.

954
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,480
I want to hang out for a while.

955
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,920
Then go to sleep.

956
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:51,780
don't we триab

957
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,480
I sleep poorly

958
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,680
This place where Duke Su chose

959
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,680
is really good.

960
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,680
It's good that you like it.

961
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,680
I have something for you.

962
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,680
What is it?

963
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,680
When you need something to burn this burn,

964
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,680
my person will appear to protect you for me.

965
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,680
In this way,

966
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,680
Duke Su will be in jail all day long.

967
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,680
You can also think about it.

968
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,680
Take it.

969
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,680
I just don't want to finish this game.

970
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,680
My chess piece

971
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,680
will be eaten by others.

972
