1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't admit it

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain of hiding

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
When spring comes, I'll return to my homeland

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The imperial decree is here

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Here it is

15
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,000
Pre consonants

16
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,440
You sÃ¤tt a report from Xie, Xie and Huan

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:15,460
Ray of law

18
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,000
Take one etch to confident the emperor

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Pro mid son

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The emperor is free

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't worry, madam. Have some soup.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
My husband.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How is His Majesty doing?

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
His Majesty is not well.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What does His Majesty mean?

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He is forcing me to be in danger.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't worry. I'll go to the palace tomorrow.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm worried about Consort Li.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's hard for you to do this.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I know the power of the madam in the mansion.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This matter is not only about Li'er's life and death.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's also about the honor of our family.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I will not do anything to it.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You think so?

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's good.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Li'er is locked up in the palace.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's so pitiful.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's not good for our family.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I live in the house.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I heard some rumors.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
They say our family's children are being taken.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
They are not well.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They even don't know how to clean up the family.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Mother.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't want to save them.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But she is...

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There is no way to do this.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There is a rule in the capital.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
A woman's crime is not a crime of killing her husband and son.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Before the interrogation,

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
she can be taken back to the house by husband or wife.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
After hearing the rumors,

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
the power of the prime minister is also a key to the capital.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Li'er hasn't been married yet.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
She will be taken back by our family.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I will give the prime minister a pair of shoes tomorrow.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Why do you use husband's intelligence?

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
For Dingzhou, you have been working for a long time.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's better for a woman from Jiang family to be out.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What you mean is...

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Don't worry.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I will take Li'er back.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Duke Su,

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
the three Dingzhu made me stay calm.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But I still can't stay calm.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I guessed it.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But I didn't guess you would be so cruel.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Aren't you a very stubborn man?

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You are not a bad man?

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm tired.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm tired.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Are you tired?

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm tired.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll rest here for a while.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I heard you are a phoenix.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You didn't even ask me a word.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Aren't you afraid that His Majesty will punish you?

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You have been asking me since I came in.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Aren't you tired?

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm tired too.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
When the ancient times came,

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
you were so kind.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You forced them to kill you.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You were too stubborn.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's not the first time.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Actually, there is no need for that.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Duke Su,

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
are you with Han Yu?

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Han Yu.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Han Yu.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Han Yu.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Han Yu.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Han Yu.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If I give you a chance,

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
will you knock down the Deng Wengu

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
in front of the gate of Chang'an?

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I think you will.

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
All right.

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm done.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You're done?

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes.

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Didn't you finish what you were going to say?

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm leaving.

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can rest.

109
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm leaving.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This place shouldn't be where you were born.

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
As the wife of the Central Commandery,

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
you shouldn't be a coward.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't be so harsh on me.

114
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I've been in the Jiang family for more than ten years.

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can't see the things in the house,

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
but I've heard a lot.

117
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Now my daughter is here.

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Can't I even ask her a question?

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If you just want to go in and see the people,

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll definitely ask her.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But she's here today to take away the criminal.

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This is a very bad situation for me.

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I only want to ask you two things.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
First,

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
did the judge of the court

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
make a law on whether the criminal is Da Yan?

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Of course.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Second,

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
women are guilty.

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If it's not a crime to kill a man,

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
before the trial,

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you can take your husband or your wife

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
back to the house to observe the case.

134
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Listen to the rumors.

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Is this law

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
from my Da Yan?

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Well...

138
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes.

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If so,

140
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
why shouldn't I take this case?

141
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I came here today

142
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
to take my daughter away.

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I want to see

144
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
who dares to stop me.

145
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Guards.

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes.

147
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Bring the second wife here.

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Then I'll wait here.

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Duke Su.

151
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Duke Su.

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What's wrong?

153
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The court is asking us to leave the criminal to me.

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We'll bring him out now.

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Duke Su,

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
the suspect is here.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Madam Jiang,

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
according to Da Yan's law,

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
the criminal will leave you

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to observe the court.

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If there is a death penalty,

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
you can take the case.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Thank you, Duke Su.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll leave the case to you.

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll leave it to you.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll leave it to you.

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll leave it to you.

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll leave it to you.

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll leave it to you.

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you, Duke Zhou.

171
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't move.

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Follow me.

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Why is Mother here?

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't know why you came back to Lu Yang

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
to give the case to the magistrate.

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But I know

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
your father did this for your sake.

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He didn't know how much he wasted.

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you have any family

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
other than your father?

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
As your mother,

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I can't ignore your father

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and his honor.

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
When you return to Jiang,

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you and your father

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
will have to explain to Madam.

187
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Mother,

188
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'll teach you a lesson.

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Mother,

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Li'er is back.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's good that you're back.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Have a seat.

193
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Do you know why your father

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
doesn't want to see you?

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I think he has broken his heart

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
for me.

197
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Li'er was so angry

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
that he must be angry

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
with me.

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You and the Xie family

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
are not close to each other.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
How could you

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
get involved in such a case?

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You even brought so many

205
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
villagers back to the capital.

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You didn't have to

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
risk your own life

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
to get involved in the Jiang family.

209
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The daughter of the magistrate,

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Consort Xue,

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
she is my savior.

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
When Li'er was in the Zhengyu Hall,

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the Hall Leader was treated badly.

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
She almost died.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Consort Xue saved her grandson and daughter.

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Is that true?

217
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I went to Lu Yang this time.

218
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Besides the visitation,

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I also wanted to see my savior.

220
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I was in a bad mood.

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I couldn't do anything

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
because my father was in trouble.

223
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
My dear daughter,

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
you should repay me.

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I won't stop you.

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Is that true?

227
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I know.

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm from the Jiang family.

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
My actions

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
are all related to the Jiang family.

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So I didn't mean to give up.

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I was pregnant

233
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
because I wanted to see my savior.

234
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But after I got pregnant,

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I found out that

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
the new magistrate

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
was a man of no means.

238
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
He was a man of no means.

239
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You didn't see that

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
the pregnant woman was pregnant.

241
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
She was pregnant.

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The villagers

243
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
didn't dare to leave the house.

244
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
How could she be so sad?

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Mother,

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
you told me

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
that the family of the ancestral father

248
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
was pregnant.

249
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You were a man of no means.

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You were loyal

251
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and you weren't being honest.

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Li Er is a man of no means.

253
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I couldn't do anything

254
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,920
to see those people

255
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,000
who were wronged.

256
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You are so angry.

257
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Mother was very happy.

258
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But your brother told your father

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
to take care of her.

260
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You didn't have to

261
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
let yourself be put into danger.

262
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Li Er was forced to have a child.

263
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I just told you

264
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
that the new magistrate of Huai Xiang

265
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He is from the Li family.

266
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What?

267
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Lu Yang, in the past,

268
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
someone has been trying to poison the Ye family.

269
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I told my father through the letter.

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And I found the clue in Lu Yang.

271
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There are only eight or nine of them in the back of the family.

272
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Then you will be the criminal.

273
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Since ancient times, the Ye family has been in a lot of trouble.

274
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They can only talk about it.

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I heard that if they can't turn the case over,

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
they will be killed.

277
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Grandmother, Xue Huaiyun,

278
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I have already taken the clue.

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The case is chaotic.

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's out of the question.

281
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Moreover, if Xue Xianlin has a crime,

282
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
how can there be so many people

283
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
to sue me together?

284
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Moreover, the new letter that Li family supports

285
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
is hard to bear for eight years.

286
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
People have already been hurt by it.

287
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I will tell your father about this.

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Thank you, Grandmother.

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What?

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The letter of Huaiyun is really from the Li family?

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It won't be wrong.

292
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Li family and Jiang family are always together.

293
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
These years, Li family has been in the court

294
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and has been in the court.

295
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If we Jiang family are not as good as Wang Xi,

296
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
you should know this better than anyone else.

297
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Now Li family has been out of hand.

298
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Can we still ignore it?

299
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
No wonder Li Zhongnan wrote the letter himself.

300
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
He will only leave the dead.

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You finally understand.

302
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
If Xue Huaiyun really turns the case over,

303
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
he will be able to hurt the Rui family.

304
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But Li Zhongnan will also hate us.

305
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Once there is a chance in the future,

306
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
he will be madly reprimanded.

307
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You just don't do anything.

308
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He doesn't hate us anymore.

309
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Now they are the ones who are out of hand.

310
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
His hands are already deep into the Ye family.

311
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What kind of person is the Ye family?

312
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's our family.

313
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
If we don't do anything,

314
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
how will the world see us?

315
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Li family is doing business with a single shot of blood.

316
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
In Chang'anmen,

317
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
it seems that Lu Mang and His Majesty are going to kill themselves.

318
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This means His Majesty also found out

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
that Xue Huaiyun's case is not normal.

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This is not a chance for us to counterattack.

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Now that Shuren has taken Li back,

322
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
we have nothing to withdraw.

323
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's a deal.

324
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
We should communicate with Li family

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and give Li family a chance.

326
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You are back.

327
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm back.

328
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm back.

329
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm back.

330
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You broke the air?

331
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Your Highness, what do you mean?

332
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I thought you came back late

333
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
to visit the prison of the Dalit family

334
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
to see how the Jiangli who looks like your late wife

335
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
with a long and thin hair is.

336
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Stop.

337
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Why are you so angry?

338
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let me see which one is angry.

339
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm jealous of you.

340
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You like the color of the suit, right?

341
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That's my cup of tea.

342
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Okay.

343
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll choose the red one.

344
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll wear it tomorrow

345
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
to meet the second wife.

346
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What will you do tomorrow?

347
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Of course, I'll go to the water.

348
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I hope you won't be angry and make trouble.

349
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll be angry and make trouble.

350
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Shen Yurong, I've been with you for a long time.

351
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Please turn around and become your father.

352
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I've always wanted to know

353
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
if I had given you another chance,

354
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
would you have buried Consort Xue or killed me?

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'd rather die in your hands.

356
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Second wife.

357
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Why didn't Jiang Yuanbai come with you?

358
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It seems that he's used to living in the prison of the Dalit family.

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He's afraid of being raised by others.

360
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I think you're the Prime Minister.

361
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm so worried that you're out of prison now.

362
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The Central Secretary is always patient.

363
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I didn't expect his daughter to be so brave.

364
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Now, the moon is getting bigger.

365
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's really surprising.

366
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You're so kind.

367
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It seems that Second wife is the most mature.

368
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Is it really decided to leave me today?

369
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So there's nothing to worry about.

370
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What are you thinking?

371
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What do you think I know?

372
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll tell you, Second wife.

373
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't know anything about the world.

374
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You want to be so naive in front of me,

375
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and be so naive in front of me.

376
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Your father wouldn't do that.

377
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You're a wild girl.

378
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You're not enough to think.

379
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Aren't you afraid that you'll die in the end?

380
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Prime Minister Li wants to remind me that

381
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm not good enough to force you.

382
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Second wife is so bold.

383
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
She's more brave than my two son who doesn't want to be a big wife.

384
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't know if I can be so bold.

385
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm afraid that I can't change anything after the trial.

386
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm afraid that I'll have to be so bold.

387
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Prime Minister Li.

388
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Prime Minister Su, you're early.

389
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm from Jiangcaizhan.

390
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I know clearly that Prime Minister Li is calling you Second wife.

391
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Second wife even called me a coward.

392
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Second wife, this is a military law.

394
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's not clear what you're going to do.

395
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
In the future, you'll be so mature

396
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
in front of an old minister like Prime Minister Li.

397
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You're so mature.

398
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm getting a little bit of a lesson.

399
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Prime Minister Su, you're so thoughtful.

400
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm not.

401
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But you know better than Prime Minister Li how to deal with people.

402
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't know what happened to Yu'an today.

403
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Second wife is still mature now.

404
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But I hope that after the case,

405
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
she can still laugh like now.

406
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Goodbye.

407
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Thank you for your consideration for me today.

408
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's not a big deal for you.

409
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You can't say that.

410
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
At least I can see that Li Zhongnan is prepared.

411
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Since that's the case,

412
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I have something to tell you in advance.

413
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Fengqin Song, I'm not going to have a meal with you.

414
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If Prime Minister Su says so,

415
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'll have to put my credit on the line.

416
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Recently, in Beikun,

417
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
you've made Feng Bu's handkerchief.

418
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I've sealed it.

419
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Your embroidery is very good.

420
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
My embroidery is not as good as the old embroidery on the cloth.

421
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
At first, I didn't dare to put on the needle.

422
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I was afraid that I'd be damaged.

423
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You know my identity.

424
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Prime Minister Su's father, General Xiao,

425
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
is my general.

426
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He's been a good man for his whole life.

427
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
He's been a strong man with his wife.

428
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He's also a very good and compatible woman.

429
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What about your father?

430
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
How about me?

431
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Prime Minister Jiang.

432
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Prime Minister Jiang is a man of his own.

433
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
He loves people like this.

434
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I have something to say to my daughter.

435
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Father.

436
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You're suffering.

437
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I thought that you wouldn't forgive me.

438
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You're my daughter.

439
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You've already told me your idea.

440
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Don't be afraid.

441
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'll do anything for you.

442
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Thank you, Father.

443
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
His Majesty is here.

444
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I, Gong Xing Sheng An.

445
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Please rise.

446
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

447
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The county magistrate of Huai Xiang, Xue Huaiyuan,

448
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
is in a state of silence.

449
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The case of the Zhongfu case is filed by the governor.

450
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The case is filed by the governor.

451
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The county magistrate of Huai Xiang,

452
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
is in a state of silence.

453
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
His Majesty is in a state of silence.

454
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He's in a state of silence.

455
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
He's in a state of silence.

456
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The governor of the state of Dali Temple,

457
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
is in a state of silence.

458
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The court is adjourned.

459
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
His Majesty is in a state of silence.

460
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Zhou Qing.

461
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Let's begin.

462
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm here to tell you

463
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
to tell the second mother.

464
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Tell the second mother.

465
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Tell the second mother.

466
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

467
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Rise.

468
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

469
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Second mother.

470
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You brought the people of Huai Xiang to the capital.

471
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But you came here to

472
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
arrest Xue Huaiyuan and the case of the Zhongfu case.

473
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I came back to Dali Temple.

474
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Half a year ago,

475
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
the county magistrate of Huai Xiang, Xue Huaiyuan,

476
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
was arrested by the county official and was arrested by Feng Yutang.

477
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
He was arrested for murder.

478
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
He was sentenced to death and sentenced to death.

479
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
He was sentenced to death.

480
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
My daughter was a guard of Huai Xiang.

481
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
She was somehow known by others.

482
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
As far as I know,

483
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
you were the first day of the interrogation

484
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
in Huai Xiang County.

485
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You were forced to take the criminal away.

486
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Do you agree with that?

487
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yes.

488
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Do you know

489
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
that the crime of breaking into the county magistrate's prison

490
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
is a crime?

491
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I know.

492
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
This is a good idea.

493
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
But if not,

494
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
the fate of Xue Huaiyuan

495
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
will never see the day

496
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
when the suffering of Huai Xiang

497
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
will be a burden to me.

498
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But I would like to ask Your Majesty and the State of Zhu

499
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
to make the decision

500
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
before I commit the crime.

501
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Who was the judge

502
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
who was the judge of Xue Huaiyuan?

503
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
The judge of the case.

504
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I remember

505
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
the case was not complicated.

506
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Xue Huaiyuan's house

507
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
was surrounded by

508
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
10 boxes of dirty silver

509
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and 5000 soldiers.

510
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
The money was a private account.

511
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
In addition,

512
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
the evidence of the arrest of Feng Yutang

513
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and the evidence of the human rights

514
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
were not

515
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
the strange place

516
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
that Miss Jiang Er said.

517
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Miss Jiang Er

518
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
went to Huai Xiang personally.

519
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It seems that

520
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
she has exposed

521
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
the inside of the unknown.

522
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
She was the criminal.

523
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Before the case,

524
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
please punish Miss Jiang Er

525
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
for her own wrongdoing.

526
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I have no evidence.

527
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
How dare you!

528
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Since you have no new evidence,

529
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
you still dare to seduce the people

530
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
who are unwilling to come to the capital

531
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
to take the capital and return to the capital

532
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
to thank Your Majesty.

533
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Miss Jiang Er,

534
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
you have no evidence.

535
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I have not finished my words.

536
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Why are you so anxious?

537
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Since I can't bear the evidence,

538
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I will ask another favor.

539
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Your Majesty,

540
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I have been busy with the investigation.

541
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I brought Huai Xiang's people to Chang'an

542
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
to knock on the door.

543
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I didn't ask for the punishment

544
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
of Xue Huaiyuan.

545
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I just want Your Majesty to be punished.

546
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
What is this?

547
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
What is this?

548
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
What is this?

549
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
What is this?

550
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Father!

551
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Punish?

552
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
What is this?

553
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Everyone knows

554
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
that Huai Xiang is the county magistrate of Xue Huaiyuan.

555
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
He is a criminal.

556
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
The evidence is accurate.

557
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
He is the assistant of the court.

558
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
His Majesty is very kind.

559
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
A little county magistrate of Huai Xiang

560
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
dares to be so bold.

561
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
He is a criminal.

562
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
He is not a criminal.

563
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I think

564
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
he should be punished

565
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
for his crimes.

566
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's not a crime.

567
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's not a crime.

568
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I can't take the new evidence.

569
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I can only admit defeat.

570
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Huai Xiang's county magistrate, Xue Huaiyuan,

571
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
is a official.

572
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
He is the official of my aunt's family.

573
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
He has been in Huai Xiang for ten years.

574
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
He was found out last year.

575
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The crime is only 5,000 taels.

576
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Ten years.

577
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
5,000 taels.

578
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
This is not right.

579
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
What is wrong?

580
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
In the past ten years,

581
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
he is a good official.

582
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Or

583
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
he is not a good official.

584
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Or he colluded with others.

585
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
He is a dirty man.

586
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
The last 5,000 taels

587
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
is just a token.

588
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Where did he get the more dirty money?

589
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
The Ministry of Justice

590
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
didn't check it.

591
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
The county magistrate didn't have the money.

592
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Maybe he did the crime

593
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
with the military code.

594
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
In this way,

595
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
he has the risk of treason.

596
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The Ministry of Justice

597
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
killed him without hesitation.

598
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
He is not afraid of the crime.

599
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Of course he is investigating.

600
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But it's not new

601
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
to investigate this case.

602
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
What should we do?

603
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That's the reason.

604
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I will take Huai Xiang's people to the capital.

605
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Please change the witness.

606
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yes.

607
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Send the witness.

608
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yes.

609
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Kneel.

610
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
About the county magistrate

611
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
and Xue Huai Yuan,

612
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
what do you want to say?

613
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Your Majesty,

614
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I don't know

615
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
the county magistrate and Xue Huai Yuan.

616
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I only know...

617
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Take out the words.

618
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I only know

619
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
if it's not because of Xue County magistrate,

620
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
the mother and daughter

621
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,320
can only be bullied and

622
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,000
have no place to live.

623
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
When I was killed by my husband,

624
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I brought the child alone.

625
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
In our most difficult times,

626
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Xue County magistrate

627
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
even made up his own way

628
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
to make up for us.

629
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
He Jun,

630
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
help him to clean up.

631
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
If anyone dares to bully him,

632
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
just punish him in a safe way.

633
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes.

634
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Ping An,

635
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
thank the county magistrate.

636
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Hurry up.

637
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Thank uncle Xue.

638
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
All right.

639
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's all right.

640
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
No one will dare to bully you anymore.

641
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
If it wasn't for the county magistrate's help,

642
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I might have

643
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
lost my temper.

644
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I was poor at that time.

645
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I couldn't afford to study.

646
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I was forced to pay the tuition fee

647
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
to the county magistrate.

648
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I asked the county magistrate to return to the school

649
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and get the embroidery.

650
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Gu Da,

651
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
sign the letter.

652
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Sign it from my letter.

653
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yes.

654
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Son.

655
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I can read again.

656
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yes.

657
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
They said

658
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
the pork from the villagers

659
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
will be killed by the caravan.

660
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
If there's no county magistrate,

661
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
the village head would be taken away by me.

662
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Stop it.

663
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I even wanted to give the money to the county magistrate.

664
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But he didn't want it.

665
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Your Majesty,

666
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
please investigate the situation.

667
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The county magistrate

668
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,920
can't do anything

669
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,000
that is too much.

670
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
The county magistrate knows a good person.

671
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yes.

672
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
The county magistrate knows a good person.

673
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The county magistrate knows a good person.

674
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The county magistrate knows a good person.

675
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The county magistrate knows a good person.

676
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
He wouldn't do that.

677
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Yes.

678
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Just say it.

679
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
If you want to buy it,

680
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
let these people

681
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
say some good words for the officials.

682
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It's not hard to do that.

683
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Duke Zhou,

684
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
be careful.

685
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The county magistrate mentioned that

686
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
the people in the house

687
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
would do this

688
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
to help the people.

689
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
This person

690
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
must be bought

691
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
and talked about.

692
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Please send the person

693
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
to the court.

694
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Send the person to the court.

695
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
That person.

696
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I will borrow some money.

697
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Right.

698
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Go.

699
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
thermal water from the middle of the road

700
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
made by General Xu?

701
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's made out of thermal water that year.

702
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It means that the county magistrate

703
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,200
Long live the emperor!

704
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,160
It sounds so touching.

705
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,760
I remember

706
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,280
the Qing Zhou Talisman case three years ago.

707
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,400
The Talisman case was huge.

708
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,080
But it was used as a public office.

709
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,040
When the Cha Chao family was established,

710
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,400
there were countless people.

711
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,000
Just like the people

712
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,440
who were pleading for their land.

713
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,720
The case of the Dalit family

714
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,520
was handled by the Prime Minister.

715
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,600
Don't you forget it?

716
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,960
We're all here.

717
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,880
As the Prime Minister said,

718
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,200
most of the land is used for the people.

719
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,680
Most of it is used for the land.

720
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,200
The Zhou family

721
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,680
has such a good view.

722
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,760
Feng Yutang is one of them.

723
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,560
Feng Yutang

724
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,600
has been in the family for six months.

725
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,840
He also made a home for himself.

726
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,440
His family is rich and wealthy.

727
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,000
They are so busy.

728
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,800
Xue Huaiyuan has been in the family for ten years.

729
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,200
He should have more family assets.

730
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,440
Xue Huaiyuan was in the family for six months.

731
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,760
His family is now in the government.

732
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,880
I request the Prime Minister

733
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,440
to announce the family assets of the Cha Chao family

734
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,480
and Feng family.

735
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,920
Let's have a look.

736
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,400
Compared with Feng Yutang,

737
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,840
Xue Huaiyuan is not a bad person.

738
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,960
Please, the Prime Minister

739
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,440
will make two family assets.

740
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,960
The Yuan Huaixiang County Magistrate Xue Huaiyuan

741
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,640
has no private residence and no property.

742
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,800
The house is full of dirty money.

743
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,880
The total property of Cha Chao family is 5,000 taels.

744
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,760
The county magistrate Feng Yutang

745
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,680
has 40 houses in the family.

746
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,000
All of them are still in the family.

747
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,480
The house is full of money.

748
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,480
The total property is 20,000 taels.

749
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,000
That's not bad.

750
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,880
It's 20,000 taels.

751
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,640
It's not bad.

752
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,560
It's 20,000 taels.

753
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,640
It's 5,000 taels.

754
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,160
In this way,

755
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,920
the county magistrate Xue Huaiyuan

756
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,960
has no private residence and no property.

757
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
He has only 5,000 taels.

758
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,360
He has made money

759
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,720
and installed a box.

760
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,240
He has to put it in his own house

761
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,520
and wait for the new department to collect it.

762
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,280
He has made such a good deal.

763
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,080
He is a good man.

764
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,840
He is very clever.

765
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,320
No matter how much he is greedy,

766
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,080
no matter how he is greedy,

767
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,640
he is always greedy.

768
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,280
Please send the witness to the court.

769
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
Send the witness.

770
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,200
Your Majesty,

771
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,760
founded by the county magistrate Xue,

772
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,000
on how can he do what he wants?

773
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,120
It would take

774
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
for the whole army

775
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,440
to puppy his crew members,

776
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,280
in their own harsh Huntingd myself!

777
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,860
It's aktenuzshotsizi Venice Wire operating.

778
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,880
It can't be any otherchu

779
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,560
to catch up the spy in the Police Department.

780
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,880
The Us Alors

781
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Download apps

782
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,660
Online

783
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,760
Are you a minor field editor?

784
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,740
You must know

785
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,840
that he is very, very dangerous on this road.

786
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,920
Here comes the coronical ge Scottish asynchronous Clarish.

787
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,440
We would kill you.

788
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,040
As the

789
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,440
saying goes,

790
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,040
if you dare to do as a lie,

791
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,720
just get out of the prison!

792
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,600
I would let you stand alone and do as a lie.

793
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,200
If you dare to do as a lie,

794
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,840
let us keep you silent.

795
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:14,200
We would

796
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,320
definite truth.

797
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,420
As what their second wife said,

798
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,260
let's invite more than four million teachers to visit.

799
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,280
Wait.

800
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,640
Jiang Li,

801
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,160
continue.

802
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,280
I would like to Ruby to forgive me,

803
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,400
for being so day-damn.

804
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
Despite the disaster problem,

805
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,200
every word is like water.

806
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,240
The Lianch Contract is useless.

807
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
He is a man of great ambition.

808
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,240
He is as pure as water.

809
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,240
He is a man of great ambition.

810
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
He is a man of great ambition.

811
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
There is no such a man in the world.

812
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
So he must have more

813
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
unruly enemies and traitors

814
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
among people.

815
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,240
Where did he go

816
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
among the people?

817
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,240
He went to the water.

818
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,240
He saw the silence.

819
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
He saw the silence.

820
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,440
He is going to use the power of the

821
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,240
thousands of mothers in Liang Tian

822
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
when he was in the capital.

823
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
He is so free.

824
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,240
He is shameless.

825
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
He is a man of great ambition.

826
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
The crime of Xue Huaiyuan

827
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
is indeed unforgivable.

828
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
I beg Your Majesty

829
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
to punish Xue Huaiyuan

830
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,240
with the power of the thousands of mothers.

831
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
So to speak,

832
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
Xue Huaiyuan is innocent

833
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
and has no power.

834
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,240
I am willing to

835
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,240
take Huaixiang to the palace

836
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,240
with the power of Xue Huaiyuan.

837
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Xue Huaiyuan is also a witness.

838
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,240
I beg Your Majesty

839
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,240
to see the appearance of the current leader.

840
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
Yes.

841
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Tell Xue Huaiyuan.

842
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
Your Majesty.

843
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,240
This person is the current leader of Huaixiang, Xue Huaiyuan.

844
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,240
He was imprisoned in the prison

845
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,240
by Feng Yutang

846
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,240
and was tortured for hundreds of times.

847
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,240
Now you are a man of God.

848
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
You are a man of the Qing Ming and the Central officials.

849
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
Now you are in such a terrible situation.

850
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Once this is out,

851
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,240
how many officials and officials

852
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
will be in the world?

853
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,240
How many people

854
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,240
will be willing to be loyal and loyal to Your Majesty?

855
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
How dare you!

856
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
How dare you question Your Majesty!

857
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
Jiang Erniang's words

858
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,240
are so close to my mother.

859
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,240
She is a good person.

860
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
She is a loyal and loyal person.

861
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,240
Although Jiang Erniang said it out loud,

862
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
it sounds reasonable.

863
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,240
Otherwise, I will be imprisoned in the Central officials' prison.

864
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,240
I will not be able to take the country.

865
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
Duke Su is right.

866
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
I am not a person who can't be heard.

867
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
Jiang Qin,

868
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
you are a good girl.

869
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
You are a man of the Qing Ming and the Central officials.

870
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,240
You are imprisoned in the Central officials' prison.

871
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
Now you are in such a terrible situation.

872
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
This is my fault.

873
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,240
It is also the loss of Da Yan.

874
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,240
We can all be guilty.

875
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,240
Rise.

876
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,240
Wei Qian.

877
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
You are wrong.

878
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,240
You are guilty.

879
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,240
I am guilty.

880
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
I am guilty.

881
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
I don't know the fate of the emperor.

882
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
There is a person like Feng Yutang

883
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,240
who is loyal and loyal to the Central officials.

884
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Zhu Dezhao,

885
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,240
I order you to investigate the case of Xue Huaiyuan.

886
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,240
You are involved in the murder of Xue Huaiyuan.

887
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,240
I will not take the case.

888
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

889
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
Jiang Li,

890
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,240
you are brave and have a plan.

891
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
Let me see it again.

892
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

893
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Rise.

894
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,240
The internal information of Xue Huaiyuan's case has been investigated.

895
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Jiang Erniang asked for it.

896
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,240
The State of Zhou has been unidentified.

897
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,240
Your Majesty,

898
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,240
my daughter is indeed innocent.

899
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,240
But after hearing the truth about Xue Huaiyuan's case,

900
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
I

901
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,240
can't bear to know the truth about her.

902
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,240
I am so worried.

903
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,240
It's not the difficulty of me.

904
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,240
It's the difficulty of the court.

905
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,240
Although my daughter made a big mistake,

906
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,240
she saved me.

907
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,240
I can't save her.

908
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,240
I am guilty

909
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,240
of the crime of the court.

910
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,240
I am guilty.

911
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,240
We are traitors.

912
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
We are traitors.

913
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
We are traitors.

914
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,240
We are traitors.

915
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
We are traitors.

916
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,240
We are traitors.

917
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,240
We are traitors.

918
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,640
We will not be disobeyed.

919
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,840
Zhou Duozhou, what do you say?

920
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,440
Your Majesty, since Xue Huanyuan has a case,

921
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,840
but he has a grudge against you,

922
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,240
Xue Huanyuan is not guilty.

923
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,040
So, if you are to take the case,

924
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
it will be no use.

925
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
It's reasonable.

926
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,440
General, I am sorry for your innocence.

927
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,240
You can return to the country today.

928
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

929
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
Rise.

930
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

931
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,640
Is Xue Huanyuan a family member?

932
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,840
I want to serve her.

933
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,440
Xue Huanyuan has a son and a daughter.

934
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,840
As far as I know,

935
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,040
Xue Zhao was killed by bandits last year.

936
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
What about Xue Fangfei?

937
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,640
She is the royal wife of Shen Xueshi.

938
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,640
What kind of child is she?

939
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,640
What kind of child is she?

940
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
As far as I know,

941
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,640
the person who killed her was a spy.

942
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,640
She was wrongly accused.

943
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,640
Now, she is killed by bandits.

944
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,640
She will remember it and be punished.

945
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,640
Father.

946
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,640
Father.

947
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,640
Father.

948
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
You are wrong.

949
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
Senior Ye.

950
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Senior Xue.

951
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,640
Are you all right?

952
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
I'm fine.

953
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,640
Senior Xue.

954
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
I'm fine.

955
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,640
I'm fine.

956
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,640
Senior Shen, you are wrongly accused.

957
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,640
You are wrongly accused with Senior Xue.

958
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,640
You are wrongly accused.

959
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,640
I'm sorry.

960
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,640
You haven't seen Xue Xielin for a long time.

961
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,640
I'm afraid she can't recognize you.

962
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,640
Chou.

963
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,640
Xue Xielin is shocked.

964
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Can I take her back to rest?

965
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,640
Leave.

966
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,640
Who wrote this?

967
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,640
It's quite unique.

968
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
How can you say that?

969
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,640
She is greedy.

970
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,640
She is a woman.

971
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,640
She is a son.

972
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,640
She is dead.

973
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
She is a woman.

974
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,640
She is a woman.

975
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,640
She is a woman.

976
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,640
She is a woman.

977
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
She is a woman.

978
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
What?

979
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
She is a woman.

980
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,640
She is a woman.

981
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
A woman?

982
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,640
Is Senior Xue a woman?

983
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,640
She is a woman.

984
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,640
It's not certain.

985
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,640
Duke Su is always bold.

986
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,640
He dares to say anything.

987
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
Duke Su,

988
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,640
I'll leave it to you.

989
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,640
Let's find out the truth of the Xue family.

990
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,640
Give Xue family a light heart.

991
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,640
It's better for you to make Shen Xueshi feel at ease.

992
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

993
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,640
It's wonderful.

994
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,640
It's really wonderful.

995
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,640
Such a wonderful arrangement.

996
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
Why don't you call me?

997
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,640
The investigation is not a game.

998
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,640
Why are you here?

999
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,640
Of course, there is an important report.

1000
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,640
The second wife of Jiang family can speak well.

1001
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,640
She finally turned over the case of the Xue family.

1002
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,640
Unfortunately, Your Majesty,

1003
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,640
while being framed by the late emperor for the sake of the late emperor,

1004
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,640
did you think

1005
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,640
that you were also played by someone as a donkey?

1006
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
Wanning,

1007
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,640
don't say that.

1008
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,640
It's a coincidence.

1009
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,640
I heard that

1010
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,640
the wife of Shen Xueshi

1011
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,640
was the first talent in Huai Xiang.

1012
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,640
I was curious.

1013
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,640
I went there and saw.

1014
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,640
Indeed,

1015
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,640
the appearance of Mrs. Shen is unique.

1016
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,640
There is little in the world.

1017
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,640
So when I saw the second wife of Jiang family,

1018
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,640
I was surprised.

1019
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,640
Because she looks the same as the Xue family.

1020
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,640
I'm sorry.

1021
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,640
I'm sorry.

1022
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,640
I'm sorry.

1023
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,640
I'm sorry.

1024
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,640
I'm sorry.

1025
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,640
I'm sorry.
