1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly stop the crying of the life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Waiting for the spring to return to the earth

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 1

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Qin Kuang

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hurry up

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The snow is falling

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Shen Yurong

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Princess

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So all this is related to you

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do you know what the consequences are?

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What consequences?

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
They've killed people

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's right

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Walk up so that no one will suspect you

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hurry up

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm not eating

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hurry up

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hurry up

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What are you doing?

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You can't understand

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Beat him

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't hit him

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Beat him

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Beat him

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let me go

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Beat him

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Beat him

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't beat him

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He's not that old

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He's just a real man

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You two, get back to the car

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Go

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I haven't eaten yet

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What are you looking at?

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Go

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You all understand

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're a man of the past

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're a man of the future

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You can't see

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hurry up

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hurry up

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Bear with it

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Do you think we'll die here?

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't talk nonsense

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We'll be fine

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Who is it?

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The construction said

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We can wipe the medicine and go back

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't come over

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Help me

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Brother Gu

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Gu'er

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's me

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Xue...

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Xue...

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Xue...

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's me

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're really Xue...

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm here to save you

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You're tired

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But...

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But the bed is full

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm here to save you

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're tired

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But...

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But the bed is full

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're like an accident

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How could it be?

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is a long story

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have a new identity

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
My name is Jiang Li

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Jiang Li?

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
In front of the outsiders

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't change my name

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Get out first

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll tell you the details

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's my third eye

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's not easy to escape

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Xue, leave now

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Even if we escape

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Feng Yutang, the bastard

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
won't let us go

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes, leave now

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm not leaving

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm not leaving

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't worry

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Feng Yutang won't talk for two days

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Since I'm here

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I must take you out

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's go there

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's see if anyone comes out

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't be afraid

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Someone's coming

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let me go

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Be honest

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Do your work

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
My brother said it

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Be quick

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What's wrong with you?

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Do your work

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Wait for me

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What's wrong?

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's wrong?

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're so mean

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No, no

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Where's he?

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He's looking at us

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Who's there?

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Who's there?

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Who's there?

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Li Yadou

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We've made up our mind

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're so brave to come to save us

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Why don't we go out?

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He Jun and Peng Xiao are here too

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He Jun and Peng Xiao are still alive

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll call them out

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Be careful

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't let them in

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't worry

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Let's go

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Hurry up

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hurry up

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hurry up

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hurry up

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This way

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
After dinner

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
the guards will change their seats

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
OK

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We'll take this opportunity

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
to get out with Peng Xiao and He Jun

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's it

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Brother

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He Jun and Peng Xiao are over there

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's go

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Where are you?

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's time to explain

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's go

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's go

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Wait for your shoulder

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You're mistaken

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
As a person who was caught by you

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I need to remind you

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You're too reckless this time

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
With your intelligence

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You can wait for me

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
to sit here for a while

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and think about the rest

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's not beautiful

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Wait for your evidence

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
to collect the soldiers' horses

166
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
to cut the gold mine

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The person in the blood

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
has fallen down

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Come here

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh no

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They don't know

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
the investigation is over

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We need to go back

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Follow me

175
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hurry up

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Old man

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What's wrong?

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't worry

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They don't want to fight with them

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's right

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We four people

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
are afraid that they won't be able to recognize us

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is the treasure

184
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's the treasure

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The treasure is sleeping

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You said

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You sleep when you eat

188
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Come here

189
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What's going on?

190
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Come here

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What's going on?

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Come here

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What's going on?

194
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Back to the team

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Over there

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Help them

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Help them

198
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Master, you go first

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'll be back soon

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yes

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Go

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Go

203
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Go

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I can't even get a person

205
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I let him run away

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What's the use

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
if I want you to go to waste?

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't worry

209
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We're in the whole city

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and we're famous

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He can't escape from Huai Xiang

212
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't worry

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't worry

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Have you ever let me relax?

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Don't worry

216
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
When we searched

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
we found that

218
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
there was a letter from the outside

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
from the outside

220
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The spy

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I got you

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
here

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This is for you

224
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Great

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
ummy

226
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The king is not locked

227
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I help you

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Master

229
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,500
Why do you think

230
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,000
we won't kill each other?

231
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's been championship

232
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I want to ask

233
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I sold my old man for money.

234
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,240
But I have something I don't understand.

235
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,480
After Xue Huaiyuan died,

236
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,200
I also took you in.

237
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,560
I'm as grateful to you as he is.

238
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,560
Why did you betray me?

239
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,880
You bastard!

240
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,360
You're also compared to Xue Xianlin!

241
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,760
Come on!

242
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,440
I really thought

243
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,160
you had a point in your itchless.

244
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,200
But you even told me

245
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,480
since you had it.

246
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,040
Does Jiang Li

247
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,240
come from the Royal Consort ofpects?

248
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,680
Where is she?

249
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,120
What did you and her talk about?

250
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm just angry.

251
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Okay.

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll say it.

253
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That day,

254
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
he told me...

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Die, you bastard!

256
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
He's been here for a few days.

258
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He hasn't had any meat.

259
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I just want him to have a meal.

260
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
This old man

261
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
hasn't had a few meals in his life.

262
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I just want him to be happy.

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

That's a meg torso.

265
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,560
I'm going to get to the表島 now.

266
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,840
That's great.

267
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,620
Huh?

268
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,500
Ha ha.

269
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,360
Well,

270
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,720
Ha ha.

271
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,660
Good job.

272
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,980
You danced.

273
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,260
Chありがとうございます.

274
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,640
I love it.

275
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Retreat! Retreat!

276
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,640
Report!

277
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,740
Report! Qing Ling, the Kuang Mountain came to report.

278
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,040
They said that those Kuang Mountain people were saved by someone.

279
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,540
So, their purpose is to save the people.

280
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,940
The one upstairs, is there a letter?

281
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,940
I haven't received it yet.

282
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,940
You haven't received it?

283
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,940
You haven't received it?

284
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,940
Why haven't you received it?

285
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,340
Get lost!

286
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,340
Who sent a message?

287
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,340
He sent it.

288
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,340
A message from Fei Ke! The messenger is here.

289
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,540
Since I have been helped by someone,

290
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,740
I don't have any more worries.

291
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,340
I dare to do anything on my territory.

292
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,340
I will let you have no regrets.

293
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,340
There is a traitor! Get out of here!

294
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,340
Go!

295
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,340
Go!

296
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,340
Xiao Heng!

297
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,340
Protect Huali.

298
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,340
Yes.

299
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,260
You will be expecting a immigration.

300
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,540
You were too weak.

301
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,380
Everything changed,

302
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,020
and you still have all your money to spare.

303
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,860
What is it?

304
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,580
People need your money.

305
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,780
There's no need to rush the amount of money to continue.

306
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,860
Then why do we poisoning these people?

307
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,620
The food has my money.

308
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,460
Media companies have your money gathered and they want that,

309
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,580
It shouldn't come here.

310
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,580
Chief Commissioner.

311
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,100
My wound is t reignited.

312
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,160
I can finally try it.

313
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,260
Stop there.

314
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,660
Lower your head.

315
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,860
Does it hurt?

316
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,980
It's nothing.

317
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,980
What about you?

318
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,620
You've been knocked by a sword.

319
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,420
It's not appropriate.

320
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,900
I was also knocked by a sword.

321
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,260
A'Li,

322
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,460
you don't have to try to be strong.

323
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,620
My life is yours.

324
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,020
Did you hear what I said to you?

325
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,180
I did.

326
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,540
But it's not interesting.

327
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,140
Your big event is not over.

328
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,140
I've handled your life now.

329
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Will you agree?

330
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,740
Dealing with me,

331
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,900
Before you deal with me,

332
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,620
I'll live or die for it.

333
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,380
It's okay.

334
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,140
None of your words are rude.

335
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,220
Palaceady Su!

336
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,480
you are bold

337
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,940
to kill me,

338
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,560
with theamengess of問題.

339
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,740
Just say it.

340
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,420
If he didn't do this,

341
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,340
he himself could have killed the righteous girl.

342
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:33,900
pless

343
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,620
Long time no see

344
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,360
the meaning稱

345
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,040
Where?

346
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:50,680
is the

347
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,060
dern

348
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,100
What does it mean?

349
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,660
no Grocery

350
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,700
That's why

351
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,900
I'm just here.

352
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,900
I won't make a mess.

353
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,300
Xuanxian might still be in Feng Yutang's hands.

354
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,540
Get her the same dress.

355
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,300
Yes.

356
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,820
Don't meet each other again.

357
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,540
You can't look back.

358
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,500
Xie.

359
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,620
your father'sion catch them.

360
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,580
Have some.

361
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,760
Xie,

362
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,560
let's

363
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,560
If you want to go to Kaixuan, you should go to Kaixuan.

364
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
I really believe in Li Jin's heart.

365
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,560
What if Duke Su can kill the people who are under my control?

366
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
What if they can't?

367
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Those dead bodies of those people will be on their way back to the hospital.

368
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
Then we should get a carriage.

369
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Where are we going?

370
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,560
We'll run away like dogs.

371
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,560
We'll go back to the drugstore.

372
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
No way!

373
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,560
I even climbed here.

374
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,560
He wants me to go back and continue to be a dog.

375
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
What are you waiting for?

376
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Continue to the hospital.

377
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Continue to eat.

378
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Happiness.

379
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
Are you giving up the resistance?

380
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
There's still a reed inside.

381
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
Are youatter that we are all dead?

382
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Let's light the uproars.

383
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
Watch out for theமadi之物.

384
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,280
Interestingly, that man is already dead.

385
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,000

387

Take over my tribe

one is just one person's demeanor.

398
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,580
Slow.

399
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,040
Why are you at a rush?

400
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,100
A Li.

401
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:38,300
The danger haven't包

402
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,460
Your juvenile accelerator

Will you

404
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,280
You can also search in the data

405
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,400
They are so good.

406
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,960
They want to catch me.

407
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,720
What should I do?

408
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,320
Jiang Li.

409
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,040
Go.

410
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,240
Fuyutang,

411
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,640
a man is a big man.

412
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,840
You even took a sandbag

413
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,040
to kill me.

414
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,920
Xue.

415
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,920
It seems we all know the wrong person.

416
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,080
Your daughter

417
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,720
will not be saved.

418
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,960
My carriage is parked in the front yard.

419
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,240
And then,

420
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,160
the State Department of Su

421
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,040
uses gold to fill my carriage.

422
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,240
I will leave naturally.

423
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,120
Li.

424
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,400
But if I am on the way,

425
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,720
I will be in danger

426
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,920
and I will be scared.

427
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,480
I will not listen to you

428
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,920
if I am in danger.

429
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,520
Fuyutang, you are so good.

430
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,000
You are so brave.

431
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,920
You just want to catch someone

432
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,600
and you dare to make money.

433
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,400
I think it is not important.

434
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,840
The State Department of Su is important.

435
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,680
But it needs to be done quickly.

436
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,360
There is no time.

437
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,360
Jiang Li.

438
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,200
Li.

439
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,640
Li.

440
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,280
Li.

441
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,600
Li.

442
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,680
I promise you.

443
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,160
Liu.

444
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,080
Get in the carriage.

445
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,280
Liu.

446
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I am done.

447
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,160
Your then.

448
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,520
Li.

449
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,120
Okay.

450
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,760
Erli.

451
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,080
Erli.

452
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,880
Mr. Xue.

453
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,840
You're still the same.

454
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Do you believe me?

455
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,840
Okay.

456
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,760
I trust you.

457
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,520
Hurry.

458
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,440
You Services everyone, mustn't you?

459
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,600
It's not over yet, are you going?

460
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,400
Section Chief.

461
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,540
It's just...

462
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,060
You must go.

463
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,380
Section Chief!

464
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,780
I'm discussing the investigation with you,

465
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
You're doing well.

466
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
Thank you for your compliment.

467
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
The heart of a child running out of the world.

468
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
Aren't you fierce?

469
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,880
This sentence should be given back to you.

470
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,880
I'm not as good as you.

471
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,880
I'm just sorry for those who sold your life.

472
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,880
In the end, you didn't get a good end.

473
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Ya Po.

474
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,880
What's wrong with Ya Po?

475
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,880
You go ask the dog at the door.

476
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,880
He's a good boy.

477
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Mr. Su.

478
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Could you give him the antidote first?

479
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
He's dead.

480
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
He's too cheap.

481
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
He can't die.

482
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Such a big case.

483
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
He has to stay alive.

484
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,880
The person who will be in the execution room tomorrow will come.

485
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,880
I don't believe you dare to let me die.

486
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
You're a little bitch.

487
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
I know it's you.

488
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,880
When your father is missing tomorrow,

489
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,880
I'll send you down to accompany him.

490
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
Si Jiu.

491
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
Your head.

492
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
Come on.

493
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
This knife.

494
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
It's blood.

495
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
It's blood.

496
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
It's blood.

497
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
It's blood and blood.

498
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
You can't stop me.

499
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,880
Just wait and see if your father is dead.

500
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
This knife is Ya Po's.

501
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,880
You bitch.

502
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
I'm going to kill you.

503
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,880
This knife is the one you killed all the officials.

504
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
I'm a bastard.

505
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,880
This knife is for all the people in Huai Xiang.

506
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,880
Please spare my life.

507
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
Please spare my life.

508
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
Go to hell.

509
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
Please spare my life.

510
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,880
This knife is for you.

511
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Give him blood.

512
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,880
Leave him alive.

513
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Don't chase him.

514
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
You can't.

515
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:03,680
YOU

516
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,560
I'm afraid.

517
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,720
I'm afraid it's me.

518
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
It's me.

519
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,600
Uh…

520
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,760
It's not dangerous.

521
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,400
It's not dangerous.

522
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:37,640
It's not dangerous.

523
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,320
It's not dangerous.

524
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,440
It should be me.

525
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,960
A Ling, Ali.

526
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,440
Ali.

527
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,480
Ali is here.

528
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,800
Ali.

529
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,640
Dad, Ali is here.

530
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,400
Ali.

531
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,880
Ali is on the zuk.

532
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,360
Ali.

533
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,760
Ali.

534
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,080
Ali.

535
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,280
I am sorry

536
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,800
all our family members

537
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,480
You are my mom

538
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,200
I know

539
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,840
all those bands

540
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,320
These years

541
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,840
It's not important

542
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,760
No

543
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
It's you

544
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,480
It's you

545
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,760
This is the thing

546
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,480
I don't understand

547
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,000
All these years

548
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,120
I'm sorry.

549
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
I'm sorry.

550
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,200
I'm sorry, father.

551
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,120
I'm sorry.

552
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,800
I'm sorry.

553
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,560
I'm late.

554
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,000
I'll save you.

555
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,880
I'll do anything for you.

556
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,360
I'm sorry.

557
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,960
Those who hurt us

558
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,160
won't let go of me.

559
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,360
I won't let go of you.

560
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,840
It's okay.

561
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,680
It's okay.

562
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,280
A'Li.

563
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,800
Duke Su.

564
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,840
Why are you here?

565
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,640
I'm waiting for you.

566
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,200
What's wrong?

567
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,160
What happened?

568
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,320
Nothing serious.

569
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,040
Don't worry.

570
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
I don't want to let anyone

571
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,080
get involved in my business.

572
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,240
You guys go to find

573
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,880
the witness of the crime case.

574
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,680
When I get the news,

575
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,840
I'll come back to tell you.

576
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
Okay.

577
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,120
Look.

578
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,620

Of these aséร️ו ضò Alicia.

580
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,880
When they first hold the Bloodliper's Association,

581
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,320
they didn't even have a pulse panist on the ground.

582
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,560
Grandma bait.

583
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,400
I'll go this time.

584
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,520
I'll say all their things

585
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,440
if they don't come.

586
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
Stop making trouble!

587
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
You are not them.

588
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,280
You don't understand

589
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,080
their suffering.

590
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,280
board.

591
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,600
Have they realized

592
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,560
President Xue?

593
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,120
Are we

594
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,960

596
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,240
What's wrong?

597
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
What's wrong?

598
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
What's wrong?

599
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,120
About Xue Xianling,

600
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,120
we don't know anything.

601
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,120
We are just ordinary people.

602
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
Whatever Guan Fu said,

603
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,120
it's nothing.

604
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,120
Why don't you know?

605
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,120
Without Xue Xianling's help,

606
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,120
how could Ping An be alive now?

607
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,120
Just one day,

608
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,120
I won't let you say anything.

609
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,120
Will you accept a word from the county commander?

610
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,120
I wanted to visit Xue Xianling in the prison

611
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
in the past year.

612
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,120
I wanted to give her a dumpling.

613
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,120
But they took my Ping An

614
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
in the blink of an eye.

615
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,120
Look at her.

616
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120
What does she look like?

617
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,120
I really only have Ping An.

618
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,120
Feng Yutang is dead.

619
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
Don't be afraid.

620
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,120
We are all sisters.

621
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
I'm begging you.

622
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,120
Let us live a peaceful life.

623
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
I...

624
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,120
I'm sorry, Xue Xianling.

625
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
I'm sorry, Xue Xianling.

626
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
It's not good.

627
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,120
It's not good.

628
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,120
You are so cruel.

629
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,120
I'm a spy today.

630
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,120
What did your mother say?

631
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,120
You are a fool.

632
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Enough.

633
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Don't you want to

634
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,120
punish Xue Xianling?

635
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,120
I knew Xue Xianling was guilty.

636
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,120
I wrote the letter at the first time.

637
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,120
But that new county commander

638
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
couldn't even get off the ground

639
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,120
after beating my mother for months.

640
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Feng Yutang is dead.

641
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,120
Why are you still afraid of him?

642
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,120
We are just ordinary people.

643
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,120
It's enough to live our own life.

644
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,120
Xue Xianling's peace and quiet.

645
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,120
Wenxuan

646
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,120
can only be reported next life.

647
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
Chang, if you don't go,

648
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,120
no one will dare to stand up.

649
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,120
When I was in Xue Xianling's house,

650
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,120
I went there.

651
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,120
What happened?

652
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,120
They blinded me.

653
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,120
I didn't want to lose another one.

654
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,120
We all went to the Xijia.

655
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,120
Zhang Tufu, Dai Yun, Mo Wenxuan,

656
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,120
they all...

657
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,120
I know.

658
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,120
You three go back first.

659
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
Thank you.

660
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,120
How about

661
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,120
we ask them for a different answer?

662
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Yes.

663
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,120
Xue Xianling is kind.

664
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,120
God will help her.

665
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,120
He will.

666
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,120
Good people will have good news.

667
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,120
Let's go.

668
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,120
Let's go.

669
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,120
Let's go.

670
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,120
Let's go.

671
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,120
Let's go.

672
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
Let's go.

673
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,120
Feng Yutang,

674
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,120
girl,

675
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,120
it's really you.

676
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,120
You're still alive.

677
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,120
Sheng,

678
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,120
my father will teach Wenxuan tomorrow.

679
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,120
I want to beg you

680
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,120
to tell my father a word.

681
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,120
Wanmen.

682
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
Sheng.

683
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,120
Sheng.

684
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,120
Sheng.

685
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Please.

686
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,120
Please.

687
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,120
Please.

688
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
Please.

689
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
Father.

690
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
Good boy.

691
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,120
Get up.

692
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,120
Don't cry.

693
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,120
They did it

694
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,120
at your hands.

695
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,120
Did they do it?

696
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
No.

697
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,120
Go back to your room.

698
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,120
My leg.

699
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,120
A'Li,

700
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,120
you were my father

701
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,120
and Shen Lu.

702
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,120
You were my father.

703
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,120
You were my father.

704
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,120
We're dead.

705
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,120
Good people

00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,120
