2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,480
I was extremelyå·¦y to send a messenger.

3
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,680
I saw someone

4
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,220
knowing how to fight against the incompetence.

5
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,720
Fu Jun.

6
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,160
Fu Jun...

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,640
Who are you?

8
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,280
My wife.

9
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,640
My wife.

10
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,920
Go away.

11
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,200
Let me go.

12
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,720
You bitch.

13
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,520
I didn't...

14
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,880
Li.

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,280
You shameless bitch.

16
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,240
Li.

17
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,040
Li.

18
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,520
Li.

19
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,480
Honey.

20
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,400
You are here at last.

21
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,860
Someone framed me.

22
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,600
Mother and sister mistook me.

23
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,600
We have been married for years.

24
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
My dear, you...

25
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
You don't believe me anymore?

26
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
I'll take you away.

27
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
I'll take you away.

28
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I'll take you away.

29
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
I'll take you away.

30
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I'll take you away.

31
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Do you know that my Wulin family...

32
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Who did this?

33
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Was it you?

34
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Or your mother?

35
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Or your sister?

36
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Or your sister?

37
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Shen Yu Rong, I'm not a greedy person.

38
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
You've been cultivating trees.

39
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I'm a poor woman.

40
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
But why are you so stubborn?

41
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
You want me to understand and regret.

42
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
And you want me to die a terrible death.

43
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,600
A'Li, I don't have the blood.

44
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
She wants to kill me.

45
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Just like you want to kill an ant.

46
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Who is she?

47
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
A'Li.

48
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Close your eyes.

49
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Shen Yu Rong.

50
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Shen Yu Rong, you're so cruel to me.

51
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
You're not afraid of my father and my father.

52
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
I won't let you go.

53
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,600
You'll be reunited with them soon.

54
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Shen Yu Rong.

55
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
What's wrong with them?

56
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Xue Kong was betrayed and killed because of corruption.

57
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Xue Zhao came to see you on the road.

58
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
He was attacked by bandits.

59
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,600
He died in a place where he couldn't be buried.

60
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Did you do it?

61
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Did you?

62
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Why did you do it?

63
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,600
I've let you down.

65
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Father.

66
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Zhao.

67
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Father.

68
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Zhao.

69
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Zhao.

70
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Zhao.

71
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Zhao.

72
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Zhao.

73
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Zhao.

74
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Zhao.

75
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Zhao.

76
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Zhao.

77
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Zhao.

78
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Zhao.

79
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Zhao.

80
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Zhao.

81
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Zhao.

82
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Zhao.

83
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Zhao.

84
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Zhao.

85
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Zhao.

86
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Zhao.

87
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Zhao.

88
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Zhao.

89
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Zhao.

90
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Zhao.

91
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Zhao.

92
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Zhao.

93
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Zhao.

94
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Zhao.

95
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Zhao.

96
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Zhao.

97
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Zhao.

98
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Zhao.

99
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Zhao.

100
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Zhao.

101
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
Don't move.

102
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
You're stepping on dirt.

103
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Come here.

104
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Tell me what you've been doing tonight.

105
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,600
I've taken care of Consort Xue.

106
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
How?

107
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I buried her alive.

108
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Buried alive?

109
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
I just want to make Consort Xue a concubine and I'll be your concubine.

110
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
So she can serve us for a long time.

111
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
If it weren't for us, how could you do such a thing?

112
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
You killed my mother and my sister.

113
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
You destroyed her reputation.

114
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
You forced me to do such a thing.

115
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
That's right.

116
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,600
I designed everything last night.

117
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,600
You're not clear about the whole thing.

118
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
I have to make plans for you.

119
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,600
If Consort Xue doesn't leave, our whole family will be on the stage tomorrow.

120
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
You choose.

121
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Are you trying to make her feel unfair?

122
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
No.

123
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Smile.

124
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Why aren't you smiling?

125
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
You're feeling sorry for your little sister?

126
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Stop talking.

127
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Shen Lang, Shen Lang.

128
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I don't like killing people.

129
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,600
As the eldest princess, I'm very generous and generous.

130
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,600
I have to give you this heartless and heartless man a year.

131
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Wan Ning.

132
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
What do you want me to do?

133
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
You're a murderer now.

134
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Only I can save you.

135
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Please help me.

136
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I beg you.

137
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Kneel down.

138
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Be good.

139
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Tell me.

140
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,600
What was your little lady like when she was buried in the soil?

141
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Was she yelling at you or begging for mercy?

142
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Or she loved you and was willing to die?

143
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Don't push me anymore.

144
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
We'll die together.

145
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Will you die?

146
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Will you?

147
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,600
You are indeed my favorite Shen Lang.

148
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
You have a lot of strength.

149
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
You're a rich and powerful woman.

150
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
You're a member of the family.

151
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Do you have any?

152
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Don't kneel down in my house.

153
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Go home.

154
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
My husband.

155
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,600
My husband.

156
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Go.

157
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Go.

158
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Why are you all standing there?

159
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Are you waiting for the reward?

160
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Duke Su.

161
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Manager Jia.

162
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
I'm in a good mood today.

163
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
I only ask once.

164
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Whose knife is your private business?

165
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,600
I'll reward you for killing Duke Su.

166
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Run.

167
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Run.

168
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Run.

169
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Duke Su.

170
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Duke Su.

171
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Please spare my life.

172
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Master.

173
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Give it to me.

174
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
I'll take it to the dungeon for a few days.

175
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
I'll tell him what you want to know.

176
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
So he won't get the master's ears.

177
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
I'll tell him.

178
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
I'll tell him everything.

179
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Please spare my life.

180
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
I...

181
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
You're so fast.

182
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Go after him.

183
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
It's the goods that Mr. Qin gave me.

184
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
How did you find Mr. Qin?

185
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
He's lost his way.

186
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Where is the next intersection?

187
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Jingzheng Mountain.

188
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Hangling Pass.

189
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
What time is it?

190
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
The time of the jade statue meeting.

191
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
What about the stolen money and private money?

192
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,940
The

193
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,600
jade statue meeting is over.

194
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
The jade statue meeting is over.

195
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
The jade statue meeting is over.

196
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
General Jia, you did well.

197
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Do you have any more questions to ask him?

198
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
He is useless.

199
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
I'll give him to you, my second brother.

200
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Go.

201
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Master, I didn't catch him.

202
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Since you want to kill him,

203
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
prove that there is a big fish behind this private case.

204
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Go back to the mansion first.

205
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Wait for Yue Zhong to go to the Spirit Temple.

206
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
There is the god of the emperor.

207
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,600
There is also Yue Zhong.

208
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
The soul-gathering spirit

209
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,600
is overflowing.

210
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Shen Zhuang Yan Lang is a really heartless man.

211
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
A few days ago, his wife

212
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:46,600
ran away with someone.

213
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
She met with a lot of trouble in Qingcheng Mountain.

214
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
She is even getting better.

215
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
She is the first talented woman

216
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
in Huai Xiang.

217
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,880
What a pity.

218
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,600
The dead are the greatest. Say a few words.

219
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,080
Chu Xuan, why are you laughing?

220
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,440
I'm laughing because you're stupid.

221
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,480
What do you mean?

222
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,960
People shouldn't take risks. You're stupid.

223
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,600
I'm not stupid. I'm smart.

224
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,560
The

225
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,600
My Lady, we have to hurry.

226
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,760
It's going to be sunset soon.

227
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
If we don't hurry back, we'll be in a big trouble again.

228
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Yes.

229
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
My Lady.

230
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Chu Xuan.

231
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
Who are you?

232
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
What are you doing?

233
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Go away.

234
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
You can't die.

235
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Sister, don't be afraid.

236
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
My name is Jiang Li.

237
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
She's my maid.

238
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
We're here to help you.

239
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
You fainted by the river.

240
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
Do you remember?

241
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Who sent you here?

242
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
What are you doing?

243
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
No.

244
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
You're really interesting.

245
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
I'm not.

246
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
No.

247
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
You're really interesting.

248
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,520
This is the daughter of the Prime Minister.

249
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
How could it hurt you?

250
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Sister, how's your injury?

251
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Drink some water.

252
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
Sister, don't be afraid.

253
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
We're not bad people.

254
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
Go.

255
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
Go away.

256
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
Go.

257
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Go.

258
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Go.

259
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Calm down first.

260
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
We'll go to the temple to find some wild fruits.

261
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Did you give up your father for her?

262
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
Father.

263
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Please help us.

264
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
I swear on my life.

265
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,280
As long as I live,

266
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,280
I won't let A Li suffer.

267
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
The government in the capital is so high.

268
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
If you swallow meat,

269
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
you can't get out of pain.

270
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,280
A Li has been living under the cold window for years.

271
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
I have a place to live.

272
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I'll be mature and protect A Li.

273
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Please rest assured.

274
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,040
Father, please help me.

275
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Sister, what are you doing?

276
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Let go.

277
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Sister.

278
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Let me go.

279
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Sister.

280
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Let me go.

281
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Sister.

282
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
No matter what happens,

283
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
living is the most important thing.

284
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Only by living can we start over.

285
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Start over?

286
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
I'm not worthy.

287
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
I'm just a blind and blind.

288
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
I'm a blind man.

289
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
I'm not worthy.

290
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,800
I'm just a fool who thinks I'm stupid.

291
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
I'm not afraid of living.

292
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Sister.

293
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
It's not your fault to be blind.

294
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
The person who made the mistake is the one who failed you.

295
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Why do you use their fault to punish yourself?

296
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
What do you know?

297
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Sister.

298
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,800
I've been failed by the one I trust.

299
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
I feel the same way as you.

300
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
What are those people afraid of?

301
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
They're afraid of you living.

302
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
They're afraid of you and me living in a clear and clear way.

303
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
I'm afraid of you living.

304
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Look at their end.

305
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Living is the best way to fight against those who want you dead.

306
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Sister.

307
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
We're leaving.

308
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,560
We'll find another chance tomorrow to bring you medicine and food.

309
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,320
Put on your headgear.

310
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
Wait.

311
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Sister.

312
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
We're leaving.

313
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
We'll find a chance tomorrow.

314
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
We'll be back tomorrow morning.

315
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
I'm leaving.

316
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
I'm leaving.

317
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
We'll be back tomorrow morning.

318
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
I'm leaving.

319
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
I'm leaving.

320
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
I'm leaving.

321
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
I'm leaving.

322
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
Wait.

323
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,120
Bossach.

324
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,280
It's such a good food dad.

325
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,480
You don't need to go to pick firewood.

326
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,040
Bossach asked us to light up half a month.

327
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,560
Later, the mountains will be more humid.

328
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,320
You can go later.

329
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
If you get caught, you'll get beaten up.

330
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
You can't take the risk.

331
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Okay, I won't go.

332
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Go back to sleep.

333
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
Okay.

334
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,320
Madam, you should rest early.

335
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
Go back to sleep.

336
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
You're going out for the first time.

337
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,320
Jiang Li, what are you going to do?

338
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,320
If you don't talk, you'll be punished.

339
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
Madam! Madam!

340
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Tong'er!

341
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Don't drag me!

342
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
If you want to drag me, hit me.

343
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
Drag me down!

344
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
Madam!

345
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,320
Tong'er!

346
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,320
Madam!

347
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,320
Madam!

348
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Tell me, are you going out to meet your lover?

349
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
No.

350
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,320
No.

351
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
You still dare to be stubborn?

352
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,320
Stop hitting me! Stop hitting me!

353
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
You hit me!

354
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Madam!

355
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Let me go! Madam, let me go!

356
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Jiang Li went out without permission.

357
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
Madam!

358
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
He was a thug.

359
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,320
He defamed the reputation of Zhenyu Hall.

360
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,320
You all go and hit me one by one!

361
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
You hit me!

362
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
Hit me!

363
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Please! Madam!

364
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
Madam!

365
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
Don't think about it.

366
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,320
Stop hitting me! Stop hitting me!

367
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
You hit me!

368
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
You hit me.

369
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Get lost!

370
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Madam!

371
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,320
Let me go! Madam!

372
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Hit me!

373
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,320
Stop hitting me!

374
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,320
I beg you!

375
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Stop hitting me!

376
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Madam!

377
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
I want you to be punished.

378
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
I want to wake you up.

379
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
Every step is a trap.

380
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,320
Everyone has to be punished.

381
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,320
Everyone has to hit me!

382
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,320
Hit me hard!

383
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,320
I can't hit you anymore!

384
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,320
Stop hitting me!

385
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,320
Madam!

386
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,320
Stop hitting me!

387
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,320
Stop hitting me!

388
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,320
Stop hitting me!

389
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,320
I want to wake you up!

390
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,320
Madam!

391
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
Sister.

392
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,320
It's not your fault that people are not close to each other.

393
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,320
The person who wronged you is the one who failed you.

394
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,320
Why do you have to punish yourself with their fault?

395
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
No matter what happens,

396
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
living is the most important thing.

397
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Living is the only chance to start over.

398
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,320
What are those people afraid of?

399
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,320
They are afraid that you will live.

400
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,320
They are afraid that you and I will live in a clear and clear way.

401
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,320
Look at the consequences of their actions.

402
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
I want to live.

403
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,320
I must live.

404
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Everyone went to pick fruits.

405
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Why didn't Madam Jiang go?

406
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
She was beaten up like that yesterday.

407
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,320
How could she get out of bed?

408
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
From now on, her fire

409
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
will probably be on us.

410
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,320
Whoever let her go out at night,

411
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
I don't know who she met.

412
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,320
She deserves to see a wild man.

413
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
Tong'er!

414
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
Tong'er!

415
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
Where is Jiang Lin?

416
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
If it wasn't for the food and drinks I sent you,

417
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
would Madam have become like this?

418
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
Get out!

419
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Jiang Lin.

420
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
Jiang Lin.

421
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
Jiang Lin.

422
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Sister.

423
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,320
Sister.

424
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
Sister.

425
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
Why are you here?

426
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,320
This place is not to be left.

427
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
Hurry and leave.

428
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
Jiang Lin.

429
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,320
You shouldn't have risked your life to send me things.

430
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,320
When I first came here,

431
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,320
I also searched for the shortcut.

432
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,320
If it wasn't for Tong'er,

433
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,320
I might have died long ago.

434
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,320
When I see you, it's like seeing myself.

435
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,320
People in despair

436
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,320
always hope to have someone to help them.

437
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,320
So I wanted to pull you by the side.

438
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,320
Isn't it just being beaten up?

439
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,320
I didn't love anyone before.

440
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,320
It's just that this time,

441
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,320
I really want to sleep.

442
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Jiang Lin.

443
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,320
Sister.

444
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,320
Am I going to die?

445
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Jiang Lin, hold on.

446
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
I'll get down from the mountain.

447
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,320
I'll go find the Jiang family and ask them to pick you up.

448
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
Sister.

449
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
I saved you before

450
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
because I was hoping

451
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
that you could help me.

452
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
You could help me deliver the letter to the Jiang family.

453
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,320
Tell my father

454
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,320
that I've suffered enough.

455
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,320
I was wrong.

456
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,320
I don't want to stay here anymore.

457
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,320
But now,

458
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
it seems

459
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
that it's too late.

460
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,320
Everything is too late. You can hold on.

461
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,320
Sister.

462
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,320
They all say that I'm a murderer.

463
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
I'm not.

464
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,320
I really am not.

465
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,320
Mother, I'll make you some chrysanthemum tea.

466
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,320
I took the chrysanthemum I planted that day

467
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
and gave it to Mother.

468
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,320
Mother said it was pretty.

469
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,320
So I wanted to take Mother to the Imperial College

470
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
and make her chrysanthemum tea.

471
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,320
Mother, where are you going?

472
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
A'Ran.

473
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Hurry!

474
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
There's someone here!

475
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,320
Help her up!

476
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
It's you!

477
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
Are you okay?

478
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,320
Madam!

479
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
Hurry! Help her up!

480
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Let me see!

481
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,320
Let me see!

482
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
Madam!

483
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,320
Blood!

484
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Blood!

485
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
Madam, are you okay?

486
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
I'm fine.

487
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Jiang Min, I'm not good enough for you.

488
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,320
Why did you do this to me?

489
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Jinmu was too gentle to me.

490
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
He was a virtuous man.

491
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,320
I was surprised to see him being taught by him.

492
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,320
But I still can't believe

493
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
that day,

494
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
he said something

495
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,320
and put the evil spirit of killing my mother

496
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,320
on my head.

497
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,320
After that,

498
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,320
I was locked in Zhengyu for ten years.

499
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,320
Ten whole years.

500
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,320
No matter how I defend myself,

501
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,320
no one cares about me.

502
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
No one trusts me.

503
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
I believe you.

504
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,320
I believe you're not that kind of person.

505
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
Jinmu,

506
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,320
I told you everything I know.

507
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,320
I just want you to do me a favor.

508
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,320
Don't mention it.

509
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,320
You made me a mess.

510
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,320
I'll win no matter what.

511
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,320
For ten years,

512
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,320
I've never left Zhengyu.

513
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,320
The Jiang family never asked me,

514
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,320
or looked at me.

515
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,320
Maybe in their heart,

516
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,320
I've died long ago.

517
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,320
Except for the real person,

518
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,320
no one knows what I look like now.

519
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,320
This hairpin

520
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,320
was given to me by my mother.

521
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,320
It proves my identity.

522
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Jin,

523
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,320
I beg you.

524
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,320
I beg you to take it

525
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,320
and go to my father.

526
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Tell him

527
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,320
I've suffered a lot here.

528
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,320
I'm so miserable.

529
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,320
But I'm not wrong.

530
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,320
I've never been wrong.

531
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
I hate him.

532
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,320
I hate every one of the Jiang family.

533
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,320
Even if I'm in the hell,

534
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,320
I'll curse them

535
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,320
for not letting go.

536
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,320
Jiang Lin,

537
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,320
you said it.

538
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,320
Only by living can you take revenge.

539
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,320
You must live well.

540
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,320
Jiang Lin, what are you doing?

541
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,320
I've planted this pear tree

542
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,320
when I first came here.

543
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,320
I've never bloomed flowers in more than ten years.

544
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,320
The flowers withered

545
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,320
and the spring white is no longer here.

546
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,320
Where does he want to go?

547
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
Mother.

548
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Li.

549
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Mother.

550
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,320
Are you here to pick me up?

551
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,320
I miss you so much.

552
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,320
I miss you so much.

553
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,320
So beautiful.

554
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
Mother.

555
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,320
Mother.

556
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,320
Mother.

557
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,320
Mother, wake up.

558
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Wake up.

559
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,320
Who wants to live

560
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,320
in the world

561
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,320
and live in the world?

562
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,320
I'm here to pick you up.

563
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,320
I'm here to pick you up.

564
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
Mother.

565
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,320
Mother, wake up.

566
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,320
God is really funny.

567
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,320
The innocent

568
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,320
is in a lonely place.

569
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,320
The guilty

570
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:30,320
is living a carefree life.

571
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,320
The guilty

572
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,320
is living a carefree life.

573
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
Master.

574
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Jiang Lin can't stop working, can he?

575
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,320
He's not even up yet.

576
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,320
He's only pretending.

577
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,320
I'm going to fight them.

578
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,320
Let them fight for my wife.

579
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,320
What are you doing?

580
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,320
Do you want to avenge your wife?

581
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,320
Then listen to me.

582
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,320
The law is unfair.

583
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,320
I'll take care of our justice.

584
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,320
You're lying here all day.

585
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
Stop pretending.

586
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Get up.

587
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,320
Jiang Lin.

588
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,320
Jiang Lin.

589
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Who are you?

590
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,320
I'm your benefactor.

591
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
Nonsense.

592
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
What's your relationship with Jiang Lin?

593
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
The one you should be concerned about

594
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,320
is the one lying down, right?

595
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,320
You killed the daughter of the official.

596
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
I'm going to report it to the government.

597
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,320
Did you forget that Jiang Lin was beaten to death by you?

598
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,320
The government also needs witness.

599
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,320
All of us here can testify.

600
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,320
You broke into the Zhen Nv Hall without permission

601
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,320
and killed her.

602
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,320
She's the only one who can't stand

603
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,320
all the witnesses.

604
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
Come here.

605
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
Look at yourself.

606
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,320
Look.

607
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,320
The dead man won't lie.

608
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,320
He's hurt.

609
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,320
He's been injured for years.

610
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,320
How can you get rid of the Zhen Nv Hall

611
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:21,200
when the

612
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,320
Zhen Nv Hall is Jiang Lin?

613
00:45:53,320 --> 00:46:00,320
If there's no memory of happiness

614
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:08,320
How can it go through the sad bottom?

615
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Two cold words

616
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,320
The heartless body

617
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,320
Two cold words

618
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,320
The heartless body

619
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,320
Holding hands

620
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,320
Can it go through the blood?

621
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,320
In the cold wind

622
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:40,320
In the long night

623
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:48,320
Embracing the remaining warmth

624
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,320
Holding on

625
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,320
Uncertainty

626
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:03,320
Can it bury the regret of yesterday?

627
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:10,320
Love is to cherish with life

628
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:18,320
Even if everything is hurt

629
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,320
No matter sorrow or joy

630
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,320
I believe you

631
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:33,320
I'd rather be trapped in the coldness of the world

632
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,320
Live on

633
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,320
Spend all your courage

634
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,320
Love on

635
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:48,320
Until you breathe

636
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,320
Pass through the loneliness of half life

637
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,320
Only to meet you

638
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:19,300
After the
