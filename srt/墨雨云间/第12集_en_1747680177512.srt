1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I will never give up.

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Then I will not give up.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Slowly, I will endure the pain of life.

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
After going through the cold winter, I still feel the same.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Waiting for the spring to return in the clouds.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will not give up.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Waiting for the spring to return in the clouds.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The Long Ballad

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Put it here. You, put it there.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That high one, yes.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lightly, lightly. That flower is precious.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You, you, you come here. Put it here.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Dad, I won.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I didn't expect that you would be so good at

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
passing Li Er's advice.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What do you mean by passing her advice?

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's me who is talented.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You are right.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's clearly your talent.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Uncle, aunt.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Li Er.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You gave me so many flowers.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes, the flowers are blooming so beautifully.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's the most suitable for you.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Li Er.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Uncle.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Come, drink some tea.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I like this the most.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You only know how to eat.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This...

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Li Er.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You brought my Rui Er up.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I am very relieved.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I never thought that

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
someone who is not so good at it would be able to enter the palace to receive gifts.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
My good niece.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I really don't know how to thank you.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes, Li Er.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This matter is really thanks to you.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We are all family.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How can I be so grateful for your words?

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You three.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Do you have to be so hypocritical?

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
General.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What are you doing?

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will beat you to death.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Madam.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What's wrong, mother?

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's wrong with you?

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I am alive.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Your old medicine.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Madam, come here.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I will give it to you.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't move.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Madam.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Tong Er.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Come.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Come.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hurry.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let me see where it is.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Wait.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What's wrong?

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I heard that

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Zhou Yan Bang is going to ask you to change the engagement.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Zhou Yan Bang

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
has been spoiled since he was a child.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He does things without thinking about them.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He doesn't need to be a bad person.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Ning Yue Hou has locked him up.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
These days, their family

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
is doing things everywhere.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
They are going to put this matter down.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Really?

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
it's also a karma.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's not like when you just went to Zhen Nv Hall

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Aunt was in a hurry

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
to let Jiang Ruo Yao replace you.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It hurts.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The sun is shining.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's clear.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You are strong.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How can you be so modest?

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Brother.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why are you here?

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I want to ask you.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
In the daytime,

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
you are here

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
playing the piano.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What are you talking about?

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Brother.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I am a demon.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want Yuan Ping to help me heal.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You are a demon.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You are...

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Brother.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Brother.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What's wrong?

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So, I am

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
too old.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Brother.

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Help me to rub it.

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Get up.

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Brother.

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let me help you.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,780
Qing Rui won the title in the

107
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,000
age of age.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We are here to thank him.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He?

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You want to strangle me?

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Be gentle.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Go back and rub your old demon.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Madam.

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I will take you home

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
to rub your old demon.

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Rui Er.

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Coming.

118
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I want to go home.

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Madam.

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Be careful.

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Be careful.

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Come.

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Be careful.

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Qing Rui, let's lift her up.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hurry up.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We can't make it.

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Be careful.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Father.

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Be careful.

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have been busy with work these days.

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I am so glad

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
to know that you won the title in the age of age.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I am so glad to celebrate your birthday.

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I am so sorry

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
for your study in Mingyi Hall.

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't blame yourself.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I have been used to it for ten years.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I shouldn't have disturbed you

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
when you want to live in Mingyi Hall.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I was worried about the difficulty

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
of Mingyi Hall's study.

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You can't handle it.

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I was afraid that you would have more troubles.

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It would increase your troubles.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I didn't expect that

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
you can write well.

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You are also good at playing the zither.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I am so happy.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
There is a sister in the Hall of Truth.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
She is a zither player.

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I just learned some from her.

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Before she left,

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
she left the zither and the score to me.

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
She asked me to practice more.

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I was too lazy to practice the zither.

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I was scolded by my father

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
for being late in cleaning the zither.

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Li, you have suffered a lot.

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There is no need to hide between us.

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I am willing to take the responsibility.

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If you have any questions,

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
just tell me.

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I know that

164
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you had a engagement with Zhou Yanbang.

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But then you changed to Ruoyao.

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I have never asked you about it.

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I am sorry.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I didn't know that you were so good at playing the zither.

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I was too lazy to practice the zither.

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I was too lazy to practice the zither.

171
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I was too lazy to practice the zither.

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Please don't be so angry.

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Your father is very wanton.

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He won't bedogs about it.

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So we shouldn't leave it under his control.

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You are quite unfortunate.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Mom.

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Don't you know I am suffering from my son.

179
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Mom!

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You are really unhappy.

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Dad, don't 하고ere too much.

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Whatuna nina.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Li has never liked Zhou Yanbang.

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
In the past,

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
we have never had this kind of relationship.

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,840
You don't believe me?

187
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Not at all.

188
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,000
Fine.

189
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,240
I won't mention it.

190
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,880
I'll hold a celebration party for you the next day.

191
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,160
You've made a name for the Jiang family.

192
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,320
You deserve the reward.

193
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,560
Thank you, father.

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,560
Okay.

195
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,640
I'll leave now.

196
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,280
Sister.

197
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,560
Look.

198
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,000
Only I can rely on myself.

199
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,000
If I didn't make a name for myself

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,600
in this life,

201
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,920
it would be my fault

202
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,800
if I didn't make it.

203
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,720
You've got the crown.

204
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,680
You've got the gift from His Majesty.

205
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,280
You've made a name for yourself in Yan.

206
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,520
It'll be much easier in the future.

207
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,040
My wife is blessed by God.

208
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,920
She'll be happy.

209
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,680
I'm afraid I'm not ready to be a wife.

210
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,520
It's not the time to be at ease.

211
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,400
I'm afraid the real danger

212
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,520
is ahead.

213
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Idiot.

214
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,560
Father.

215
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,080
I was just saying it

216
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,440
as a monk.

217
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,840
They didn't take it seriously.

218
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,120
Why did you take it seriously?

219
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,800
Besides,

220
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,280
I'm a monk now.

221
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,640
I'm not ashamed of the Li family.

222
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,440
You're ashamed?

223
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
You're the one who believes in the Li family now.

224
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,240
I've been in the court for so many years.

225
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,400
I've been relying on Yan Chu Bi Xing.

226
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
You've been working hard that day.

227
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,160
Today, you'll be my slave.

228
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,040
But, father.

229
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
How can you really see me as a monk?

230
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,080
Why not?

231
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,840
I've been trapped in Zhenyu Hall for ten years.

232
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,720
I've been rewarded with a lot of rewards.

233
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,120
Look at yourself.

234
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,000
I've been asking for your advice for more than ten years.

235
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,400
But I've failed.

236
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,840
Yes, father.

237
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,760
I know my mistake.

238
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,520
I'll definitely learn more from you.

239
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,080
I'll never fall behind.

240
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,920
It's too late.

241
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,080
Now, everyone in the capital knows about your bet.

242
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,680
I can't protect you anymore.

243
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,360
Stay in the temple for me.

244
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
If you perform well and win the title,

245
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
I might have a chance to take you out.

246
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,920
I'll also correct your bad habits.

247
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,640
Take him away.

248
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,320
Father.

249
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,440
Wait.

250
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,000
Father.

251
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,240
Brother.

252
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,280
Please help me.

253
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,680
Brother.

254
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,920
Please help me.

255
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,080
Brother.

256
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,320
Father.

257
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,880
I don't want to be a monk.

258
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,920
I haven't been to the cave.

259
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,840
I haven't been able to wear the bandage for you.

260
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,000
You can't make me a monk.

261
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,400
Why are you laughing?

262
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,240
It's just a pity that my brother

263
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,560
can't realize your hard work.

264
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,320
I did it for you.

265
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,680
For your career

266
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,240
and the career of Lord Cheng,

267
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,640
our family has lost a young master.

268
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,400
If you succeed in your career,

269
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,760
our family will be rich and rich.

270
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,440
This is the fortune I have already zehn years ago.

271
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,360
You must also should keep it to yourself.

272
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,520
Please listen to me.

273
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,440
I need you so badly.

274
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Brother.

275
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,720
My과izen,

276
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,120
the stone burning flame

277
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
will give us a new hope in the falling hell.

278
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,240
When will you be able to set out for hell?

279
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,520
If we take the lead and go into Luyang directly,

280
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,960
and get the heart of the manor,

281
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,760
the Ye family will soon be the burden on our father's shoulders.

282
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,880
Don't make any more mistakes.

283
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,120
Why can't you even deal with a little girl?

284
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,000
I was thinking that Brother Li could deal with her.

285
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,680
I didn't expect that even Zhou Yanbang was fascinated by her.

286
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,200
If even the heart of Jiang Yuanbai is broken by her,

287
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,440
then everything will be too late.

288
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,800
A wild girl who has been in Mount Qingcheng for ten years,

289
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,840
once she returned to the Jiang family, she played you around.

290
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,000
Now she just left the Jiang family,

291
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
and has become a nobleman,

292
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,720
and has almost turned over the Ming Yitang.

293
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,520
As a stepmother who raised her since childhood,

294
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,720
don't you think this is strange?

295
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,280
I know what you want to say is that

296
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,880
she is not Jiang Li at all.

297
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,960
I haven't been that stupid yet.

298
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,440
For this reason,

299
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,840
I especially investigated the person who wanted to kill Jiang Li the most.

300
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,440
You are the owner of the Zhengyutang in Mount Qingcheng.

301
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Do you want to leave the prison?

302
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
You are...

303
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,440
I was sent by the wife of the chancellor.

304
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,680
What do you want from me?

305
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,040
I have a question for you.

306
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,600
As long as you give me a satisfactory answer,

307
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
my wife will naturally get you out.

308
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,120
What question?

309
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Look at who this person is.

310
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,600
Isn't this your second wife?

311
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,400
Look more carefully.

312
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,120
She has lived with me for ten years.

313
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,240
Even if I am a scum,

314
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
I know her.

315
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,680
At that time, Lu Yuanfeng

316
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,800
broke the dirty deeds of Zhengyutang in front of the emperor.

317
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,680
The person who testified for her was Jiang Li.

318
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
The hall owner hated her to death.

319
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,480
If her identity was fake,

320
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
she would definitely not help her hide it.

321
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,360
From this, we can know that she is Jiang Li.

322
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,960
It's just that she is very scheming.

323
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,600
She hid it well under the eyes of everyone.

324
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,520
Then,

325
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,080
you can't keep her anymore.

326
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,680
What else can I do?

327
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,080
Do you still remember the matter of the Shen family?

328
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,080
You mean...

329
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,480
the Xue family?

330
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,880
The Xue family was caught in the room and ran to the mountain.

331
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,080
In the end, they still died.

332
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,680
The most feared thing for everyone to return to the show is the poem.

333
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,680
In a few days,

334
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,480
aren't they going to enter the palace to meet the emperor?

335
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,080
If something bad happens in the palace,

336
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,080
in front of the emperor,

337
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,480
even if Prime Minister Jiang wants to cover it up, it's still hard.

338
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,080
Now that Prime Minister Jiang likes her,

339
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,480
you don't have to be angry.

340
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,880
I will tell you her name first.

341
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,880
In the future, you will naturally be in trouble.

342
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,480
This is the palace.

343
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,680
If something bad happens, I'm afraid it will be hard to clean up.

344
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,880
Who do you think I am?

345
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,280
I won't harm your Prime Minister Jiang.

346
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,080
With me in the palace,

347
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,480
you can rest assured.

348
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,280
The Palace of the Great Wei

349
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,680
Greetings, Grandmother.

350
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,880
This time, His Majesty personally held the banquet.

351
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,080
Our Jiang family won the title of leader.

352
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
Of course, we must dress more politely.

353
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,880
Especially you, Second Young Lady.

354
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
This is the first time we are entering the palace.

355
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,680
We must be more serious about this.

356
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,280
I especially looked for some famous shops in the capital.

357
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,880
I asked you to choose.

358
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Grandmother, this time, I entered the palace

359
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,280
to receive the reward in the name of the Jiang family.

360
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,080
I'm willing to follow your decision on what to wear.

361
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,280
You child, you are pushing the responsibility to me.

362
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,480
Fine. I will help you arrange it.

363
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
There is only oneospin.

364
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,680
Do you remember this sentence?

365
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,480
You have no courage.

366
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,280
The silk clothes are quite delicious for today.

367
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,280
The quality light seems beautiful with this clear belt.

368
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,480
Thank you, Grandmother.

369
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,280
Mother-in-law Zhang, send them off.

370
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Yes.

371
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,280
Although you grew up in Zhenyu Hall,

372
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,280
you still look so beautiful

373
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
with your mother.

374
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
You look like a family member.

375
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Thank you for your praise, Grandmother.

376
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Everyone is praising you.

377
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Our family members are still unable to praise you.

378
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,280
I'm so happy to see you today.

379
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,280
We've been separated for ten years.

380
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,280
I didn't expect you to have such a good temper and memory.

381
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,280
I don't dare to let you down, Father.

382
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
And Grandmother.

383
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Good.

384
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,280
You are indeed a good child of the Jiang family.

385
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I have to tell you a few more things.

386
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Since you are the child of the Jiang family,

387
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
you must be with the Jiang family.

388
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
The Jiang family is a family of honor.

389
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,280
It's a loss for everyone.

390
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
You don't have to be a family member.

391
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
You must be careful.

392
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Take care of yourself and your sister.

393
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,280
There are many people who are crazy and evil.

394
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
If something happens,

395
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
don't feel wronged.

396
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
Come back and tell me.

397
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Yes.

398
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
I understand.

399
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
What are you doing?

400
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Mother, I'm not going to the court.

401
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
His Majesty is giving a banquet.

402
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
You can't just say you're not going.

403
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
His Majesty wants to see the leader.

404
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm just a sidekick.

405
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
It doesn't matter if I go or not.

406
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
What does it matter?

407
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Ruoyang,

408
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,280
you just lost this year's fortune.

409
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Why do you do this?

410
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,280
I've been practicing chess every day for so many years.

411
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
I haven't lost a single game.

412
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
But what's the use of this?

413
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,280
In the end,

414
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
I was beaten by the wild girl from the mountains.

415
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Otherwise, I wouldn't be this piece of material.

416
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Otherwise,

417
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,280
it's a mistake that my mother asked me to learn this.

418
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
What are you afraid of losing once?

419
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
It seems that I spoil you too much.

420
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
That's why you can't stand failure.

421
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,280
You have to go to this banquet.

422
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,280
You've already lost me once.

423
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,280
If you dare to lose me again,

424
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
I'll pretend I've never had a daughter like you.

425
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Watch her change.

426
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,280
Yes.

427
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Sister,

428
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
Sui's Dokui is the winner in the palace.

429
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,280
Every step is in your expectation.

430
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Sister said before

431
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,280
that she would attack the person behind Shen Yurong.

432
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
What should I do?

433
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Of course, you should pass Shen Yurong.

434
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,280
Although I don't know the other person's background,

435
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
I can confirm one thing.

436
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,280
It's that the other person values Shen Yurong very much.

437
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,280
I'm going to use this to force her to show herself.

438
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,280
But you don't even know if the other person is a man or a woman.

439
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
How can you force her to show herself?

440
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
She's a woman.

441
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Woman?

442
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,280
When Shen Yurong killed me,

443
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
he said he had no choice.

444
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
I was just a little girl.

445
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
My father had no enemies.

446
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
The person who used Shen Yurong to kill me

447
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,280
was probably the position of the first lady.

448
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,280
This person is from a noble family.

449
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
He likes Shen Yurong.

450
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,280
He thinks I'm a mule.

451
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,280
No matter what, he's not simple.

452
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
You must be careful.

453
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Don't worry.

454
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
I will be careful.

455
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Shen Yurong

456
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Cousin?

457
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,940
and Pinggui

458
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,540
When he saw Wantong

459
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,460
just

460
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:42,760
He had been sleeping

461
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:44,880
baby

462
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:45,860
Bye

463
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,060
player

464
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,460
Stop

465
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,400
younger brother

466
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,880
What do you want?

467
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:57,900
company

468
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,880
Remember to unit

469
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,060
date

470
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,060
You're so nice.

471
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
Jiang Li is here.

472
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,060
Let's go together.

473
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,060
Father has prepared a carriage for us.

474
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,060
Ye Biao's carriage is ready.

475
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,060
We can go to the rescue team.

476
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,060
Let's go.

477
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,060
Jiu Jin Rui.

478
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,060
It's okay. Let's go.

479
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Ye Biao's carriage is ready.

480
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,060
Ye Shijie.

481
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,060
What's wrong?

482
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
Why are you staring at Jiang Li like this?

483
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
I know.

484
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,060
You must have an interest in her.

485
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,060
This fabric is like soft smoke.

486
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,060
I don't have any.

487
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,020
You don't have anything.

488
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,780
Look at you.

489
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,860
Look at your black face.

490
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,300
You're almost as red as a red face.

491
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,860
You must want to use this

492
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,060
fabric that's soft like fish and soft like smoke

493
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,260
to make yourself

494
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,980
a fabric that's soft like fish and soft like smoke.

495
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,020
I'm not.

496
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,820
I'm just a little nervous.

497
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,660
Alright.

498
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,860
I know.

499
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,660
It's my first time

500
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,740
to attack.

501
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,020
I'm nervous.

502
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,860
I thought I was the only one

503
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,060
who was so nervous that I couldn't sleep.

504
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,740
We're here.

505
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:07,620
The honey flowers are scattered all over the ground.

506
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,780
The wind blows every sigh.

507
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,340
Ha Li, I'm going.

508
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,940
Don't worry.

509
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,220
I'll wait for you outside the palace.

510
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,060
Actually, you can enter the palace with me.

511
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,340
You're the top of the class.

512
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,900
Entering the palace is a reward.

513
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,460
Why should I go in with you?

514
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,380
I'm so tired today.

515
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,620
I'm going to send you out.

516
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,500
Mother is already very unhappy.

517
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,220
You're the top of the class.

518
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,420
If you don't follow me,

519
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,140
who else can follow me?

520
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,220
I know.

521
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,820
It's just that I don't understand the rules in the palace.

522
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,460
If there's anything wrong with my manners,

523
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,820
it's not like I'm harming you.

524
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,820
Ha Li.

525
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,020
I'm sorry.

526
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,020
I'm sorry.

527
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,020
I'm sorry.

528
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,020
I'm sorry.

529
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,220
Ha Li.

530
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,420
You and I are a couple.

531
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,820
We're a couple.

532
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,820
I know.

533
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,020
It's getting late.

534
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,620
You should go back early.

535
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,420
I'll wait for you here.

536
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,820
My top man.

537
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:17,420
Or is it love that's trapped you?

538
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,620
Ah Li.

539
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,820
You're here.

540
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,220
You 옆.

541
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,620
Right.

542
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,820
You come together, don't you?

543
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,740
I and Jiang Jingrui

544
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,420
are the makestas.

545
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,420
We're friends.

546
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,820
Like you always come here,

547
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,420
let's meet each other again.

548
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,420
Okay.

549
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,420
You two have a date?

550
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,420
Jiang Jin Rui and I have a date

551
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,420
and my cousin burned us up

552
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
I see

553
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,660
But

554
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,660
Sister Ye was not trying to mislead you

555
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,180
How did she burn you?

556
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,180
You know a lot about Ye's cousin

557
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,100
Why don't I ask Jiang Jin Rui to take you

558
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
to find Ye's cousin next time?

559
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,100
What are you talking about?

560
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Let's go in

561
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,640
For so long, he just wasn't able to find out anything about your past affairs

562
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Everyone

563
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,000
Address

564
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
I'm so worried

565
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,440
Use the storage room

566
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,660
Just a second

567
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,300
3rd Sister, let's attend the wedding first.

568
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,940
We should make Master Zhou unhappy later.

569
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,540
So what if he is unhappy?

570
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,100
What are you?

571
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,500
Do you think I have a chance to talk with him?

572
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,300
Yuan'er.

573
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,780
Are you okay?

574
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,140
Why haven't you been feeling tipsy lately?

575
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,700
It's nothing.

576
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,700
What are you looking at?

577
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,940
That's Jiang Lin and Liu Xu's seats.

578
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,940
What are you looking at?

579
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,100
That's Jiang Lin and Liu Xu's position

580
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,380
They haven't come yet

581
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,700
They must have a bad luck

582
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,780
and are here to play tricks

583
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,620
They must be

584
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,060
It's good that he didn't come

585
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,380
What did you say?

586
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,100
Nothing

587
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,940
The Imperial Court

588
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,980
His Majesty is here

589
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,540
Consort Li is here

590
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,740
It's my first time to see Consort Li

591
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,860
She looks much younger than my mother

592
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,100
Isn't she?

593
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,060
She was the consort of the late emperor

594
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,500
Or you think His Majesty

595
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,780
will ignore the loyalty

596
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,180
and make her consort?

597
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,500
Be quiet

598
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,260
Don't shout

599
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,260
Greetings, Your Majesty

600
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,980
Consort Li

601
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,820
Arise

602
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,580
Thank you, Your Majesty

603
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,700
Since ancient times, students have been friends for 600 million years

604
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,900
You are all the most important ones

605
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,580
Today, His Majesty is here

606
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,740
First, to ask you to read

607
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,460
Second, to reward the head of the Sui family

608
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,460
The head of the Sui family greets Your Majesty

609
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,300
You are Ye Shijie?

610
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,740
Your Majesty, it's me

611
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,060
Good

612
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,260
The Luyang Ye family also has

613
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,740
a talented talent like you

614
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,740
It shows that you are well-educated

615
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,820
and focused on your work

616
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,740
Your Majesty, you are too kind

617
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,420
I'm not worthy of it

618
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,020
I work day and night

619
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,740
I'm doing this for the sake of the country

620
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,300
I don't owe Your Majesty

621
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,220
You are doing this for the sake of the country

622
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,100
The Ministry of Revenue and Security is doing a great job

623
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,900
Recently, the justice has been transferred

624
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,740
I'm also here to make a wish

625
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,540
I'll appoint you as the deputy of the Ministry of Revenue

626
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,860
and the minister of the Ministry of Revenue tomorrow

627
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,900
to be the deputy of the Ministry of Revenue

628
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,060
I accept the decree

629
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,700
Thank you, Your Majesty

630
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,940
I heard that there is a second wife of the Jiang family

631
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,140
She has been alone in the Zhennv Hall for ten years

632
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,420
but she is strong and unyielding

633
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,260
In this Sui family, she has won the title

634
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,500
and has made a name for herself

635
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,660
That person is you, right?

636
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,020
I'm Jiang Li

637
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,020
Greetings, Your Majesty

638
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,180
You are talented and exquisite

639
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,380
I heard that you have been in the Zhennv Hall for ten years

640
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,980
I'm very curious about how you did it

641
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,980
Although the Zhennv Hall is in the mountains

642
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,380
I am suspicious of it

643
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,420
There are many masters in the mountains

644
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,300
But the common people

645
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,060
are known for their love and sorrow

646
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,740
So I can't see it

647
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,700
I happen to be young and divorced

648
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,940
I'm cold and lonely

649
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,580
But I have no other things

650
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,620
I'm simple

651
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,340
So I just got into the eyes of a master

652
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,900
and learned some tricks

653
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,020
You are in such a desolate place

654
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,380
You are not calm

655
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,540
Instead, you are busy with your work day and night

656
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,620
It's rare

657
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,500
Guards, give me the treasure

658
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,420
You are all talented

659
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,100
I should reward you

660
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,380
I will give you these treasures

661
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,100
Your Majesty

662
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,340
Your Majesty, the treasures are rare

663
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,220
But I don't have them here

664
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,900
Please exchange them

665
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,100
It's the first time someone

666
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,420
refuses my rewards

667
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,780
I dare not refuse

668
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,020
But I don't know how to taste

669
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,420
Your Majesty gave me the jade and jade

670
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,500
It's inevitable

671
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,700
So I dare to say it

672
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,100
What do you want?

673
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,860
I'm obsessed with learning

674
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,860
I read a novel of Shen Xue

675
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,700
It's a good book

676
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,580
It's also popular among scholars

677
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,100
I'm not talented

678
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,300
I admire Shen Xue's literary talent

679
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,980
But I dare not to ask for advice

680
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,460
Today, I ask for your permission

681
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,580
to let Shen Xue guide me in learning

682
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,300
I'm very happy

683
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,740
I will be more considerate in the future

684
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,700
Go

685
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,820
How daft

686
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,460
Miss Jiang looks so stiff

687
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,260
Does she like Shen Xue?

688
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,500
She is the perfect match

689
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,620
Nonsense

690
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,540
What's wrong?

691
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,260
I didn't come.

692
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,740
I only knew it after I asked.

693
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,580
That master had a low family background.

694
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,180
His only son was a soldier.

695
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:03,940
So,

696
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,420
although he was old,

697
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,980
he had to serve Yao Yi.

698
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,940
He was exhausted in the end.

699
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,460
Such a miserable life.

700
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,820
What a life.

701
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,940
Thank you, Madam.

702
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,900
What's wrong?

703
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,700
In the test,

704
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,140
there's only one question about Yao Yi.

705
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,900
I don't know how to write it.

706
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,020
Thank you for giving me the answer.

707
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,820
No wonder you said you were simple-minded.

708
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,860
Ordinary people can't say that.

709
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,420
Although men and women are different,

710
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,020
if you are determined to study,

711
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,020
you will be fine.

712
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,460
The theory of Yao Yi is really good.

713
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,100
It's not that the people can't be honest.

714
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,140
I also read this article.

715
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,300
I know the talent of Shen Qing and the Jin family.

716
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,860
As a woman,

717
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,340
it's rare for you to be so good at studying.

718
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,300
I agree.

719
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,340
Shen Qing.

720
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,940
Professor Shen,

721
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,420
His Majesty is calling you.

722
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,300
Yes.

723
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,180
I order you to give a serious advice to Madam Jiang.

724
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,500
Don't be careless.

725
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,620
Yes.

726
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,900
I have a question

727
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,740
for Madam Jiang.

728
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,500
Professor Shen, please.

729
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
The theory of Yao Yi

730
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,260
is my old work when I was a prince.

731
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,940
It's been a long time.

732
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,860
I have hope.

733
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,620
I don't know why Madam Jiang

734
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,460
is so fond of this theory.

735
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,340
Maybe you can write this theory.

736
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,140
The official seal of the Ministry of War

737
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,940
is white and white.

738
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,900
It's worried about Chun Ning.

739
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,460
White and white.

740
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,300
It's worried about Chun Ning.

741
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,940
I

742
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,020
will give a speech with Madam Jiang.

743
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,700
Your Highness.

744
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,380
Please stand up.

745
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,900
Realize that

746
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,500
I just like Princess Ting�

747
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,260
Princess Ting,

748
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,500
is my wife.

749
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,180
HAO ZHAO.

750
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,860
不,

751
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,060
you are way out!

752
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,780
I know she likes you.

753
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,580
How could you?

754
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,620
however,

755
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,380
Who would let you down?

756
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,940
I do.

757
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
Your Majesty!

758
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,540
Your Majesty!

759
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,420
Mr. Shi.

760
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,460
Mr. Shi.

761
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:20,860
Please.

762
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,900
Please.

763
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,180
Mr. Shen.

764
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,780
I was rude to you.

765
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,780
You were still serving the Princess.

766
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,020
And you asked for my permission.

767
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,260
Please forgive me.

768
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,740
It's okay.

769
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,940
You've given me two very good words.

770
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,780
I'm sorry.

771
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,140
Your words are not very sharp.

772
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,100
It seems that you're trying to change the situation.

773
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,980
My wife is dead.

774
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,140
I've changed my mind

775
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,380
for the rest of my life.

776
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,180
You miss your wife.

777
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,780
I used to be in love with her.

778
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,220
Now we're in love.

779
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,420
I don't know

780
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,580
how I can stop feeling sad.

781
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,380
Here comes the Princess.

782
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,500
Your Majesty!

783
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,460
Your Highness!

784
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,940
It's not good to tell the story of the Princess.

785
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,140
We should be careful.

786
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,260
Hurry.

787
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,500
Counselor Shen.

788
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,380
Greetings to Your Grace.

789
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,500
Were you drinking overall with coke with your motivations?

790
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Your Highness, it's a student from Sui clan who is drinking in Xiangchen.

791
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,500
A student?

792
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
I heard that on my way here,

793
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,500
there was a lady who wanted to be a teacher of Shen Xu clan.

794
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,500
I wonder which lady is so good-looking.

795
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,500
This is...

796
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
Could it be her?

797
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Your Highness,

798
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,500
I'm the daughter of Prime Minister Jiang, Jiang Li.

799
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
So you are Jiang Li.

800
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
You look so...

801
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
surprised.

802
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Play the music.

803
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Teacher Shen,

804
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
could you teach me

805
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,500
what is the song of the zither,

806
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,500
and what is the song of the flower and the water?

807
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Your Highness, please show me some respect.

808
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
You know that

809
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
I like to play the music

810
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,500
because of your dignity.

811
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Are you waiting for me here?

812
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
I feel that

813
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,500
Lady Jiang and the wife of Teacher Shen

814
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,500
look like sisters.

815
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
I've never seen Lady Shen.

816
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
I don't know why Your Highness said that.

817
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
But it's a coincidence.

818
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,500
My sisters are all here today.

819
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Teacher Shen loves his wife like honey.

820
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,500
What do you think?

821
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Do you think she looks like me?

822
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
There are many people who look alike in the world.

823
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,500
I dare not offend you.

824
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
I've heard that

825
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
this time,

826
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,500
there is a strange woman who dared not make a bet with Li's son.

827
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Today,

828
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,500
it's really extraordinary.

829
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,500
It's good that you've drunk the wine.

830
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Let's have a drink.

831
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,500
I'll also check it for His Majesty.

832
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:48,500
See if your hand is real or fake.

833
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
I've heard that

834
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:06,500
Lady Jiang is not only good at playing the zither,

835
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,500
but also archery.

836
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,500
Can you show us?

837
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,500
You've misunderstood.

838
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
I'm not good at archery.

839
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:22,500
Then I'll have to find you a good target.

840
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,500
What's the meaning of dead things?

841
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,500
It's enough for the former.

842
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,500
Let's pick a living one.

843
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Who to choose?

844
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Your Highness, please help Lady Jiang.

845
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Shen Yu Rong, you're really something.

846
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,500
In addition to me,

847
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,500
all the students in the school are still young.

848
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,500
If there's anything that can make you upset,

849
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,500
I hope you can forgive me.

850
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,500
That's good.

851
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,500
But when Shen Xue first appeared,

852
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:55,500
the sword of the Mei clan was so boring.

853
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,500
Come on, change the sword of Dai clan.

854
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,500
Shen Xue Shi, raise it up.

855
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
I'll do it.

856
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,500
Lady Jiang, just shoot the wine.

857
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:52,500
If you hit it, I'll reward you.

858
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Give it back.

859
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,500
This is aAPPLAUSE Leah.

860
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,800
Coming back on Toad route,

861
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,400
I wanted to give you a surprise.

862
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,520
But you didn't see it first.

863
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,760
Your Highness.

864
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,760
Your Highness.

865
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,200
It's a good thing to be alive.

866
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,400
It's good to be awake.

867
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,920
But today at the banquet,

868
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,440
Lady Jiang is so drunk.

869
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,400
I'm afraid...

870
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,000
You're the one who's talking.

871
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,000
Lady Jiang.

872
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,000
Why are you still standing there?

873
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,840
The hands of the interrogation room

874
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,280
are all for you.

875
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,000
If I'm wrong,

876
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,220
we'll think of her every bit of this.

877
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,280
Lady Jiang.

878
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,400
Don't mind my life.

879
00:45:42,280 --> 00:46:09,060
You want to go back to your original

880
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,060
Don't hesitate.

881
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,660
An Li.

882
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,140
Close your eyes.

883
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:44,860
?

884
00:46:53,980 --> 00:47:00,180
?If there's no happy memory?

885
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:07,660
?How can the sad marathon pass?

886
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:14,660
Two cold, heartless people

887
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:22,660
Holding hands, can we cross the snow?

888
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:30,660
In the cold wind, in the long night

889
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:37,660
Embracing the remaining warmth

890
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:45,660
Holding on, not firm

891
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:52,660
Can we bury the regret from yesterday?

892
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:59,660
Love is to cherish with life

893
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:07,660
Live on, even if it's a little hurt

894
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,660
No matter sorrow or joy

895
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,660
I believe you

896
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:22,660
Would rather be trapped in the coldness of the world

897
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:29,660
Live on, use up all your courage

898
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:37,660
Love until you breathe

899
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:42,660
Cross the valley of life

900
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,660
Just to meet you

901
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:57,640
After the

902
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:04,640
Love is to cherish with life
