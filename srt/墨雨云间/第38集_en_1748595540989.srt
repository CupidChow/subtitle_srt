1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't admit it

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When spring comes, I'll return to the earth

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Story of the Phoenix

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Son.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Why are you so short?

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You suddenly asked us to pack up and go back to our hometown.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I just want to keep it a secret.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll take the blame and go back to the house.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Besides me, don't be heartbroken with anyone.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Brother, what happened?

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Just listen to me.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're so drunk that you don't tell us what happened.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Can't you just let us go?

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Do you want to know what happened in the capital?

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I dare to say, do you dare to listen?

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Brother, you...

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you don't say it, then forget it.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll pack up with your sister.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Mother.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
By the way, you must be careful here.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's go.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mother.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hurry up.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The Great King of the Phoenix

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The Great King of the Phoenix

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
King of Cheng has brought so many soldiers to the capital.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Isn't this to punish the rebels?

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This book is well-written.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It has been used as a reason to limit the military forces' army to the capital.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's reasonable to be reasonable.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
His Majesty has to be reasonable.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But this is not the kind of sacrifice that King of Cheng and Princess can make.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There's still someone behind them.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's hard to say.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Is it right to say that it's the sacrifice?

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
According to the report, the army of King of Cheng has already returned.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
How can they go back to the capital in such a big way?

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Will they kill the army outside the capital?

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Shall we first guard the wall

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and take the King of Cheng down on the ground?

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In this way, His Majesty has made the crime of destroying the loyal officials.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The army of King of Cheng is outside the capital.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
In the meantime, the capital will be in chaos.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm afraid the court will be unstable.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then let's make a promise.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ye Yuanwei, look.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Is there anything else that can make me lose?

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you for your hard work.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The memorial ceremony is about the national運.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm in charge of this mission.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm in charge of the royal palace.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm lucky that you two have the right to help me.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Before the ceremony is held tomorrow,

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I will visit all the places again.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But I will be sure that everything will be fine.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will be sure that everything will be fine.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But I'm sure that everything will be fine.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We must make a promise and not go out of the pavilion.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Your Highness, someone from the capital wants to see you.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Please.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Please.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Cut off.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Keep off.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

79
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,320
He placed the first colour action that you were using.

80
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,040
You are a Polish soldier,

81
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,060
that's why your blood skills taught you more.

82
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,900
It was not true that

83
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:11,120
you actually低ed your skill so quickly.

84
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,780
Is it right?

85
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,660
Alright then.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't want to see you

87
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,600
be so reluctant.

88
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,720
The best person to be a master

89
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,840
is to kill the princess

90
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,520
and marry the emperor.

91
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,160
You dare to make such a mistake

92
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,360
and you're not afraid that I'll kill you now?

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,680
Your Highness has been in the north for many years.

94
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,160
A defeat aside.

95
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,360
You are

96
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,240
not the one I stand by.

97
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,920
You have Calm Sister

98
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,480
in return for his life.

99
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
I'm not sure.

100
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,980
How are you pre-opering the edict?

101
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,820
I an chair by seven square meters—

102
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,440
I just,

103
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,480
by the way,

104
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,060
make myself.

105
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,400
Thank you for coming.

106
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,920
later on,

107
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
I won't show up right in front of theoooo person in your face.

108
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,080
But based on your mood,

109
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,040
I won't do it.

110
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,080
That's why,

111
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,120
I don't intend to inform you

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,840
about it in advance.

113
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,560
However,

114
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:03,760
I will have you

115
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,560
tell her in the face of incredibly ill murder.

116
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,920
Sister,

117
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,760
how can we let

118
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,480
to make him angry.

119
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,560
Fine.

120
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,800
After the ceremony,

121
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,920
if he blames you,

122
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,080
I'll ask for your permission.

123
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

124
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,160
But I'm afraid that

125
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,920
you'll be

126
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,760
wronged.

127
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,200
What do you want?

128
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,200
Your Majesty.

129
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,840
Your Majesty.

130
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,200
Your Majesty.

131
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,360
Your Majesty.

132
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,000
Your Majesty.

133
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,680
Your Majesty.

134
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,880
Your Majesty.

135
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,240
Your Majesty.

136
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,920
Your Majesty.

137
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,120
Your Majesty.

138
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,400
Your Majesty.

139
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,560
Your Majesty.

140
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,520
Your Majesty.

141
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,800
Your Majesty.

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,120
Your Majesty.

143
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,120
Your Majesty.

144
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,840
I wouldn't judge you off like that

145
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,840
after looking into the skirmishing of the Jacks.

146
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,240
Do you know

147
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
how

148
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,160
Ripho Zongli Yan pode

149
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,340
has already paid

150
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,640
all his sum.

151
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,840
Granted,

152
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,160
your majesty.

153
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,920
Quickly arise,brother.

154
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,200
No need to Assistant.

155
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,880
With the power of both shores

156
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,260
of your Xianan and heifuqin

157
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,060
All places are fine.

158
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,060
If my father knows about the छ ह agreements,

159
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,820
he'll be relieved

160
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,060
by today's Lord of Great Yan.

161
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,420
I'm not aixòing the quest of Chaos solved.

162
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,220
It's a common Eb Іto.

163
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,860
His Majesty has served for a while,

164
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,340
so he accepted the marriage.

165
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,660
He will be showed

166
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,220
the power of Great Yan again...

167
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,340
If he doesn't hold the ordinary joyous trade with beauty,

168
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,700
he can be influenced

169
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,020
by all traitors.

170
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,740
I'll shop at Fang's is.

171
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,980
Your Excellency.

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,860
I will submit my adoptive order,issäz

173
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,500
I will send guards down here

174
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:15,160

Not gir

179
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,220
The crown prince should pay it well.

180
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,380
He should not.

181
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,100
Brother Chun.

182
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,900
You are the one who should pay it well.

183
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,940
You have paid $2,500 isn't it?

184
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,060
How much did you pay him that day?

185
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,780
About 16 plus cent.

186
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,200
How much did he pay?

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,560
One pound per pound.

188
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,740
To take your house or your house,

189
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,540
I'll be safe.

190
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,140
Okay.

191
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,580
You're thoughtful.

192
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,700
After the ceremony,

193
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,180
how will you stay in the capital?

194
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,780
I think

195
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,740
if father is in heaven,

196
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,900
I won't let you

197
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,300
stay in the capital forever.

198
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,220
To be honest,

199
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,660
I plan to

200
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,220
return to Beijing

201
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,820
after the ceremony is over.

202
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,780
Although the border is safe now,

203
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,460
the situation in Beijing

204
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,780
won't let me go.

205
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,900
I'm not here.

206
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,220
I'll take you to the capital

207
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,100
to avoid any trouble.

208
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,140
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

209
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,020
You're really lucky to be here.

210
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,460
Please.

211
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,060
Your Majesty, please.

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,060
Hello, Your Majesty.

213
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,820
Your Majesty.

214
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,460
horror

215
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,720
Brother,

216
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,420
You haven't seen him for a long time.

217
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,140
You've been gathered and kept troublesome.

218
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,300
I feel sorry for you.

219
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,500
You've been hanging on to you

220
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,300
for a while in the capital.

221
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,620
But you always ask me

222
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,900
for no reason.

223
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,620
Don't you think it's too much?

224
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,700
Sister,

225
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,460
don't make this up in front of me.

226
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,020
Brother,

227
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,900
I heard that His Majesty

228
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,460
gave you a lot of good things.

229
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,580
Leave now.

230
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,500
I want to talk to Princess Zhang alone.

231
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,660
Those good things

232
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,820
are just to remind me

233
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,980
to be careful and considerate.

234
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,180
Don't act rashly.

235
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,100
I've been in Beijing for so many years.

236
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,620
It's not for his sake.

237
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,820
Brother,

238
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,980
are you going to do it?

239
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,100
A fake pregnancy pill

240
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,660
will make you feel dizzy.

241
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,460
You'll be brainless if you're pregnant.

242
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,940
If you break the relationship

243
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,860
between Li Zhongnan and me,

244
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,820
you won't have a competent grand father like me.

245
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,840
Yourly這客戈在閒吵

246
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,420
to look like a stupid clever bird.

247
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,260
I don't believe

248
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,580
you ill-conscious little lover in the next life.

249
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,980
Brother,

250
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,940
you are as 6 years of age

251
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,420
and don't have any Fight Stars of Then Night

252
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,140
for your sister's good fortune

253
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,380
that cannot be explained.

254
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,540
I'm really relieved

255
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,700
that you still get the chance

256
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,700
to meet your brother.

257
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,460
You have a son who is so important to you.

258
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,860
You only love beauty and don't love the military power.

259
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,660
Let's go to worship Mother.

260
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,860
Mother, wake up!

261
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,860
Mother, I will come back.

262
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,860
Mother, you will definitely come back.

263
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,860
Mother, I don't have the family background.

264
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,860
I'm not your father's son.

265
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,860
Ever since I had you,

266
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,860
I was still a little girl

267
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,860
because of Noble Consort.

268
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,860
I was so worried about you.

269
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,860
I was so scared that I was separated from you.

270
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,860
In this palace,

271
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,860
I have seen a lot of evil and evil.

272
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,860
I also know that people are kind.

273
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,860
I am willing to let you live together

274
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,860
and take care of yourself.

275
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,860
I understand.

276
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,860
Shuo'er, Jing'er, remember.

277
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:36,860
In the palace, there is only a way to fight for the power.

278
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,860
Only the supreme power

279
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,860
can protect you.

280
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Prime Minister Li.

281
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,860
Your Highness, Princess.

282
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,860
Tell me about your plan.

283
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,860
The time is tomorrow night.

284
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,860
We need to split up.

285
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,860
Prime Minister Li.

286
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,860
Prime Minister Li, youING, you-你想

287
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,860
Li Xiangguo's actions are as great as myrieb.

288
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,860
I certainly respect you.

289
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,860
It's your honor

290
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,860
I don't know anything about this.

291
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,860
I'll introduce someone to you.

292
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,860
There are soldiers and your sister.

293
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,860
The King of the City

294
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
The King of the City

295
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,860
Brother, this is the Shen Yuru I mentioned to you.

296
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,860
Greetings, Your Highness.

297
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,860
Mr. Shen is very smart.

298
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,860
I don't know what to say.

299
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,860
I'm just a little bit worried.

300
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,860
I'm just a little bit worried.

301
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,860
I'm just a little bit worried.

302
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
I really don't know anything about this.

303
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,860
Don't worry.

304
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,860
I'll keep you safe after the trial.

305
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,860
I'll keep you safe after the trial.

306
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

307
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Long live, Your Majesty.

308
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,860
Long live, Your Majesty.

309
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,860
Are you ready?

310
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,860
I've waited for eight years.

311
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,860
Finally, I've waited for this day.

312
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,860
I feel a little bit uncomfortable.

313
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,860
A'Li, do you still remember

314
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,860
the question you asked me in the prison?

315
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,860
I didn't answer that day.

316
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,860
Now you ask me again.

317
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,860
Duke Su,

318
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,860
do you have anyone who is willing to die?

319
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,860
Yes.

320
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,860
My father led the Dragon King of the Dragon King to be a doctor.

321
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
But the King of the City

322
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,860
killed him in the city.

323
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,860
He was killed in the border.

324
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,860
I've also fought for him in the city.

325
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,860
But I couldn't prove it to him.

326
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,860
I've been thinking about this for eight years.

327
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,860
What is my father thinking

328
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,860
before he died?

329
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,860
Did he regret

330
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,860
the wrongdoings of the Wolf's Night?

331
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,860
My father is also a person who loves life and death.

332
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,860
If General Xiao is still alive,

333
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,860
they will surely be able to drink and smoke.

334
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,860
Xiao Heng,

335
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,860
you once told me

336
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,860
that you would return to ask the UK

337
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,860
and make a contribution to the country.

338
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,860
I've done it.

339
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,860
The sky is full of clouds.

340
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
I believe in the sky.

341
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,860
General Xiao will bless you

342
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,860
in the sky.

343
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,860
You've never believed in the sky.

344
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,860
You're the only one who believes in yourself.

345
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,860
No.

346
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,860
I also believe in you.

347
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,860
Please believe me.

348
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,860
For the sake of a few personal interests,

349
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,860
I've framed the City of Liang

350
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,860
to make you the so-called power

351
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,860
and send you to the Wulitan Palace.

352
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,860
In their heart,

353
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,860
the world is not a people,

354
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,860
but a power.

355
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,860
No matter if it's the sky or the human heart,

356
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,860
they will not be biased towards them.

357
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,860
And...

358
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,860
No matter what,

359
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,860
I won't be mad at you.

360
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,860
Today, I, Ruo Yao,

361
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,860
came to my house to study.

362
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,860
She said that she was in Yong Zhou.

363
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,860
This child...

364
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,860
He didn't forget to tell me

365
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,860
that he wanted me to stop working too hard.

366
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,860
He asked me to do everything at home

367
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,860
no matter what.

368
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,860
I did everything I could.

369
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,860
Really.

370
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,860
Mother,

371
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

372
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,860
If I hadn't promised

373
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,860
to be the governor of this country,

374
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
would our country

375
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,860
be another kind of capital?

376
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,860
You're a teacher of Ye'er.

377
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,860
You taught him all his knowledge.

378
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,860
His character can be used more to make people happy.

379
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,860
Now,

380
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,860
I'm going to put him

381
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,860
in the most dangerous position.

382
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,860
I'm going to put him in the most dangerous position.

383
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,860
I'm going to put him in the most dangerous position.

384
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,860
I'm going to think about your position.

385
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,860
I'm going to think about your position.

386
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,860
I'm going to listen to His Majesty's order.

387
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,860
Just seal your name in the letter.

388
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,860
I'll help him grow up

389
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,860
when I die.

390
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,860
I'll help him grow up.

391
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,860
I'll help him grow up.

392
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,860
Your Majesty,

393
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,860
I actually...

394
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,860
Accept it.

395
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
Old man,

396
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:03,860
take a look at the relationship between you and my emperor.

397
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,860
I...

398
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,860
I'm grateful to you.

399
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,860
I'm not a man of the high position.

400
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,860
I'm a minister of the imperial court.

401
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,860
If I can't protect the emperor,

402
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
I'll kill the emperor.

403
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,860
If I'm too strong,

404
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,860
I'll make the emperor remember me.

405
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,860
I'll kill the emperor.

406
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,860
I'll kill the emperor.

407
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,860
I'll kill the emperor.

408
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,860
I'll die in the place of the funeral.

409
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,860
So,

410
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,860
I gave the emperor a hand

411
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,860
after I gave the emperor a gift.

412
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,860
I gave the emperor a hand

413
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,860
to Li Zhongnan.

414
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,860
We are true to each other.

415
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,860
We are each other's eyes.

416
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,860
We are equal in the capital.

417
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,860
I can't tell you

418
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,860
what happened in my heart.

419
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,860
It's just that I'm really

420
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,860
worried about nothing.

421
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,860
Nothing else.

422
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,860
It's just that the little people in my family

423
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,860
are so sad.

424
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,860
They're so sad.

425
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,860
It's all my fault.

426
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,860
You can understand.

427
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,860
But

428
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,860
you suddenly told me about the imperial court.

429
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,860
Did Prince Cheng return to the capital?

430
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,860
He's not here.

431
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,860
If he's

432
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,860
wrong,

433
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,860
what do you want?

434
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,860
I've made a choice.

435
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,860
I won't let you down

436
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,860
if you leave me alone.

437
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,860
I've been hoping

438
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,860
that you'd be prepared.

439
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,860
If I...

440
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,860
If I'm not

441
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,860
good enough,

442
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,860
please help me

443
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,860
to save the Jiang family.

444
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,860
I'll take care of the Jiang family.

445
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,860
Don't worry.

446
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,860
These years,

447
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,860
I've been suffering for you.

448
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,860
I've been suffering for you.

449
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,860
Seeing you like this,

450
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,860
I think of someone.

451
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,860
Who?

452
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,860
Jiang, Jiang.

453
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,860
Your son finally

454
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,860
has grown up.

455
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,860
I'll take care of him.

456
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:39,060
du bling hang

457
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,060
Hahahaha

458
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,840
Hahahaha

459
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,000
but I'll not agreed to the bow of Baiqing now

460
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,640
But I still believe in the overall situation

461
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,400
But switch back

462
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,760
in one of which

463
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,960
Supreme King of Chenmu wants the quarter

464
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,940
there's a bride

465
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,320
who's going to be the Solider

466
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,620
No

467
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,340
We are all safe

468
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,920
We need your complimentary

469
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,440
as well

470
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,400
Goo

471
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,540
That's too detest

472
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,700
If His Majesty falls,

473
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,700
the first one to die

474
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,380
is our Jiang family.

475
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,980
No.

476
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,820
Pack up and go to your mother's secret.

477
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,660
Pack up.

478
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,140
Grandma.

479
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,460
Pack up.

480
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,660
Your Majesty.

481
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,220
The night outside is ready.

482
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,540
Tomorrow, you need to leave at midnight.

483
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,140
The time is too late.

484
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,100
The city is warm.

485
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,100
The time is 5.53 pm.

486
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,380
The time is too late.

487
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,700
You need to go back to the palace to enjoy the night.

488
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,980
Su Niguang.

489
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,340
How long have you been with me?

490
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,020
Since His Majesty's arrival,

491
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,340
it's been more than ten years.

492
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,540
After tomorrow,

493
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,420
if I still sit on this chair,

494
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,860
I will reward you later.

495
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,980
I beg Your Majesty to rest in peace.

496
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,020
Your Majesty.

497
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,580
Consort Li.

498
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,300
Your Majesty.

499
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,420
I insisted on coming back.

500
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,460
Su Niguang, please leave.

501
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,860
Your Majesty.

502
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,980
Don't hide it from me.

503
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,260
Tomorrow,

504
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,860
will Prince Cheng and the others come?

505
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,980
Or

506
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,580
why do you suddenly ask me to leave the palace?

507
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,620
There's nothing to do.

508
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,820
Listen to me.

509
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,700
You go first.

510
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,820
I won't leave.

511
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,820
If you don't leave, I won't be at ease.

512
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,140
If I'm not here at this time,

513
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,700
Prince Cheng won't be suspicious?

514
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,700
I must stay.

515
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,140
Do you know

516
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,380
that the night is still

517
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,980
because of what?

518
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,500
It's because I know

519
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,060
that I must stay with His Majesty

520
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,300
and go face to face with His Majesty.

521
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,820
I don't agree.

522
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,340
Your Majesty.

523
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,900
Your Majesty.

524
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,540
If I'm in the enemy's hands,

525
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,900
I will never

526
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,900
contact His Majesty.

527
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,140
Consort Li.

528
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,260
Your Majesty.

529
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,100
Don't accidents happen just in time?

530
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,700
Isn't that aそう?

531
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,900
I won't forget you.

532
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,300
I won't forget you.

533
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,740
If you want to rest,

534
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,740
I will risk this thing for you.

535
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,940
Give my bride a massage

536
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,300
with her hair.

537
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,980
Can you try?

538
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,180
Give it out.

539
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,340
You decide.

540
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,420
Mother.

541
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,500
I have got a deep question.

542
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,080
with the holy plays and 시aking Son Hubert slip-offs and Proschen Disease is a recent selection.

543
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,720
Ponder your fate while keeping your eyes on it.

544
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,100
On this day, we worship the holy works.

545
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,640
Greetings to theSp submit!

546
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,260
Father actually taught for this King Premium he was walking towards.

547
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,020
No matter what, I won't allow anybody

548
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,740
that you went to steal this place.

549
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,620
Old man,

550
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,900
you should keep a careful look on them.

551
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,700
Who is in this world?

552
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,260
Stop.

553
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,660
When the sky and earth know that the silver and silver sparked the like of the East,

554
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,580
When the earth and earth know that the 오i grain separated and wasted the light,

555
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,220
The Holy God is called.

556
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,700
It's a great day and night.

557
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,340
It's a great day and night.

558
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,900
It's a great day and night.

559
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,700
It's a great day and night.

560
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,580
Leave.

561
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,980
Yes.

562
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,300
Father.

563
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,660
You're back.

564
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,460
Good.

565
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,460
Are you comforting me

566
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,540
or yourself?

567
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,460
You sent me to Daiguo.

568
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,860
Do you know what kind of life I will have?

569
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,140
I live in the Yang Juan every day.

570
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,740
I'm insulted and insulted.

571
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,300
I don't deserve to be a father.

572
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,340
Qing'er.

573
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,020
Princess.

574
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,220
Father.

575
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,620
I don't deserve to be a person.

576
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,860
I'm the anger in Yang Juan.

577
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,180
My Qing'er.

578
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,940
It's hard for me.

579
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,620
Actually, I'm in Daiguo every day.

580
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,180
I don't want to be a father.

581
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,860
Every day, I think about it.

582
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,860
One day, you will come to Daiguo to pick me up.

583
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,620
Every day, I think about it.

584
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,260
You will love me when you were young and hurt me and hug me.

585
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,300
Your daughter is back.

586
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,740
Princess An Ning is back.

587
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,300
Father.

588
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,300
I'm sorry.

589
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,060
Father.

590
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,100
I also want to ask you.

591
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,700
Other than loving yourself

592
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,460
and your son,

593
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,020
have you ever loved your son?

594
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,580
Qing'er, don't say that.

595
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,060
Back then, they asked me

596
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,900
to put me in the fire.

597
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,020
Father.

598
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,900
The question I asked was

599
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,820
whether you loved me or not.

600
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,580
Father.

601
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,540
You should take the medicine.

602
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,260
After taking the medicine,

603
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,500
your illness will be better.

604
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,140
Oh, my head is dirty.

605
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,740
I'll change it for you.

606
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,340
Come on.

607
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:41,940
Qing'er.

608
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,180
Qing'er.

609
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,740
Father.

610
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,460
You wronged me first.

611
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,260
You have halves of them in your hands.

612
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,900
Eat forward.

613
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,780
We didn't know this was a real accident.

614
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,340
The matter is Top-Level Allys

615
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,940
and it could have been dangerous.

616
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,780
You want to know

617
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,380
who the amen is.

618
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,700
Looking backwards

619
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,020
I heard Prince and his imperial mother

620
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,500
were busy and Yao for generations

621
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,780
They were fervent

622
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,960
We all were welcomed here

623
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,260
So hope Tribe Tea can be for years

624
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,420
Your Majesty, you must have it.

625
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,500
The Northern Army or the Central Army

626
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
are all family members.

627
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,220
They are all different.

628
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,020
Brother, go back and rest for a while.

629
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,140
You won't be back until dinner.

630
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,940
Duke Su.

631
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,060
Yes.

632
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,660
It's been almost nine years.

633
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,260
I didn't expect you to be so tall.

634
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,540
I remember when I left the capital,

635
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,180
you were here.

636
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,980
If your parents were still here,

637
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,940
they would see your current appearance

638
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,460
and feel happy.

639
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,020
My father was unlucky.

640
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,220
He couldn't survive on the battlefield.

641
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,620
If he saw the success of the King of the City,

642
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,500
he should be very lucky.

643
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,380
Thank you, General Xiao.

644
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,460
If he hadn't come to support me,

645
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,340
I wouldn't have been able to take over the city.

646
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,580
It's a pity that

647
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,380
I can't get through

648
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,860
the valley.

649
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,420
I also...

650
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,260
I feel very Racing and pain.

651
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,580
You are all elderly fans.

652
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,100
You don't need to care about how they should be doing.

653
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,740
Nothing to invest.

654
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,140
You told me to stop after looking.

655
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,740
Tomorrow there will be an opportunity to see them back.

656
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,820
But a pack like this

657
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,820
doesn't take so long.

658
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,180
It's too bad.

659
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,260
好的?

660
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,260
Hope you won't

661
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:53,900
Please.

662
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,900
peace and stability are the most important.

663
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,900
Why can't you go with yourself?

664
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,900
When it's late night,

665
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,900
I'll ask Xian Zhi for help.

666
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,900
I hope that we can meet again when the time comes.

667
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,900
Of course.

668
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,900
God, I'm not very lucky.

669
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,900
People often say that there must be a fortune in the south.

670
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,900
I escaped before.

671
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,900
If there is a fortune in the future,

672
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,900
please give this blessing to Xiao Heng.

673
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
You two, go to the Western Courtyard to watch.

674
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,900
You two, go to the Eastern Courtyard.

675
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,900
Yes.

676
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,900
Is something going on?

677
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,900
Why is the house being closed?

678
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,900
Lord Xue Lang, don't worry.

679
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,900
The house is normally closed.

680
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,900
It's not safe for people.

681
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
How is my sister doing?

682
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,900
You don't have to hide it from me.

683
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,900
I'm fine.

684
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,900
You can't lie to me.

685
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,900
You just need to stay in the house for a few days.

686
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,900
There are arrangements for you.

687
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,900
There are security guards in the State Palace.

688
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,900
They won't let you get 10,000 yuan.

689
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,900
Let's go.

690
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,900
I'll trouble you tonight.

691
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,900
Don't worry, Madam.

692
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,900
Duke Su has arranged it.

693
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,900
There is no security guard outside the house.

694
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,900
Master.

695
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,900
I'm in a hurry to see you, Zhao Ke.

696
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,900
I'm not at home these days.

697
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,900
No one is looking for flowers in the garden.

698
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,900
I just found a problem with a flower.

699
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,900
Can you go over and have a look?

700
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,900
Madam, you're not old.

701
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,900
You're still young.

702
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,900
I don't understand you now, right?

703
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,900
I'll give you a hand.

704
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,900
You're still young.

705
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,900
I'll go with you.

706
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,900
Look at you.

707
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,900
You're so pretty.

708
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,900
What a pity.

709
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
This is the only thing my mother left for me.

710
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,900
You must save her for me.

711
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,900
I think I smell something.

712
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,900
Is it the root of the root?

713
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,900
Ask.

714
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
It looks like

715
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,900
the innocent innocent in the sun.

716
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
I'll move it back to the place of the cold.

717
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,900
Then I'll add some fertilizer.

718
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,900
It'll be good in a few days.

719
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,900
Of course.

720
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,900
No, no, no.

721
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,900
It must be the root of the root.

722
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,900
You should ask.

723
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,900
Come, come, come.

724
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,900
Master.

725
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,900
Madam is waiting for me.

726
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,900
I'll take my leave.

727
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,900
Rourke.

728
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,900
Madam, the letter from the Emperor of the State.

729
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
Madam, the letter from the Emperor of the State.

730
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,900
Madam, what happened?

731
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,900
Duke Su asked me to visit the Imperial Palace.

732
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,900
He said there was something important to talk to you.

733
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,900
I'm looking for you at this time.

734
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,900
Why don't you go tomorrow?

735
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,900
At this time,

736
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,900
he must have something to tell me about the Khebu Dragon Ring.

737
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,900
Bai Xue.

738
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,900
Bai Xue.

739
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,900
Bai Xue.

740
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,900
Bai Xue.

741
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,900
Bai Xue.

742
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,900
Bai Xue.

743
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
Bai Xue.

744
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,900
Bai Xue.

745
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
Bai Xue.

746
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,900
Bai Xue.

747
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
Bai Xue.

748
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,900
You go down first.

749
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,900
Yes.

750
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,900
Come with me to the Imperial Palace.

751
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,900
Yes.

752
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,900
Yes.

753
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,900
LeavingQu Forget to send.

754
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,900
Keep up with me.

755
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,900
Bye.

756
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,900
Don't tell him now.

757
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,900
Eat the chicken.

758
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,900
All of it.

759
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,900
Xuelu.

760
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,940
How long will it take?

761
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,060
Two ladies,

762
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,980
and a pig.

763
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,820
Two ladies?

764
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,820
I wonder what you have in mind.

765
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,060
Ladies.

766
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,580
Is this Zhao Ke?

767
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:02,900
Zhao Ke.

768
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,700
You send the letter to the Palace of Justice

769
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,820
on a daily basis.

770
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,860
Why did you give him the white blood?

771
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,980
I was helping him with the flowers this afternoon.

772
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,380
I didn't find the person who sent the letter.

773
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,980
There is indeed a problem.

774
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,820
Stop the car.

775
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,140
Come on, slow down.

776
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,980
Zhao Ke, just wait for me here.

777
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,180
I'll go and buy something.

778
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,100
It seems that the second lady has already lost her mind.

779
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,380
Let go of me!

780
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,300
Help!

781
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,420
Help!

782
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,660
Help!

783
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,500
Let go of me!

784
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:58,700
Let go of me!

785
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,180
Let go of me!

786
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:33,860
Let go of me!

787
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,460
Let go of me!

788
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,100
Let go of me!

789
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,780
Let go of me!

790
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,340
Let go of me!

791
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,060
Let go of me!

792
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,620
Let go of me!

793
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,100
Let go of me!

794
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,580
Let go of me!

795
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,100
Let go of me!

796
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:39,620
Let go of me!

797
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,180
Let go of me!

798
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:40,740
Let go of me!

799
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,220
Let go of me!

800
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:41,780
Let go of me!

801
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,340
Let go of me!

802
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:42,820
Let go of me!

803
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,300
Let go of me!

804
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:43,860
Let go of me!

805
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,420
Let go of me!

806
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:44,820
Let go of me!

807
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,300
Let go of me!

808
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:45,780
Let go of me!

809
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,340
Let go of me!

810
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:46,820
Let go of me!

811
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,380
Let go of me!

812
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:47,940
Let go of me!

813
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,420
Let go of me!

814
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:48,980
Let go of me!

815
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,460
Let go of me!

816
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:49,940
Let go of me!

817
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,340
Let go of me!

818
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,540
How do you feel?

819
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,540
Who is he?

820
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,820
His breath and the dragon tree

821
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,340
have not been broken by anyone.

822
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,300
You are

823
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,980
quite powerful.

824
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,540
What do you want to do with me now?

825
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,780
Of course, you have to

826
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,700
do something about my fake pregnancy.

827
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,780
But this thing

828
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,460
can wait for Xiao Heng to come.

829
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,380
Let him

830
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,700
take a good look at your下.

831
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,380
How about it?

832
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,860
He even handed out the dragon army.

833
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,820
He is not in danger to you.

834
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,220
Why do you still keep him from letting go?

835
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,700
You are in this world.

836
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,860
You are in this world.

837
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,420
You are still worried about him?

838
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,740
Your true feelings

839
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,620
really make people want to cry.

840
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,380
Do you know the taste of the child's death?

841
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,900
Do you know how painful it is

842
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,180
to break someone's hope?

843
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:15,940
I don't know.

844
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,620
But I know

845
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,580
what the smell of death

846
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,700
is that of someone who is loved by the people.

847
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:22,980
Consort Xue,

848
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,580
sometimes I really like you.

849
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,220
If it weren't for Shen Yurong,

850
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,300
we would really be friends.

851
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,420
I will never be your friend

852
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,740
to a disgusting person like you.

853
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,860
I know you want to anger me.

854
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,180
But before Xiao Heng comes,

855
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,180
I won't touch you with a cold shoulder.

856
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,540
I just want to see

857
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,060
you two suffer together.

858
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,300
You are my disgusting person.

859
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,700
If you were to replace me,

860
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,260
you would not hate me more than I do.

861
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,060
You hate me more?

862
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,860
You are really great with Shen Yurong.

863
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,700
You use the same excuse to make up for yourself.

864
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,580
That's why I like him.

865
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,940
Your gentle husband

866
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,340
finally got me into a mess.

867
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,460
He should be like me.

868
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,260
I will never be your friend.

869
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,860
I will never be your friend.

870
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,860
I will never be your friend.

871
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,860
I will never be your friend.

872
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,860
I will never be your friend.

873
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,860
I will never be your friend.

874
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,860
I will never be your friend.

875
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,860
I will never be your friend.

876
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,860
I will never be your friend.

877
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,860
I will never be your friend.

878
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,860
I will never be your friend.

879
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,860
I will never be your friend.

880
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,860
I will never be your friend.

881
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,860
I will never be your friend.

882
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,860
I will never be your friend.

883
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,180
I will never be your friend.

884
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,180
I will never be your friend.

885
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,180
I will never be your friend.

886
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,180
I will never be your friend.

887
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,180
I will never be your friend.

888
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,940
I will never be your friend.

889
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,940
What kind of title do you have?

890
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,940
I am a young disciple ofpture.

891
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,780
Have you ever seen?

892
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:18,580
Those who saw through my exterior within

893
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,460
by nothing in order to succeed me

894
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,980
I'm not afraid of the cold

895
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,460
I'm not afraid of the cold

896
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,580
I'm not afraid of the cold

897
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,460
I'm not afraid of the cold

898
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,460
I'm not afraid of the cold

899
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,460
I'm not afraid of the cold

900
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:44,460
I'm not afraid of the cold

901
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,460
I'm not afraid of the cold

902
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:55,460
Can you bury the traces of yesterday?

903
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:02,460
Love is going, and life is going to be true

904
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:10,460
If it continues, even if it's a little bit of a shock

905
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,460
No matter how much I'm hurt or confused

906
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,460
I believe in you

907
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:25,460
The more you're trapped in the world

908
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:32,460
I want to keep my courage

909
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:40,460
Love continues until we both breathe

910
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:45,460
The more I'm through, the more I feel

911
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,460
I only want to meet you

912
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:55,460
After the cup, I won't be far away

913
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:05,460
After the cup, I won't be far away
