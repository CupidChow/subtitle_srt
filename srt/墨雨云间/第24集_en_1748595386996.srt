1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad things

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly hold the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I wait for spring to return to my home

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I heard that the wife of Shen's school used to be the first talent in Huaixiang

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I was curious and went there to see

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Indeed, the appearance of Mrs. Shen is unique

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But she has little time

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So when I saw the second wife, she was very big

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Because she looks the same as Xue Fangfei

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Your Majesty

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Have you ever heard that there are two people who are not married

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But they look the same?

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Since there is a family of three at the same time, they are often separated

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They are not even a coincidence

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry that the second wife who lived in Zhengyu Hall for ten years

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Finally, she is finally married and is going back to her home

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But she is so cruel and cruel

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Even the father of the second wife, Zhong Shulin, is also in the valley

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Your Highness, what do you mean?

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Please explain

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why does a eight-year-old girl live in Zhengyu Hall for ten years

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No one can teach her but she can win the title of the noble family in the capital

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She is a woman of the world

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There are so many people in the world who are suffering

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why does the second wife not believe in everything and take the price?

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
She is going to go to the world to save Xue Huaiyao

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The only explanation is that she is pretending to be a woman

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You are not Jiang Li, you are Xue Fangfei

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What do you mean?

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is the price of seven thousand

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This is the price of seven thousand

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is the price of seven thousand

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Your Highness, if I am the Xue Fangfei you mentioned

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Then the Huaixiang people who followed me to the capital

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't know

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Xue Fangfei grew up in Huaixiang

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Of course the Huaixiang people won't admit their mistakes

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can ask someone

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
See if I am Xue Fangfei or Jiang Li

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
People who can go to the capital with you to tell the public

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Of course they are all good friends

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If you don't mind to ask

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I think it's okay

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Those who dare to go to the capital to tell the public

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Are the people who will die and die

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Do you still want them to suffer the same fate as now?

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Everyone take a look

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She is still the one who protects Huaixiang

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Your Majesty

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The Chen and Huaixiang people are not so hard-working

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Only to make a good official to be free

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Chen Nv

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't know how my appearance offended the young princess

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
She wants to force people like this

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Take a person who is a good official

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Want to be my brother

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Jiang Erniangzi's ability to bite a bite

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Really great

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's just that I'm not interested in your life

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I just want to be the minister of the middle school

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And those who are thrown by you

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
People who are not fair

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Especially the emperor

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The heart of Minxu Liangchen is so sincere

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Make people fall in

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Unfortunately, it's just that they are used

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Xue Huaiyuan has just found out

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Chen Nv said

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't know what the use of the word

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is from where

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Or

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Where did the princess hear that I am a Consort Xue

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Such a ridiculous word

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't worry

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Wait a minute and let you meet your old master

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Dali Siking

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's announce my witness

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Announce witness

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Greetings to your majesty

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is the first needle of the ten-year-old

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Lady Jiang Erniangzi's real daughter

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Tang's master

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Although the first needle was made by the emperor

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But the wife of the second lady

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's also a big deal

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So I borrowed the first needle from the old man

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I found out one interesting thing

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't know what it is

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know what it is

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't know what it is

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I don't know who made the first needle

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I put this first needle

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The master

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The person who closed the door

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
In order to find someone

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I wasted a lot of time

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But this matter is not urgent

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I can investigate it later

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Now

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's still important to recognize someone

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
First needle

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You have to look carefully

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Is this person Jiang Li?

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Your majesty

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This person

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's not Jiang Li

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You have to look carefully

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If you dare to talk nonsense

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I cut your tongue

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I grew up from Jiang Li

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Eight years old

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He is 18 years old

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Even if he turns into a ghost

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I know him

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
He is not Jiang Li

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
According to your statement

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Where is Jiang Li?

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm afraid

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I have to ask the wife of the Xue family

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Master

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You said I am not Jiang Li

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Then where is the real Jiang Li

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's you

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Killed

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Really

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If you say

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I killed the real Jiang Li

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then how did I kill him?

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Where is his body?

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Where is his body?

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You scared me

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You have already lost your memory

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't know

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The person who came to the female hall

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Is me

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Why didn't you take off my clothes?

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I was confused

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Because you are so strong

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
When you become the second wife of the family

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Will help me to get off the blame

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I helped you to forgive

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So this is the reason you come to slander me

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What?

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I slander you

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You really have a mouth

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Your Majesty

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The real girl hall master is heartbroken

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Once I was with someone

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's natural for such a person to speak

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Now

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Someone must have used their strength

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
To slander me and get me out of the blame

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Please investigate

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No, I'm telling the truth

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You are not

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can't tell me how I killed Jiang Li

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Second, you can't tell me

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Where is the real Jiang Li

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why did you slander me

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Moreover

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
How could a woman in the female hall

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Speak out

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The maid I have

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
She grew up with me

179
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You should say she was also slandered

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You are the same

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
My father knows that Tong Er is loyal to me

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He is angry at the future of the Jiang family

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The future of the Jiang family

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Followed me to the real girl hall

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If I were a good person

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
How would she let me go

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I remind you

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No matter who slandered you

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You have to remember

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Whether you succeed today

191
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Your next scene will not fall

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You opened your mouth before the rain

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You are a fool

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You are a fool

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You still are a fool

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You will be tongue-in-tongued

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So you only have to wake up early

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And admit your mistakes

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's the end

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You are such a clever woman

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You are so black

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You are so black

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It seems that the princess

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Is not willing to believe what I said

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
In fact, the real girl hall

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Except for the master

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And others can prove

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I am the real Jiang Li

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Who

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Why don't you ask others

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The person in my hand

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Sent a message

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Said that the real girl hall master

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Was locked up in the meeting city

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Was brought out

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Looks like someone is here today

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Thank you for your warning

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you have any idea how to deal with it

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
No one can use it

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't know if the real girl hall

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Can you find someone for me

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Who

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
A real girl hall's real girl

224
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Tell me her name

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll ask Lu Qi to find her

226
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,800
So maybe

227
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Very straightforward

228
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,000
Most of us call this

229
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The real girl hall master

230
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Your huh

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You are a satisfied hero

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,280
But this is the only chance you can forgive.

233
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,120
It's a punishment for your previous actions.

234
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,320
I apologize for all the things I've done.

236
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm sorry, Second Madam.

237
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,880
What are you talking about?

238
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,920
What are you talking about?

239
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,440
She's not Jiang Li!

240
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,360
She's Jiang Li!

241
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,960
She's Jiang Li!

242
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,960
You're lying!

243
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,240
She's not Jiang Li!

244
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,720
She's not Jiang Li!

245
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,760
She's Jiang Li!

246
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,400
What's wrong with her?

247
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,360
Second Madam.

248
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,560
How could you say that?

249
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,640
I can't do this.

250
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,440
I'm sorry.

251
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,560
I can't say that.

252
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,160
Second Madam.

253
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,840
No!

254
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,600
I can't say that.

255
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
Second Madam.

256
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,800
She's not Jiang Li!

257
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,840
She's not!

258
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,640
Second Madam.

259
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,440
She's not Jiang Li!

260
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,160
I can't blame Your Majesty!

261
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,680
You can't!

262
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,640
She's not Jiang Li!

263
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,080
You're really a good man.

264
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,840
You made these people lie to you.

265
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,960
Very good.

266
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,960
Shen Xue Shi.

267
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,360
You and your wife have been together for so many years.

268
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,120
You're not blind, are you?

269
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,000
Is this Shen who you want to

270
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,640
share your life with?

271
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,200
Wan Ning.

272
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,720
Don't make a fool of yourself.

273
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,800
Is she your wife?

274
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,240
She's not.

275
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,120
She's not.

276
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,520
Shen Yu Rong, what are you saying?

277
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,800
How could she not be Xue Fang Fei?

278
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,880
You're lying.

279
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,880
She's definitely Xue Fang Fei!

280
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,800
Your Highness.

281
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,400
My wife is dead.

282
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,120
Even if she's the same as her,

283
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,000
she won't be her.

284
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,440
Shen Yu Rong, are you blind?

285
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,120
You can't recognize your wife!

286
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

287
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

288
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,240
Don't be suspicious of her.

289
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,440
I can't recognize my wife.

290
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,560
Then open the coffin!

291
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,640
Yanku!

292
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,920
Wang Qi is deep in the mountain.

293
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,960
I can't find her anywhere.

294
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,720
I can only make a cloth for her.

295
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,360
Your Highness,

296
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,480
what are you doing?

297
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,680
Who said I'd be the one to blame?

298
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,440
Xue Fang Fei is standing here.

299
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,480
And the real Jiang Li

300
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,280
has been killed by her

301
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,480
and buried in the mountain.

302
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,800
Your Highness, I forgot.

303
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,200
I've never been to the Zhengyu Hall

304
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,720
since I was a child.

305
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,840
The sword is sharp.

306
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,000
Its depth of range is limited.

307
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,880
The现-embracing people

308
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,640
always blame their crime.

309
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:30,360
No matter how much they

310
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,480
supposed to murder Fan Sha,

311
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,640
the offending person has been pelosent מש to hear my reviews now.

312
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,600
You've saved many people.

313
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Why do you need to

314
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,680
save her?

315
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,760
Why would you

316
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,280
risk Speaking of becoming a doctor

317
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,600
You can find that shadow.

318
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,520
As long as you open the tomb,

319
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,760
let the five of you sit for a night,

320
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,200
you'll know who is your biological daughter.

321
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,400
Father,

322
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,160
it seems that the princess of today

323
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,200
won't let me go.

324
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,040
Guards.

325
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,000
Go to Mount Qingcheng right now.

326
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,600
Bring that woman back.

327
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,200
Since the princess said this to Fu'er,

328
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I need to give my father an explanation.

329
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,800
Because of my father's daughter,

330
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
because of me,

331
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,880
my father is in trouble.

332
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,680
Jiang family is not yours.

333
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,520
I really owe my father.

334
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,920
Don't be so concerned about the emperor.

335
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,160
I'm just a little bit sad for Jiang family.

336
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,400
Then thank you, princess.

337
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,280
At this moment,

338
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,400
you're so worried about Jiang family.

339
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,680
If so,

340
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,840
then let's sit down.

341
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,880
No need.

342
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,640
I have nothing to do with you.

343
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,880
Now,

344
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,280
you care so much about Jiang family.

345
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,680
I'm so worried about you.

346
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,160
But

347
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,360
I haven't reached the end of my life.

348
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,920
Of course, I can recognize my own daughter.

349
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,320
Is it really not

350
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,760
the prime minister's order

351
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,640
that he doesn't want to know who is his biological daughter?

352
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,120
This is a crime of deceit.

353
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,680
Your Highness,

354
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,440
I know my daughter

355
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,320
partly got las Marly네

356
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,160
I've offended many people.

357
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,240
But

358
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,680
my daughter,

359
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,960
shocked and upset the people.

360
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,840
Which is full of excuses.

361
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,680
Of course,

362
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
I can't be in love with Qi Hou.

363
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,880
If I can't even have foot recommendations,

364
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,440
I don't think I can ever get away

365
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,800
with myself as being there.

366
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,840
I don't have to face

367
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,080
my ancestors and ancestors again.

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,080
Of all the family affairs in Jiang family,

369
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,080
and you shouldn't waste His Majesty's time.

370
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,400
Since Xue Huaiyuan has been in a secluded state,

371
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,200
I'll take my daughter home.

372
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,200
Prime Minister Jiang,

373
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,600
I must take this stock today.

374
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,440
Enough!

375
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,640
Your Majesty,

376
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
you're the emperor.

377
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,240
How can you be so blind to these people?

378
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,360
What's your status?

379
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,120
Wan Ning,

380
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,960
I've already tolerated you.

381
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,880
If you continue,

382
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,320
you'll be in great trouble.

383
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,640
Today, you've been punished for your good behavior.

384
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,280
You've been in the court

385
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,840
without any remorse.

386
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,000
You're wrong.

387
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,080
Guards!

388
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,200
Take Princess Zhang back to the Palace of Princesses.

389
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,840
Let go of me!

390
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,360
Let go of me!

391
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,320
Let go of me!

392
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,440
Let go of me!

393
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,920
I'm the Princess of the Great Yan.

394
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,280
How dare you touch me?

395
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,240
Take her away!

396
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,880
Zhao Ye,

397
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,200
how dare you touch me?

398
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,240
The ceremony is over.

399
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,800
If Princess Zhang doesn't leave,

400
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,440
she'll be in trouble.

401
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,440
Princess Xue!

402
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
What's going on?

403
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,240
Princess!

404
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,160
Your Majesty,

405
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,280
how dare you!

406
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,560
From today on,

407
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,320
without my order,

408
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,000
Princess Zhang can't leave the Palace of Princesses.

409
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
The ceremony ends here.

410
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,000
Let go of me!

411
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,480
Xu Fengfei, wait for me!

412
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,840
Don't think about it.

413
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,040
It's really a great ceremony.

414
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,480
It's really a great ceremony.

415
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,640
It's really a great ceremony.

416
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,840
It's really a great ceremony.

417
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,020
Your Majesty,

418
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,520
and by all means,

419
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,380
a big REALLY.

420
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,660
Come.

421
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,000
Father,

422
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,240
I've got a favor to wish you on.

423
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,000
Tell me.

424
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,120
Forget about Demon Voyager at the связel rot too.

425
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
If such a big thing happens,

426
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,120
you must go to the mountain to deal with it.

427
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,120
After that, you can come back.

428
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,120
By then, we should have a good talk.

429
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,120
Yes, father.

430
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
You remember well.

431
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,120
You are the daughter of the Jiang family.

432
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,920
Myopenly smarter brother!

433
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,120
Older brother!

434
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,900
19

435
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,120
While you relax and sleep,

436
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,080
you can come and discover undamaged mission by yourself.

437
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,380
No, not by myself.

438
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,940
What are you doing here,

439
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,700
time for a bad question?

440
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,820
Yes, I'm in the nightingale.

441
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,780
There is a powder on the mountain in the capital.

442
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,540
It's the powder from the buried bones.

443
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,580
I want Duke Su to help me dig it out.

444
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,500
To rest in peace.

445
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,300
Who buried it inside?

446
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,380
Why didn't you go there yourself?

447
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Duke Su.

448
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,260
You are interrogating me.

449
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,780
You can think so.

450
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,460
Forget it.

451
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,860
Just pretend that I haven't opened the door.

452
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,460
Wait.

453
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,700
I can dig it out for you.

454
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,220
It's just that the road in the capital is far away.

455
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
It's boring.

456
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,660
I don't want to go alone.

457
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,260
What do you mean?

458
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
Follow me.

459
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,100
I'll go alone.

460
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,060
Why did you bring me here?

461
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,100
I guess you want to go here to say goodbye.

462
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,740
I just want to forget this place.

463
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,780
Since you want to forget this place,

464
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,100
why did you leave?

465
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,980
I know.

466
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,620
Isn't the buried one

467
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,940
Xue Fangfei?

468
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,060
Xue Fangfei

469
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,100
is an impure girl in the world.

470
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,780
She has been living a miserable life.

471
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,380
Now that Princess is already in the face of anger,

472
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,220
I must take her dead body away.

473
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,460
I don't want others to disturb her.

474
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,580
What about you?

475
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,020
I don't want to disturb her either.

476
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,620
She is obviously a very clean person.

477
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,020
She is obviously a good person.

478
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,660
She thinks what she loves is a spiritual power.

479
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,100
She is a good person.

480
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,460
She just wants to live with her.

481
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,260
For this,

482
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,140
she gave everything out.

483
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,260
Including herself,

484
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,700
her family,

485
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,740
but in the end,

486
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,140
she was alone in this cold place.

487
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
What else?

488
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,660
She is obviously a noble woman.

489
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,260
She is obviously a good woman.

490
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,820
She didn't kill anyone.

491
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,540
She just wanted to go home.

492
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,460
For this,

493
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,900
she waited for ten years in Qingcheng Mountain.

494
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,100
Ten years!

495
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,220
But in the end,

496
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,300
she was also in this place.

497
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,780
I didn't protect her.

498
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,700
You have done a good job.

499
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,700
She won't blame you.

500
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,700
You are a good person for Xue's family.

501
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,700
You forced Jiang Yuan to accept her daughter.

502
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,700
You also wronged the people for Huai Xiang.

503
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,700
As a chess piece,

504
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,700
I am very satisfied with you.

505
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,700
What else do you want to say to her?

506
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
I have said everything.

507
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
Then I will let her do her job.

508
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
She will go to the valley.

509
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,700
Duke Su,

510
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,700
thank you for keeping me safe.

511
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
So, Li,

512
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,700
from now on,

513
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
you don't need to fear anyone.

514
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,700
No need to fear anyone.

515
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
Da Hong, thank you.

516
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,700
Boss, two.

517
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Boss,

518
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
this one.

519
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,700
Do you like this one or this one?

520
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,700
I think this one is better.

521
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
This one.

522
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,700
Jiang Yuan,

523
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
this one.

524
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,700
Shen Xue Shi.

525
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Jiang Yuan looks good today.

526
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,700
She is good at chess.

527
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,700
Because I want to know something.

528
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
I am willing to ask.

529
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
Shen Xue Shi's wife

530
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,700
saved my life in the first line of life and death.

531
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,700
I didn't understand it.

532
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
A man who is self-sacrificing,

533
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,700
why did you pull me back from hell?

534
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,700
I used to think it was because of hatred.

535
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
I was not good at it.

536
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,700
I was heartless.

537
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
He didn't want to believe me.

538
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
Now I understand.

539
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,700
The world is big.

540
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,700
The country is holy.

541
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
The people are important.

542
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
He asked me to live

543
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,700
because he is a good man.

544
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,700
He didn't see the world.

545
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,700
A poor and pitiful man.

546
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,700
How can he be his half?

547
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,700
Is he really that kind of person?

548
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
You will know.

549
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,700
I am a man.

550
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
I am a man.

551
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,700
I am a man.

552
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,700
I am a man.

553
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
I am a man.

554
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,700
I am a man.

555
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,700
I am a man.

556
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,700
I am a man.

557
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,700
I am a man.

558
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,700
I am a man.

559
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
I am a man.

560
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
I am a man.

561
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
I am a man.

562
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,700
I am a man.

563
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,700
I am a man.

564
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,700
I am a man.

565
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,700
I am a man.

566
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
I am a man.

567
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,700
This is not the voice of helpfulness.

568
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
We have both been Statistics for a long time.

569
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
This is not the voice of helpfulness.

570
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Is it fundamentally?

571
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,700
This is how much news we can do tomorrow.

572
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,700
This is our head脱 data.

573
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,700
It is not a visual study.

574
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,700
ο χ Gasmos.

575
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,700
This is my head phone record.

576
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,700
I will never be here again.

577
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,220
I was wrong at this moment.

578
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,100
I am willing to be punished.

579
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,620
Prime Minister, don't blame yourself.

580
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,900
Prime Minister has done a good job.

581
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,060
I was not able to hold it back.

582
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,060
I was wronged.

583
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,500
Princess.

584
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,060
I need to raise Prime Minister

585
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,380
as soon as I can.

586
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,820
I, Li Zhongnan,

587
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,500
will guard the palace

588
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,220
and take the crown prince's position.

589
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,220
Prime Minister, please rise.

590
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,020
Thank you, Princess.

591
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,860
I have a secret letter.

592
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,300
Please give it to the crown prince.

593
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,060
Call Shen Xun.

594
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,900
Shen Xun has been kneeling for a night.

595
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,060
It's your turn now.

596
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,540
1400 yuan, the amount will be me

597
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,500
in the first half of this season.

598
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,020
Does Shen Yirong

599
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,900
treat me like an idiot?

600
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,300
You are very noble

601
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,260
but do this for the sake of saving your life.

602
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,940
I will never lose

603
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,260
alone.

604
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,040
But if he cribs up while I stay with him

605
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,580
I will risk my life

606
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,580
to avenge that makes me a dead man.

607
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,460
But

608
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,500
he is on my side.

609
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,860
But it looks like someone

610
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,780
is going to die.

611
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,780
I want him to die easily.

612
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,780
He doesn't need to hurt you.

613
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,780
Just like what happened today.

614
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,780
I warned you not to interfere.

615
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,780
But you didn't believe me.

616
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,780
You pretended to be busy.

617
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,780
You hurt yourself.

618
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,780
What do you think I should do?

619
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,780
There are many enemies in the gun.

620
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,780
Your Highness,

621
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,780
kill them.

622
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,780
You want to kill them?

623
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,780
For you,

624
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,780
I can kill anyone.

625
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,780
You are so heartbroken.

626
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,780
Unfortunately, I can't love you anymore.

627
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,780
The King of the City

628
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,780
Shuxun,

629
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,780
His Majesty said he would investigate it.

630
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,780
How could he let Li Zhongnan go?

631
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,780
I am sure.

632
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,780
I am not a coward.

633
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
What do you mean?

634
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,780
Lu Ji,

635
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,780
tell me.

636
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,780
Even the King of the City

637
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,780
who has never been punished by the King of the City

638
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,780
will be punished.

639
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,780
Li Zhongnan will be punished this time.

640
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,780
He will be punished this time.

641
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,780
If you don't show your sword,

642
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,780
you will be punished.

643
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,780
I killed Li Zhongnan's Wei Qian and Zhang Kun.

644
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,780
I couldn't fight Li Zhongnan for a short time.

645
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,780
I can't fight him anymore.

646
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
I guess

647
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,780
Wanning still has a white sword.

648
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
What should I do next?

649
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
Wenjing,

650
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,780
tell me.

651
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,780
I...

652
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,780
What is this?

653
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,780
Think about it.

654
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,780
Or you will fall in love with the King of the City.

655
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,780
My Lord,

656
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
you are so kind.

657
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,780
You love the King of the City.

658
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,780
My Lord,

659
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,780
think about it.

660
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
Think about it.

661
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,780
I will think about it.

662
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,780
I will think about it.

663
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
I will think about it.

664
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,780
Something is wrong.

665
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,780
I asked what should I do.

666
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,780
I will think about it.

667
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,780
I didn't do anything.

668
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
It's unfair.

669
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,780
My Lord,

670
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,780
why are you so stubborn?

671
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,780
I will think about it.

672
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,780
I will think about it.

673
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,780
I will think about it.

674
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,780
I will think about it.

675
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,780
I will think about it.

676
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,780
I will think about it.

677
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,780
I will think about it.

678
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,780
I will think about it.

679
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,780
I will think about it.

680
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,780
I will think about it.

681
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,780
I will think about it.

682
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,780
I will think about it.

683
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,780
I will think about it.

684
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,780
I will think about it.

685
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,780
I will think about it.

686
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,780
I will think about it.

687
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,780
I will think about it.

688
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,780
I will think about it.

689
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,780
I will think about it.

690
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,780
I will think about it.

691
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
I will think about it.

692
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,780
I will think about it.

693
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,780
I will think about it.

694
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,780
I will think about it.

695
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,780
Tentacle!

696
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,780
Thank you.

697
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,780
Thanks for your kindness!

698
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,780
Thank you!

699
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,780
I should thank you for your kindness!

700
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
You are now an Evil King.

701
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,780
I'm qualified.

702
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,740
I can't bear it.

703
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,060
It's almost the time to save the Eighth Night.

704
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,620
When we enter the Central Plains,

705
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,460
we will listen to whatever you want.

706
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,820
We will want women.

707
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,740
We will want women.

708
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:50,340
Go! Go! Go!

709
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,860
Your Highness,ailing maids will be closed.

710
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,780
I think she is a bit capable.

711
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,800
Can't believe what could have happened.

712
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,720
There has been a coldер in Beijing.

713
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,820
Now the temperature is gone.

714
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,900
L advertisement volume is as high as a year.

715
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,340
It'll're hard for us to severe from let go.

716
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,300
Your Highness.

717
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,460
I'm sorry to have bothered you as such.

718
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,660
If we continue like this, we'll be in trouble.

719
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,180
As long as there's a war,

720
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,020
I'm not afraid that the emperor's brother won't be able to defend himself.

721
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,060
But the Dai State hasn't been in any action recently.

722
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,500
If there's no action, then make some action.

723
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,260
If we want to create a fake image of the Dai State,

724
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,820
then Da Yan will immediately use the power of the Beijing State

725
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,660
to strike it out.

726
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,140
I'll go to the border to create chaos.

727
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,740
I'll help the King of Cheng to make a big deal out of it.

728
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,940
Son, why are you always so concerned about yourself?

729
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,140
What did the Princess of the Royal Palace say to you?

730
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,740
Brother Jiu Shuai, you scared us to death.

731
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,140
The Princess of the Royal Palace didn't blame you for it, right?

732
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,940
Back then, you shouldn't have gone to the Palace to bully the Princess of the Royal Palace.

733
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,140
If you don't care about the Princess of the Royal Palace, then forget it.

734
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,940
You have to care about our mother and daughter.

735
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,740
I'm an old widow. It doesn't matter.

736
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,940
I'm sorry that your sister is still not married yet.

737
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,140
I'm also hoping that the Princess of the Royal Palace

738
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,940
will find a good wife for our Shen Family.

739
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,740
Get out!

740
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,740
Forget it, Mother.

741
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,140
Brother Jiu Shuai is probably tired today.

742
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,940
Let's not bother him anymore.

743
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,340
Brother Jiu Shuai is in his heart.

744
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,740
I'm not leaving yet.

745
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,540
I once doubtfully figured out what I did

746
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,440
for a proper person.

747
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,440
Why did you pull me back from hell?

748
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,960
I used to think that

749
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,040
it's because of hatred.

750
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,760
It's because of the lack of people.

751
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,720
It's because of the heartless and impertinent.

752
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,280
A poor and poor man

753
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,000
with a potential.

754
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,960
How can he become his half-man?

755
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,680
The Fengbo of Jiang's family

756
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,160
is finally over.

757
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,080
I can finally rest assured.

758
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,160
Look at the girl.

759
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,520
Who does she look like?

760
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,640
Of course, she looks like our master.

761
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,320
As a woman,

762
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,360
she can have

763
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,640
such a grudge against the people.

764
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,840
Let me tell you.

765
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
She looks like an old man.

766
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,360
The blood of the Jiang family

767
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,640
is left on her body.

768
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,000
Of course, she is the ancestor of the Jiang family.

769
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,600
She is a very old woman.

770
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,240
We have been watching her for many years.

771
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,560
I'm really sorry for her.

772
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,920
I will not break her

773
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,680
if you are wise.

774
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,240
You can't say that.

775
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,840
She is a brother.

776
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,640
But she is still a child.

777
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,320
She has been out for so many years.

778
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,200
She is not like the cold and warm at home.

779
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,680
When she comes back,

780
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,160
she will really rely on her.

781
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,880
You can tell her

782
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,360
to prepare a reception banquet for the second girl.

783
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,200
Yes.

784
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,080
Madam,

785
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,600
I heard that the old madam

786
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,040
didn't blame Jiang Yu.

787
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,200
But she is going to help her to prepare a reception banquet.

788
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
Now Jiang Li is in a good mood.

789
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
She is in the face of the Jiang family.

790
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,240
The old madam will definitely be in her mind.

791
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,240
It's hard to expect that Jiang Li will do something.

792
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,960
She has entered the prison of the Dali Temple.

793
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,040
Why are you helping her again?

794
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,200
You have to get her out.

795
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,640
She is in a good mood under the government.

796
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
She is very smart.

797
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,560
She knows that the Jiang family

798
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,160
is a good family at this moment.

799
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,920
Even if I have to save her,

800
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,600
we can't move her in the future.

801
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,920
Jin Dai, sit.

802
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,560
I am willing to help her.

803
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,120
The husband and the old madam

804
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,640
are not going to be a reception banquet for the sake of the Jiang family.

805
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,720
Jiang Li has a good heart.

806
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,880
She wants them to go to her.

807
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,760
Only when they are sitting down

808
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,600
will they know that they are in pain.

809
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,720
As for us,

810
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,720
as long as it is appropriate,

811
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,280
we should remind the old madam

812
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,840
to see where she is in Jiang Li's mind.

813
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
That's enough.

814
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,440
I understand what you are thinking.

815
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,760
I heard that

816
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,600
the county magistrate of Xingshu and the people of Huai Xiang

817
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,440
are all in the Ye family.

818
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,000
Isn't that so?

819
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,240
I heard that the Ye family is the root of the family.

820
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
They also have to be entrusted to Jiang Li

821
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,240
and the people of Huai Xiang to celebrate the celebration.

822
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
That's great.

823
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,560
They are going to celebrate the celebration?

824
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
That's great.

825
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,720
We have been looking for days.

826
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,240
The reception banquet that the old madam wants

827
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,840
is to be held with them on the same day.

828
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,440
Let's see if Jiang Li is willing to leave the people of Huai Xiang

829
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,960
or to light the house with the husband and the old madam.

830
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
I understand.

831
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,440
The old madam recommends the new professorcussion of Imperial Concubine.

832
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,040
Three of them died in不知道.

833
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,160
According to the current all kinds of them

834
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
and the rest of them are来得及一 garlic,

835
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,160
אני pillar and too much salt.

836
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,760
But even Herb greater benevolence

837
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,040
who Elle Lingya resumes hers

838
00:40:50,040 --> 00:41:00,640
will definitely find good medicine for the

839
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,520
He Ye family.

840
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,480
a bustling person,

841
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,400
you and I dazu public the possibility that

842
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,600
someone can hold off evil intentions

843
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,560
byaculared with your own intention and ability

844
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,660
According to my opinion,

845
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,120
you said the dog was화

846
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,360
who was bashed in vård

847
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,760
and Silked in Leaving

848
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,720
the unrecognisable cause

849
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,580
which hadn't been met

850
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,940
since he walked forward

851
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,160
for a long time

852
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,560
and injured my heart

853
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,420
What is the solution?

854
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,320
In the heart,

855
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,000
sealed in soul begins to move

856
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,920
music tomorrow

857
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,120
ή

858
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,040
Within past five years,

859
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,320
she became a key target of 15 people.

860
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,120
She's already sent 50 people into the Palace of Excuses,

861
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,640
designed one selection list

862
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,000
for every single person.

863
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,120
Lengcock,

864
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,160
say yes.

865
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,080
Hello.

866
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,360
I started to want

867
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,720
the assistance I could give

868
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,600
after being turned into contracts

869
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,280
with trainedера.

870
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,360
Make it a deal.

871
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,360
I can't cure it.

872
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,360
I can't cure it better than the doctor.

873
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,360
No matter how much money I spend,

874
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,360
I will cure Xue Xianling.

875
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,360
This is the favor I owe Xue family.

876
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,360
I shouldn't have come back.

877
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,360
You've helped me a lot on this journey.

878
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,360
Jiang Li, remember.

879
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,360
The Ye family will be your backup.

880
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,360
I... will do as you say.

881
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,360
I remember.

882
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,360
What's wrong with her now?

883
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,360
Last time, the chief said that he would let me

884
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,360
waste my life on useless things.

885
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,360
So, what is she doing now?

886
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,360
I don't know.

887
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
She's 30 years old.

888
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,360
She's eating at the celebration banquet in the Ye family.

889
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,360
She said she would thank the people who came to pay the bill.

890
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
Thank the Ye family?

891
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,360
Yes.

892
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,360
I'm sorry.

893
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,360
I'm sorry.

894
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,360
I'm sorry.

895
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,360
Ye family?

896
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
Yes.

897
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,360
It's the Ye family,

898
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,360
the young and talented Ye family.

899
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,360
Go and call her over.

900
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
No.

901
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,360
She's already happy.

902
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,360
If you can't call her over,

903
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,360
you can go to the 30th Prince yourself.

904
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,360
I...

905
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,360
I'm done eating.

906
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,360
No need to play.

907
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,360
Go and drink with her.

908
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,360
Go on.

909
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,360
Thank you.

910
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,360
Let's wish the school to be a good student.

911
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,360
Let's drink.

912
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,360
Let's drink.

913
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,360
One, two, three.

914
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,360
Cheers.

915
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,360
Cheers.

916
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,360
I wonder what you plan to do when you go back?

917
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,360
I plan to go back to Huai Xiang for a while.

918
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
If I have a new teacher,

919
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,360
I'll go back to Huai Xiang and continue doing things for Huai Xiang.

920
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,360
Yes.

921
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,360
We don't need to ask for anything.

922
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,360
We just want to be in the hometown and be safe.

923
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
And go back to the old office.

924
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,360
My dear,

925
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,360
I'm just like your uncle Liu.

926
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,360
I'll only have a good life in the future.

927
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,360
Li,

928
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,360
I'm going back.

929
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,360
Why are you going back?

930
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,360
Your mom's most regretful thing is that

931
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,360
as a daughter,

932
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,360
she can't walk freely in this world like a man.

933
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,360
You're quite angry now.

934
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,360
I'm relieved.

935
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,360
I still have time to take care of you.

936
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,360
I'll go to your mom's place

937
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,360
and take a good look at this world.

938
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,360
But don't worry.

939
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,360
Uncle Liu is always your uncle.

940
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,360
Ye Jia is always your family.

941
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,360
I'll always be your Ma Qianzu.

942
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,360
Second Miss Jiang,

943
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,360
and me.

944
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,360
Second Miss Jiang,

945
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,360
don't forget me.

946
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,360
Miss Jiang, as long as you say it,

947
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
we brothers will not be in the same boat.

948
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,360
That's right.

949
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,360
And me.

950
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,360
Yes, and me.

951
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,360
The kind of affection you all have.

952
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,360
I'm so grateful

953
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,360
that you all willing to bet your life

954
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,360
for the love between Xue Qingling and Fan An.

955
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,360
The mountains and seas are free to return to each other.

956
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,360
The wind and rain are free to meet.

957
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,360
I will do this for you.

958
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,360
I only wish

959
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,360
that we can meet again in the future.

960
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,360
Great.

961
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,360
We can meet again in the future.

962
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,360
We can meet again.

963
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,360
We can meet again.

964
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,360
We can meet again.

965
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,360
We can meet again.

966
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,360
Come on.

967
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Sit down.

968
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
Come on.

969
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,360
Pour the wine over me.

970
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,360
Come on.

971
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,360
Come on.

972
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,360
I'll go in.

973
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
Come on.

974
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,360
Second Miss Jiang,

975
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,360
come here.

976
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,360
Lang Jun.

977
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,360
Yes.

978
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,360
Someone in Jiang family wants to see Second Miss Jiang.

979
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,360
I'll go out and have a look.

980
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,360
Come on.

981
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,360
Come on.

982
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,360
Second Miss Jiang,

983
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,360
you're eating this.

984
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,360
You forgot about the family.

985
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,360
Madam has arranged a family dinner for you

986
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,360
and is waiting for you to get married.

987
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,360
When did you tell me?

988
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,360
I told Xue Qingling this afternoon.

989
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,360
Xue Qingling didn't tell Second Miss Jiang.

990
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,360
I know I'm not at home today.

991
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,360
Does my mother-in-law ask a maid

992
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,360
to tell me the rumors?

993
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,360
Isn't that a matter of no use?

994
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,360
Who told her to run away

995
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,360
from home all day?

996
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,360
There's a feast at home.

997
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,360
She didn't tell me to help her.

998
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,360
What time is it?

999
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,360
She was looking for me.

1000
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,360
Is she not taking me as her family?

1001
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,360
Or does she know

1002
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,360
I'm sending someone to the hometown today

1003
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,360
and arranging it today?

1004
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,360
Second Miss Jiang,

1005
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,360
you're so greedy.

1006
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,360
You're going to be heartbroken.

1007
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
She's breaking up

1008
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,360
to help you prepare the feast.

1009
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,360
It's already a happy day.

1010
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,360
I'm telling you, it's a bit late.

1011
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,360
If I leave now,

1012
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,360
others will think that

1013
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,360
the family doesn't know the rules

1014
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,360
and break their father's face.

1015
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,360
Since that's the case,

1016
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,360
I'll report to Madam

1017
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,360
and give Second Miss another feast.

1018
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,360
Thank you, Mother Sun.

1019
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,360
I'm sorry.

1020
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,360
I'm sorry.

1021
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,360
I'm sorry.

00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,360
I'm sorry.

00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,360
I'm sorry.

1024
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,360
I'm sorry.

1025
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,360
I'm sorry.

1026
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,360
I'm sorry.

1027
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,360
I'm sorry.

1028
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,360
I'm sorry.

1029
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,360
I'm sorry.

1030
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,360
I'm sorry.

1031
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,360
I'm sorry.

1032
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,360
I'm sorry.

1033
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,360
I'm sorry.

1034
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,360
I'm sorry.

1035
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,360
I'm sorry.

1036
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,360
I'm sorry.

1037
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,360
I'm sorry.

1038
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,360
I'm sorry.

1039
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,360
I'm sorry.

1040
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,360
I'm sorry.

1041
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,360
I'm sorry.

1042
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,360
I'm sorry.

1043
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,360
I'm sorry.

1044
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,360
I'm sorry.

1045
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,360
I'm sorry.

1046
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,360
I'm sorry.

1047
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,360
I'm sorry.

1048
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,360
I'm sorry.

1049
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,360
I'm sorry.

1050
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,360
I'm sorry.

1051
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,360
I'm sorry.

1052
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,360
I'm sorry.

1053
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,360
I'm sorry.

1054

I'm sorry.

1055
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,360
I'm sorry.

1056
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,360
I'm sorry.

1057
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,360
I'm sorry.

1058
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,360
I'm sorry.

1059
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,360
I'm sorry.

1060
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,360
I'm sorry.

1061
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,360
I'm sorry.

1062
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,360

1063
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,360
