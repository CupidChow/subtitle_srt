1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm lost in the world

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my plans

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's just a page of a book written in your heart

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A fox in my heart

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Accept all the gifts of love

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't want to lose even if I regret it

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Slowly resist the suffering of the world

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I walk through the winter and winter, I still miss it

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Waiting for the spring to return

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You are really a young official in white

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't like you talking to me like this

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not comfortable

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Kneel down

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Your Highness

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Kneel down

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Kneel down

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You are really magical

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Even Xia Kui's posture looks better than other men

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thanks to the crown prince

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't like official and civil officials

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't like white clothes

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I like to see you looking at me

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Unbearable

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Shen Lang

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's have a party

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your Highness's new plan is unprecedented

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's about the state affairs of the state

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's hard to follow

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's rare to see your attitude so firm

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't worry

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Get up and eat

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The trial will be held on the tenth of next month

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I will write down the specific assessment rules in the memorial

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I am very relieved to hand the trial to Shen Qing

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Your Majesty, the eldest princess wants to see you

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Your Majesty

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The scholar Shen is also here

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Did I disturb you to talk about official affairs?

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I dare not

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I have reported it

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I will leave first

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Scholar Shen

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I have an idea today

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I also want to ask your opinion

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I heard that the trial of this year is coming

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
In previous years, the horizontal and vertical were all tested

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There was no good talent

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I have a good idea this year

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What good idea?

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What do you think of the men and women in the team?

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Nonsense

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The imperial examination of the Imperial College is different from the imperial examination of the Imperial College

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How can men and women take the exam together?

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Your Majesty, do you think the nobles in the capital

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Will the nobles be able to take the back legs of the young men and women?

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I am not

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Your Majesty

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Don't forget

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was the first to change the Yan to the An Di

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You sit in the throne today

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Isn't it me?

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So don't underestimate the ability of this girl's family

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
At the critical moment

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Not as good as men

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Your Majesty should give them a chance to compete together

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What do you think of my idea?

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Ok

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I will follow your idea

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you, your Majesty

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Shen Lang

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I can only enter the palace for you today

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So next time, don't be willful

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I will teach you what is obedience

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The Imperial College

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Be gentle

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Like this?

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Good writing

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Jiang Li

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Jiang Li

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have something interesting to tell you

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Something interesting?

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This year, Mingyi Hall and the Imperial College will take the test together

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The men and women team will take the exam together

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is unprecedented

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
How can there be such a strange exam?

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What do you know?

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This time, the new year's resolution is granted by His Majesty

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And the new head of the department, Shen Yurong, is already in your place

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And I heard that His Majesty will personally summon

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The nobles in this year's year

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You said this is a rare opportunity

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Which girl should I go to the team?

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Me

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You?

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Jiang Li

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You should go to Mingyi Hall first

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But I also advise you not to have such absurd ideas

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Mingyi Hall is the place for the female officials who have both good looks and good looks

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
To study

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Your good looks are not so good

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But this good look is unique to you

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
As for good looks

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You are still far from it

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Even if Uncle left

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And put you in Mingyi Hall

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You will be eliminated by then

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Isn't that the biggest joke in the capital?

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You can't help but laugh

111
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But you can't help but be hungry

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why are you so afraid of boiling water?

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Uncle will definitely not let you go

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I bet with you

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If you go

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I and Ding Liangzhu

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Will do the same thing

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We will climb the national sword

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you know how to do it?

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If you are capable, show us

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
How can you not fight with a woman?

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Why hasn't Bingji come here these days?

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I heard from Madam that Bingji has been cold these days

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
When he is well in the room

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He will look at Madam again

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He is showing me his face with a child

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Madam, Madam is asking for an audience

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Come in

131
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Grandmother

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why are you here all of a sudden?

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I came to thank you

134
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Bai Xue is kind and kind

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And he is very skilled

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's rare

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
If he gives you, he is your maid

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You should teach him well

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Grandmother

140
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I have one more request

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Sit

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Tell me, what's wrong?

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I have been in Zhennv Hall for ten years

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I am very famous

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Now my father has taken me back

146
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The Jiang family has also been very respectful to me

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But in the eyes of outsiders

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I am still a woman with mistakes

149
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Second girl

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You are too thoughtful

151
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Grandmother

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I want to go to Mingyi Hall to study

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
First is to cultivate

154
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Second is

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I also want to make a name for myself

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's a good thing for a woman to study

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Grandmother thinks so too

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No matter what kind of person our second girl is

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We should let the outsiders see it

161
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Grandmother

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Look

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This is the writing I wrote

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Good writing

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Zhennv Hall is not a place to study and write

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You must have practiced very hard

167
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's not hard to get a grandmother's praise

168
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Come

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Your father's handwriting is also good

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Just be a Prime Minister

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Write a few words

172
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
In the hands of others

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It became a treasure

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He is also unwilling to write

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You take this writing

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Take it to your father

177
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He is happy

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
By then

179
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let him let you go to school

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You go to school

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Grandmother will give you the four treasures of the literature

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I dare not

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You are afraid

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Someone is unhappy, right?

185
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Don't worry too much

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This note is put on me

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Grandmother will talk to your father about this

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Thank you grandmother

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Drink a bowl of pear soup

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Good

191
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is the writing written by Li

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What do you think?

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There is a proportion in the formula

194
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Is there a difference in the quality?

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It seems that you also think it is good

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Then you look at this word

197
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Can you knock on the door of Mingyi Hall?

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Li Er

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
To enter Mingyi Hall

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What do you think?

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This

202
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Li Er is so enthusiastic

203
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I am also very happy

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's just that Mingyi Hall

205
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Not as good as the private school outside

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Every year there are women

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Because of poor grades

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And were evicted

209
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Li Er didn't read much before

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm worried that after going there

211
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Will someone embarrass her?

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yan Bai is the current chancellor

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
His children

214
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Can't be a white nail

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Smile

216
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Li Er has been in Zhenyu Hall for so many years

217
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Can still learn such a good word

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's a lot of work

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Where are you afraid of others?

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
In my opinion

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This writing

222
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's better than seeing you grow up

223
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What the old lady said is right

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's just that Li Er can enter Mingyi Hall

225
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Not as good as you and me

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Husband

227
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I think it's better to send a teacher

228
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
To test Li Er's knowledge

229
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So that everyone has a bottom

230
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Good for the Jiang family and Li Er

231
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There are some reasons

232
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Then let Yuan Ping

233
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Go to the teacher who taught Jiang Jingrui

234
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
He is old

235
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And has a sharp eye

236
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I said that year

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Jingrui can rely on the recommendation to enter the Imperial College

238
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Then he will enter

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yes

240
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll go to Yuan Ping later

241
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Wait, husband

242
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How can Mingyi Hall be the same as Guo Zijian?

243
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Then who do you think should be chosen?

244
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I have a candidate

245
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If he thinks that Jiang Li

246
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Can pass the selection of Mingyi Hall

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Then others will not criticize the Jiang family

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And the whole school

249
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Teacher Shen

251
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Minister Jiang

252
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Let's talk

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Teacher Shen hosts two small events

254
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Come to run away from the prison every day

255
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Now you can have some free time

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Thank you for your concern

257
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's free to take a break today

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's great

259
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I have a request

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
My second girl wants to study at Mingyi Hall

261
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But you also know

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
She has never been to a serious school

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Jiang Xiang is like Guo Qianjin

264
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Not vulgar

265
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You are right

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Try her knowledge for me

267
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So that her mother and I can rest assured

268
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
will갑 you nothing but laughter.

269
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,200
Don't say it again

270
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:48,080
or be�utiful to the好好好

271
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,160
Teacher Shen,

272
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,400
Do you have any individual difficulties?

273
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Madam Jiang.

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Master Shen, please sit.

275
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Have some tea first.

276
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll have someone bring Li'er here.

277
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Master Shen, please sit.

278
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Master Shen, Li'er has been raised in Zhennv Hall for ten years.

279
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If there is anything that is wrong, please forgive us.

280
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Madam, you're too kind.

281
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Master Shen.

282
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm not respectful.

283
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Madam, you don't have to be so polite.

284
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll take the money as you took it.

285
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Please remember to do your work well.

286
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Li'er is my legitimate daughter after all.

287
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It shouldn't be a problem to enter a small Mingyi Hall.

288
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Please don't disappoint me, Master Shen.

289
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I thought you gave her money for...

290
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Why are you saying nice things for her?

291
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Do you know why I asked Master Shen to come to Jiangning?

292
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I really don't know.

293
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Master Shen is from Hanmen.

294
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He was a high-ranking general.

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He wanted to set up a banquet to get the power of the capital.

296
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But no one came to the banquet.

297
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He set up an empty banquet.

298
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So he hated those high-ranking officials.

299
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
He was a master who couldn't buy money.

300
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I asked him to come to let him see through Jiangning.

301
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Master Shen.

302
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Master Shen.

303
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You've lost your power.

304
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You are the only one I attach coming to Jiangning.

305
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You're no longer the hero Shilate Boxping.

306
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,440
Post or

307
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes.

308
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm a friend thatalion Express knows.

309
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:10,700
by a

310
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,280
I did.

311
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,600
Who did you go with?

312
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,280
She's dead.

313
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,080
Don't listen to her anymore.

314
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,480
Shen Xue is afraid of thunder?

315
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The private matter

316
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,200
is not something we should talk about.

317
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Mrs. Jiang,

318
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,000
please be careful.

319
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,480
The night of Mount Qingcheng,

320
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,800
the coldness of the bones,

321
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,200
coldness can make people see everything.

322
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,320
I didn't understand

323
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,000
why my beloved family

324
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,000
would be so cruel.

325
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,600
I was sent to Mount Qingcheng

326
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
for ten years.

327
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,600
But now I understand.

328
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
I saw the mark left by my mother.

329
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,600
I knew it was a misunderstanding.

330
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,600
My mother still cared about me.

331
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,400
So I went to the mountain

332
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,600
to find her.

333
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,800
But my mother still cared about me.

334
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,800
So I have a love affair.

335
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,200
For ten years,

336
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,200
I lived alone.

337
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,800
Now I only want to depend on myself.

338
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
So I hope Shen Xue

339
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
won't be too selfish.

340
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
trolls

341
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,000
What about

342
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,600
you, Shen Xue?

343
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,800
Any news?

344
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,200
Can I see your Ly jul?

345
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,880
I think

346
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,000
you are talented.

347
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,840
But if you want to be a good actress,

348
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,160
you should be more careful.

349
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,160
Since I'm talented,

350
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,680
why should I be a good actress?

351
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,840
Why don't you dare to look at me?

352
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,160
I'll tell you the truth.

353
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,640
It's getting late.

354
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,920
Goodbye.

355
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,280
Does Shen Xue Shi hate me?

356
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,680
Or I've offended Shen Xue Shi?

357
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,440
Why are you so quiet?

358
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,320
Why are you so mean to me?

359
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,240
Did you do it?

360
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,720
Why are you so mean to me?

361
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,560
Why?

362
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,280
You...

363
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,800
People say that Shen Xue Shi

364
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,760
is a good actress.

365
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,800
He's a good actor for the Crown Prince of Han.

366
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,680
You're a good actor.

367
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
You're a good person.

368
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,200
Now I just want

369
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,960
a chance to study.

370
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,720
You know I'm better than others.

371
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,360
I deserve to be in the Hall of Fame.

372
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,680
But you

373
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,440
are trying to kill me.

374
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,080
I was wrong about you.

375
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,920
Or people were wrong about you.

376
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,840
Do you really feel ashamed?

377
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,320
Do I feel ashamed?

378
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,000
Are you done?

379
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,720
I'll deal with you later.

380
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,760
Be careful.

381
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,680
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

382
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,800
I'm fine.

383
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,880
Shen Xue Shi.

384
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,640
Do you think

385
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
will be more appropriate.

386
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,760
If so,

387
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,360
I'll listen to you.

388
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,120
I'll leave first.

389
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,840
Okay.

390
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,680
I'll see you out.

391
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
The End

392
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,920
Why are you reading

393
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,400
the books of Ruyin's entrance exam?

394
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,200
Ruyin can't study.

395
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,000
I can teach him.

396
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,680
Do you want to go to the hall?

397
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,120
If I haven't left the hall,

398
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,560
I must go to the hall to have a look.

399
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Take care, Mr. Shen.

400
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,760
I admire you

401
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,640
for your good looks.

402
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,600
I'm glad to hear that.

403
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,120
I'm from a poor family.

404
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,440
I've seen so many

405
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,400
fake books

406
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,040
and real villains.

407
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,680
But the position of the second lady

408
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
is hard to get.

409
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,120
It's hard to get her.

410
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,760
Although the door of Mingyi Hall

411
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,960
is not easy to get,

412
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,720
it's hard to get

413
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,720
with one year's worth of position.

414
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
The End

415
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,280
I heard from Mr. Shen

416
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,680
that it would be better

417
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,280
to send Jiang Yi to Mingyi Hall next year.

418
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,640
Why did you change your mind?

419
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,440
Maybe something was wrong

420
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,760
when you sent Mr. Shen out.

421
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,440
Anyway,

422
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,480
the master asked someone

423
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,800
to help Jiang Li pack up.

424
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,400
Mother.

425
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
Mother.

426
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Did you hear that?

427
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,640
Jiang Li is going to Mingyi Hall to study.

428
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,600
Go back to practice.

429
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,240
Mother.

430
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,080
Why don't you stop him?

431
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,120
Do you think I will

432
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,280
be with him in Mingyi Hall

433
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,240
to be together?

434
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,680
You're yelling at me

435
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,840
for such a small thing.

436
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,400
I've taught you to be steady since you were a child.

437
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,480
You're feeding the dog.

438
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,800
Or do you think

439
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,920
your noble background

440
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,040
and your high-level playing

441
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,040
will be inferior to a country girl?

442
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,160
I...

443
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,360
Go back to practice.

444
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,080
Any news from the scout?

445
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,280
No news at the moment.

446
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,840
Ding Jinxian.

447
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,080
Once Yang Song died,

448
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,880
he couldn't get the money

449
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,080
from the Salt and Iron Division.

450
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,720
But he still has to do

451
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,840
the business of Li Zhongnan.

452
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,640
If he makes a move,

453
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,440
there will be a problem.

454
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,560
Yes.

455
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,000
By the way, Master.

456
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,040
I heard that the two Sui Shops

457
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
are going to make a big move this year.

458
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,080
What do you mean?

459
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,120
Princess Wanning met the Emperor

460
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,000
and proposed that the Imperial College of the Imperial Family

461
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,080
should hold a joint exam with Mingyi Hall.

462
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,840
The two students will take the same exam.

463
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,800
The Emperor has agreed.

464
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,360
Is Shen Yunrong still the main examiner of Sui Shops?

465
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,040
Yes.

466
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,320
The new plan of the Princess Royal

467
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,920
is undoubtedly to open the door

468
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,040
for those students to join the party.

469
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,000
Shen Yunrong

470
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,320
has never been a high-ranking person.

471
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,240
He hates to join the party and private life.

472
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,240
It looks

473
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,240
interesting.

474
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,640
It's not only interesting.

475
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,760
Shen Yunrong even helped Jiang Li

476
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,680
enter Mingyi Hall.

477
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,640
It's a good show.

478
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,560
I have to watch it.

479
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,280
Right.

480
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,600
Let's go.

481
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,960
Why do you turn in water

482
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Why are my beloved family

483
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
so cruel?

484
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
Do you really hate me?

485
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,960
Why are you so mean to me?

486
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Why?

487
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Brother,

488
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
come out for dinner.

489
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Brother.

490
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
Brother.

491
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
Brother.

492
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
Why didn't you answer

493
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
and lock yourself in there?

494
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Come out for dinner, brother.

495
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Where are you going

496
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
in such a heavy rain?

497
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,960
Brother.

498
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
I knew it.

499
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
As you expected,

500
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
my wife's tomb

501
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
was really turned over last night.

502
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
She is always suspicious.

503
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
I think she can rest assured for a while.

504
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Thanks to your kindness.

505
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Brother.

506
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Brother.

507
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
Brother.

508
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Brother.

509
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
Brother.

510
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Brother.

511
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
Brother.

512
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Brother.

513
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
Brother.

514
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Brother.

515
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Brother.

516
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
Brother.

517
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Brother.

518
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Change her my clothes.

519
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Our lady is dead.

520
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Why should she be in your clothes?

521
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,960
Change them first.

522
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,960
I will explain it to you in the future.

523
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
I'm sorry for Jiang Li.

524
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,960
She was even pardoned after she passed away.

525
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
Sister.

526
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,960
My wife will definitely bless us when she's down there.

527
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
She won't blame you.

528
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Then this is considered a pass.

529
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
It's getting late.

530
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
I'm going to the school.

531
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Sister.

532
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Sister.

533
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Can I go with you?

534
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
I'm worried about you.

535
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,960
When did you see a maid in the school?

536
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,960
But since we left the school and went home,

537
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
I've never left you.

538
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,960
We can take care of each other when we have something to do.

539
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
You're going to the school alone now.

540
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
I'm worried...

541
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
When did you see me suffer?

542
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
But you...

543
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Sister.

544
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
You're alone at home.

545
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
You have to be careful and protect yourself.

546
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
The piano is broken.

547
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
I'll change it and bring it over.

548
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
How about we go in together?

549
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,960
No need.

550
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
You two go ahead.

551
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
I'll ask my mother for another car.

552
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,960
I'm sorry that I can't go to the school with you.

553
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Then...

554
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
See you in the Hall of Fame.

555
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
Okay.

556
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Sister.

557
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Ji's gone out early in the morning.

558
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Who are we sending for now?

559
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Jiang Li.

560
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Aren't you going to the Hall of Fame?

561
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Yes.

562
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
I'm about to go.

563
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Where's the sister's carriage?

564
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
They've left.

565
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
It's okay. I'll go.

566
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,960
I'm a kind person.

567
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
I don't want to be bullied.

568
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
Jiang Li.

569
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Get in my car.

570
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Go.

571
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
Go.

572
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Pack everything and eat.

573
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Okay.

574
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Don't call it Yin-zuo-de-hu.

575
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
Why do you have to ride a car like theirs?

576
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
It's very tiring.

577
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
They always take the same car to the school.

578
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
It's not that.

579
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Sometimes the professional gang

580
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,960
will pick up Jiang Rong Yao.

581
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,960
Are you going to the Hall of Fame

582
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
to see Zhou Yan Bang?

583
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,960
What else?

584
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
It's so comfortable at home.

585
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Why do you have to live there?

586
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
You must be there to see Zhou Yan Bang.

587
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
I told you

588
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
he's engaged.

589
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
It's not worth it.

590
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
I heard that

591
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
His Majesty will personally summon

592
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
the winner of the Hall of Fame.

593
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
His Majesty will also give a reward.

594
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
I want this reward.

595
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
You want to enter the palace?

596
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
You want a reward?

597
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
What do you think the Hall of Fame is?

598
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
You just want to win the first place.

599
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
This year's exam is a team of four people.

600
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
The team will be ranked.

601
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
No one is willing to be in your team

602
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
in this group.

603
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
The most likely to win the first place

604
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
is the team with the two young masters

605
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,960
of the Prime Minister Li.

606
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
The eldest son Li Jin

607
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
has been stable

608
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
in the school of the first three.

609
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
He is usually particularly low-key.

610
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
Although the second son Li Lin

611
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
is not as good as his brother,

612
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
he is particularly capable

613
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
of handling things

614
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
and those capable people.

615
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
The son of the Li family

616
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
is the first person in the Hall of Fame.

617
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,960
He is the son of the court officials

618
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
who have the power.

619
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
It's a pity that

620
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Li Zhongnan and our uncle

621
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
are in the court.

622
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
We can't be in their team.

623
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
In fact, if we can be in the same team

624
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
with the Jiang family,

625
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
that's great.

626
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,960
Jiang Ruoyao

627
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
has been the leader of the Jiang family since childhood.

628
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
His brotherhood

629
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
is the first person in the Hall of Fame.

630
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
But these two sisters

631
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
are good at writing.

632
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
They are good at dancing.

633
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
But there is a good marriage agreement in the God Realm.

634
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Zhou Yanbang

635
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,960
is very good at riding.

636
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,960
Even if he is compared with the son of the Li family,

637
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,960
the son of the Li family

638
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,960
may not be as good as Zhou Yanbang.

639
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,960
The God Realm

640
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
Did you see that?

641
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
Jiang Ruoyao and Mr. Zhou

642
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
are the second person in the Hall of Fame.

643
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,960
They are from the Shi family.

644
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
They have a marriage agreement.

645
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
So they can't be together.

646
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
Yes.

647
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
They can't be separated.

648
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Even if you squeeze your head,

649
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
you can't get in.

650
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
Is there a third floor?

651
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Is there a third floor?

652
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Who is so unobtrusive?

653
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
You...

654
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
You are Xue...

655
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
Why did you come to the Hall of Fame?

656
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,960
Are you crazy?

657
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
You can come to the Hall of Fame.

658
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
Why can't the second lady of the Jiang family come?

659
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Yes.

660
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
It's the second lady of the Jiang family

661
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
who killed her mother and brother.

662
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
Who are you talking about?

663
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
I tell you.

664
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
Who is talking about this in the future?

665
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Don't blame me for being rude.

666
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Did you see that?

667
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Shen Ruyun

668
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
is the third person in the Hall of Fame.

669
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,960
One of the family members got it.

670
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
They followed the dog and the sky

671
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
and entered the Hall of Fame.

672
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
The Shi family didn't take them to play at all.

673
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,960
So they can only group up themselves.

674
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,960
But it's too late for you to join them now.

675
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Is there a fourth floor?

676
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Yes.

677
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
It's us.

678
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,960
We are ready to lay the cover.

679
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Ready to go at any time.

680
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,960
The late emperor founded a female school.

681
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,960
He put up a ground floor in the Imperial College.

682
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,960
The building of the Xiu family is named the Hall of Fame.

683
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,960
It's also known as the Shi Dali and Ming Dali.

684
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
The emperor inherited the wisdom of the late emperor

685
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,960
and valued female students.

686
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,960
So he expanded the rules of the Hall of Fame.

687
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Now, the male and female students

688
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,960
are not together except for class.

689
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,960
Our courtyard is all for the same purpose.

690
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
You hit me?

691
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,960
Don't hit me.

692
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
Don't bully me.

693
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Don't run.

694
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,960
You are so strong.

695
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Stop him.

696
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Who is that?

697
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Your cousin?

698
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
Do you remember?

699
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
My cousin?

700
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
Your mother.

701
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,960
The relative of the Ye family.

702
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
Your cousin Ye Shijie.

703
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
She just came from Luyang this year.

704
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
She is rich and famous.

705
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
She is the local rich.

706
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,960
But she is too lonely.

707
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,960
She only knows to read and not to interact with others.

708
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
She is not right.

709
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
How is her grades?

710
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,960
Her grades are top.

711
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
I thought I didn't find her.

712
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
But I am so embarrassed.

713
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
I am so embarrassed.

714
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
Look at my dad.

715
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
Sister, you are here.

716
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,960
Sister.

717
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,960
She is the Jiang Li who came back from Zhennv hall.

718
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Zhennv hall had a storm and a fire.

719
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,960
She is like a wood fire in that kind of place.

720
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,960
She won't be at ease.

721
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Maybe she came to the school for Mr.Zhou.

722
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
This is my second sister's first time to come to school.

723
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,960
I am sorry for you.

724
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,960
If there is anything wrong, I will apologize to you.

725
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,960
Second sister, you are late.

726
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
I left you a seat.

727
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,960
But I am so embarrassed to stand up for you because of the crowd.

728
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
Third sister, you don't need to care about her.

729
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,960
She is older than us.

730
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,960
She will find a seat.

731
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,960
Yes.

732
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,960
I won't bother you to arrange it.

733
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,960
The bell is ringing.

734
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
You are Jiang Li?

735
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
Yes.

736
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
Jiang Li, nice to meet you.

737
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,960
Sit down.

738
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
Next is the碎誓.

739
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,960
I hope you can see me again after the opening.

740
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
Start the class.

741
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Sleep.

742
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,960
I want to proceed to retry application assignment tomorrow.

743
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:13,060
Don't bother with the

744
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,440
business with Mr.Zhou

745
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,960
OK, fine.

746
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Bye bye.

747
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
See you tomorrow.

748
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,960
With your explode.

749
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
Okay

750
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
Look at this.

751
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,960
I prepared two gifts for you.

752
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,960
Do you want to see the left one first or the right one?

753
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,960
The right one.

754
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,960
This is the cake I bought for you.

755
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,960
Your favorite cake.

756
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,960
Thank you.

757
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,960
Isn't that Jiang Li?

758
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,960
Why don't I go and ask her to come over and let you see it?

759
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,960
I'm just curious.

760
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,960
Why did Jiang Li suddenly come to the Hall of Famous People?

761
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,960
She's not as talented as you.

762
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,960
Okay.

763
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,960
You haven't seen the gift I bought for you yet.

764
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,960
I made a hairpin for you.

765
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
Put it on.

766
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,960
You are the most beautiful third wife of Jiang.

767
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
You are so beautiful.

768
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
You are so beautiful.

769
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,960
Look.

770
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,960
That is the second wife of the Commander-in-Chief.

771
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,960
Do you think she is much prettier than Jiang Ruoyang?

772
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,960
I heard that she was the first one to get engaged with Zhou Yanbang.

773
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,960
Do you think she will get back what she did

774
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
after she stole the fiancee of her sister?

775
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,960
The second wife Jiang's reputation is so poor.

776
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
After she was rejected by the Duke of Ningyuan,

777
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,960
she has no family to come to the Hall of Famous People.

778
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,960
I can help her.

779
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,960
I can help her.

780
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,960
Let's go.

781
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,960
The second wife Jiang,

782
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,960
enjoy your tea later.

783
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,960
What are you doing?

784
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,960
A group of men

785
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,960
are not a female student in the daytime.

786
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,960
It's shameless.

787
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,960
You are not good at women.

788
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,960
How dare you talk to a man?

789
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,960
No one in the whole capital will marry you.

790
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,960
If I am good at women,

791
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,960
I would rather be a woman than a man like you.

792
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,960
What did you say?

793
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,960
You...

794
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,960
What did you say?

795
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,960
Forget it.

796
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
Don't mind her.

797
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,960
The son-in-law of the Hall of Famous People is so rude.

798
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,960
Let's go.

799
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,960
We will go.

800
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,960
You...

801
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,960
Let's go.

802
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,960
Forget it.

803
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,960
Let's go.

804
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,960
Let's go.

805
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,960
You are so bad.

806
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,960
Let's go.

807
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,960
I want to see.

808
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,960
I don't want to see.

809
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,960
Thank you.

810
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,960
I am not here to help you.

811
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,960
I just don't like to be blocked.

812
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,960
I know you.

813
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,960
I know you.

814
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,960
You used my mother in Zhen Nv Hall.

815
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,960
The elders love you.

816
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,960
But I don't like you.

817
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,960
You are so ungrateful.

818
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,960
I heard that the lady of Liu's family is a good talker.

819
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,960
I really have seen it today.

820
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,960
I am honest.

821
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,960
Of course I am not a coward like you.

822
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,960
Chu Xun.

823
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,960
There is news from Manhong House.

824
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,960
A guest claims to be Mr. Ji Mo.

825
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,960
He is Mr. Ji Mo.

826
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,960
He has been a rich man.

827
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,960
He was drunk when he went there.

828
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,960
He said he couldn't come here often.

829
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,960
He is so annoying.

830
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,960
He must have lost his money.

831
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,960
He is so shameless.

832
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,960
Where is Mr. Ji Mo from?

833
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,960
He is from the former Tang.

834
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,960
He came to the capital two years ago.

835
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,960
Former Tang?

836
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,960
The lady of Kongpan Guan is also from the former Tang?

837
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:36,960
Duke Su.

838
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,960
I am sorry.

839
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,960
The room you often sit on the second floor.

840
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
There is someone here today.

841
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
I will arrange another place.

842
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,960
You open the shop on the first day.

843
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,960
Don't you know Duke Su likes to sit there?

844
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,960
I have no choice.

845
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,960
It is Mr. Li.

846
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,960
He insists on sitting there.

847
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
I want to change a place for him.

848
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,960
He doesn't want to change.

849
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,960
Mr. Li.

850
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,960
It is rare to meet you.

851
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,960
Put the tablecloth on me.

852
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,960
Duke Su.

853
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,960
Mr. Li said that

854
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,960
he would not disturb you.

855
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,960
Look.

856
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,960
This...

857
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,960
Mr. Li.

858
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,960
You are in a good mood.

859
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,960
Duke Su.

860
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,960
What can I do for you?

861
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,960
Not every time.

862
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,960
Today.

863
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,960
Let's have a cup of tea.

864
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,960
The scenery here is good.

865
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,960
But.

866
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,960
I have already occupied it.

867
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
If Duke Su wants to drink tea.

868
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,960
Change another place.

869
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,960
Today, the tea is free.

870
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,960
I will treat you.

871
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,960
It is okay.

872
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,960
Normally.

873
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,960
I don't like to be in a hurry.

874
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,960
Today.

875
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,960
I am in a good mood.

876
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,960
Sit with you.

877
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,960
Mr. Li.

878
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,960
What are you looking at?

879
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,960
I am looking at you.

880
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,960
I am looking at you.

881
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,960
I am looking at you.

882
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,960
I am looking at you.

883
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,960
I am looking at you.

884
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,960
I am looking at you.

885
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,960
I am looking at you.

886
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,960
I am looking at you.

887
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,960
I am looking at you.

888
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,960
I am looking at you.

889
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,960
I am looking at you.

890
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,960
I am looking at you.

891
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,960
I am looking at you.

892
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,960
I am looking at you.

893
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,960
I am looking at you.

894
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,960
I am looking at you.

895
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,960
I am looking at you.

896
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,960
I am looking at you.

897
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,960
I am looking at you.

898
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,960
I am looking at you.

899
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,960
I am looking at you.

900
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,960
I am looking at you.

901
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,960
I am looking at you.

902
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,960
I am looking at you.

903
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,960
I am looking at you.

904
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
I am looking at you.

905
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,960
I am looking at you.

906
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,960
If there is no happy memory

907
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,960
How can I cross the sad bottom

908
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,960
Two cold and heartless people

909
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,960
Holding hands

910
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,960
Can we cross the snowy mountains

911
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,960
In the cold wind

912
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,960
In the long night

913
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:13,960
Hugging the remaining warmth

914
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,960
The sea is deep

915
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,960
Uncertain

916
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,960
Can we cross the snowy mountains

917
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,960
Can we cross the sigh of yesterday

918
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,960
Love is to cherish with life

919
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,960
Live on

920
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,960
Even if it's a little hurt

921
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,960
No matter sadness or joy

922
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,960
I believe you

923
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,960
I'd rather be trapped in the coldness of the world

924
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,960
Live on

925
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,960
Spend all your courage

926
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,960
Love on

927
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,960
Love on until you breathe

928
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,960
Cross the valley of half life

929
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,960
Just to meet you

930
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:49,940
After the
