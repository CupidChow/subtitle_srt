1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly hold the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've walked through the cold winter and I still feel lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Waiting for the spring to return

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Your Highness

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is the letter sent by the Central Secretary

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Give him the letter of the new employee

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Tell him

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't think I forgive him

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The Central Secretary said

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This letter is about Mrs. Jiang

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Bring it here

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Sister

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You are so pretty

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's me, sister

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You don't know me?

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll give you the next flower

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So beautiful

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sister

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Who is he?

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Father

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You come to see me, father

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You come to see me

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I... I'll give you a flower

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
On the tea

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Jiang Xiangguo

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What do you mean?

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You gave him a morning

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You want to take away the clothes he wore

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This new house is much better than the Jia Miao

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And the flower grass he likes

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He is patient and gives her a maid

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He will definitely be here

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No worries, no worries, no care

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Sister

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You are so fierce

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Li is here today

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He wants to talk to the empress

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Li

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Li

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Drink tea

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Is it to threaten me today?

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You misunderstood

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This is a good thing

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
After all, the things mother did before

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Her Highness already knows

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Now she can enjoy this kind of life

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It depends on your face

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Sister

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You have no idea

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What you are thinking

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
On your face

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Then why are you looking for me?

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I heard that

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
From the wedding, Li and Shen Yurong

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Are your ideas

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's the love you said

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I just

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Remember it

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Your Highness can do everything for me

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Li is grateful

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Li is just worried

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Your Highness will be like mother

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Be treated as a horse's foot

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are you talking about?

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
When I first met Ruo Yao

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I was the one who helped her

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Since then

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Ruo Yao never listened to mother's words

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Mother thought I was the one who was in charge

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So she made a killing move on me

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This was discovered by the princess

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
After I went back to the prison

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Princess wanted to kill me

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Mother's killing

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Finally made princess find a chance to kill someone

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But I can only fight back

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
For the sake of my life

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Things will turn into what they are now

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You are so clean

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It doesn't matter if I'm clean

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The important thing is

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Princess is looking after you

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
As far as I know

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The wedding between me and Shen Yurong

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is not your idea

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You are also a person

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You are also a person

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You...

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You know nothing

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I know

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You are like me in the past

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You are bloodied by princess

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If you don't solve the problem

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
She will only be broken

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You can think about it

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If you are willing to

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Work with me

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can help you solve your problem

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I can live in this courtyard

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You and I are two families

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
How about that?

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Your Highness

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I am not sorry

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I finally know

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Why those who want to kill Jiang Li

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Are all dead

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Jiang Xiangguo

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You are so simple

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Your Highness is not here

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sister

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Jiang Xiangguo

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I am the most important person

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
In this world

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We sister and I

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We have been together for a long time

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And we have been together until today

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I think you and I

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Are very close

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I am very close to Jiang family

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can't afford to

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Be the one who is going to kill my sister

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Although I am wrong

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Jiang Li

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Must pay the price

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The marriage

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Is not a choice

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It depends on your later sister

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I will not be involved in your family

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I hope Jiang Xiangguo will understand

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The principle of being a good wife and a good husband

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
As a parent

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Wait for the child's daughter

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Do not abandon the child

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
To protect your own principle

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's not a good time

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

162
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

165
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

167
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
know that she is different

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,440
I am the one who is going to kill my sister

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,800
Your highness

181
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,000
Jiang Yuanbaai Feels叔然

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I Tiped a new House

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,040
I Tiped a new House

184
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,000
I Tiped a new House

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But Concubine just did not waver

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But Concubine just did not waver

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But Concubine just did not waver

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,900
But Concubine just did not waver

189
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,360
She was ofня had a curry

190
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,720
I only ask Consort Li to take her own life.

191
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,240
Consort Li is still a stable person.

192
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,440
She has many dreams.

193
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
She can't take it anymore.

194
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,600
But I want to go to His Majesty to see my son.

195
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,960
How do I feel that you're in a hurry to get married?

196
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,760
I want you to get married as soon as possible.

197
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Shen Lang,

198
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,320
your love is not for Consort Xue.

199
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,760
She can't give me a hand.

200
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,400
Her love is really good.

201
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,360
You played one last time.

202
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,960
Why don't you play one more time in front of Consort Li and me?

203
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Why?

204
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,280
Then, you can let Consort Li

205
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,160
get married in front of His Majesty?

206
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,960
There are many ways to get married as soon as possible.

207
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,640
I just want to see

208
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,480
how the two people who are in love with each other

209
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,680
are so bright and bright.

210
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,080
Don't you feel sad?

211
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,560
Is that what you want to ask?

212
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,880
If His Highness wants to see, I'll give it to him.

213
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
The wine you gave me personally

214
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
didn't open up.

215
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Your Majesty.

216
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Why did you come to the Imperial Library to see me?

217
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Did anything happen?

218
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
I heard that you've been writing for a day.

219
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,280
I brought the desserts here.

220
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
You've been taking care of me.

221
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
It's your birthday in a few days.

222
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Have you thought of any gifts?

223
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

224
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,280
I don't have any gifts.

225
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,280
I just keep thinking about the past.

226
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,280
I was so cold-hearted that I couldn't attend the banquet.

227
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,280
I heard that the day that the second wife and Shen Xue were together,

228
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Wanru was so sweet.

229
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,280
It's a pity that I didn't see them again.

230
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
What's so hard about that?

231
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Minister Su.

232
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
I'm here.

233
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Go and tell the imperial court that Li Fei was born that day.

234
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Please train with the second wife and Shen Xue.

235
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Yes.

236
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
I still want to ask someone.

237
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Okay.

238
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Wanning lost her eyes in the house during that time.

239
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Why don't you teach her a lesson?

240
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Okay. I have my reason.

241
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Li!

242
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Li! Are you okay?

243
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
I'm fine.

244
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Don't pretend to be us.

245
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,280
We know what Consort Li has done to you.

246
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Why did you turn the tables when you were so busy?

247
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
You're so stupid.

248
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,280
If there's no reason to be so stupid, can Li turn the tables?

249
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,280
I'm a little bit anxious now.

250
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,280
I'm thinking of a way to do it.

251
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Ye Shijie is here too.

252
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
I'm chatting with the general.

253
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
What are you chatting about?

254
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Of course, it's your wedding.

255
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Li!

256
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,280
Master, look at me.

257
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,280
I found so many people hiding in the house.

258
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Master,

259
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
there's a situation in the Jiang family.

260
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Li Fei invited Jiang Li and Shen Yurong to his birthday party.

261
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,280
He's afraid that he'll be fired.

262
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
When?

263
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Two days later.

264
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,280
The crown prince said that he invited Ye Shijie to his wedding party.

265
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,280
He's a good man at this time.

266
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
What?

267
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
To find him?

268
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Yes.

269
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Don't worry, Uncle Jiang.

270
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,280
I'll help you with this.

271
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Okay.

272
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
I'll take my leave then.

273
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Li is here too.

274
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Li, we're talking about you.

275
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
What's my problem?

276
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Shijie, you tell me.

277
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,280
We all know about Shen Yurong's request for a marriage.

278
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
I know you're not willing to marry him.

279
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,280
So I'll go to His Majesty and tell him that we have a marriage.

280
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
His Majesty has always been a great man.

281
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,280
He'll definitely take back the order of the marriage.

282
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
This is a miracle.

283
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,280
I've agreed to this with Ye family.

284
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
We're not afraid.

285
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Uncle Jiang was also a hero.

286
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
I can trust Shijie.

287
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,280
This is the best chance to get married.

288
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
No need.

289
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Don't worry.

290
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
This is just a chance to help you.

291
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,280
If you don't want to marry him,

292
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,280
we'll have a marriage.

293
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Marriage is important.

294
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,280
Besides, I'm a woman.

295
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
I don't want to be in your shoes.

296
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,280
You're the one who made me feel sorry for you.

297
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
I'm sorry.

298
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,280
I'm sorry.

299
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,280
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
I'm sorry.

302
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,280
But I don't want to.

303
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
It's a very urgent matter.

304
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,280
I just got a message from the palace.

305
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,280
He wants to serve you as His Majesty's wife.

306
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,280
That's why I came to the world.

307
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,280
You can think about it again.

308
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
I'll come anytime.

309
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Madam Jiang.

310
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Our Lord is waiting for you outside the door.

311
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Duke Su is here.

312
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Why didn't you come in?

313
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
It's about Madam Jiang.

314
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Please come outside and talk to her.

315
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
What's the point?

316
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Father.

317
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
I'll go out first.

318
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Where are we going?

319
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
To the palace.

320
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
Why are we going to the palace?

321
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Please serve me as your wife.

322
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
Duke Su.

323
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
When is the time?

324
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,280
Let's not joke around.

325
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
What's this?

326
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,280
The confession of the palace maid, like Consort Xian.

327
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
So soon, you found her?

328
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Those people under my control

329
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,280
are not like the wine and food bags in Wanning's hands.

330
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Where is the palace maid now?

331
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
I've hidden her secret.

332
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
I've arranged for her to be the maid.

333
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,280
So I haven't cleaned up the room yet.

334
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
So we're going to the palace to see Consort Xian now?

335
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
You're going to see Consort Xian.

336
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
I'm going to see His Majesty.

337
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
What do you want to see His Majesty?

338
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
What?

339
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
I want this wedding.

340
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
You can come to the palace anytime.

341
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Who brought you in?

342
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
It doesn't matter.

343
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,280
This is what you should be concerned about.

344
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Where did you get it?

345
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,280
I said before that it would help you solve your problem.

346
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,280
You should be happy with me now.

347
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,280
I've underestimated you again and again.

348
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Who are you?

349
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,280
What you should be concerned about is not this.

350
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
What do you want?

351
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,280
I'm different from Wanning.

352
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
I won't threaten you with this.

353
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
I just beg you.

354
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
I won't be punished by Wanning.

355
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,280
I won't be the maid of the palace when I'm not involved in the wedding.

356
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Even if I don't mention it,

357
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,280
do you think Wanning will be ashamed of herself?

358
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,280
You and Shen Xueshi were pushed to the prison.

359
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,280
Even if I don't have the help,

360
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Wanning will also be punished by the water.

361
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,280
I've been planning this for a long time.

362
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,280
Now there's only one step left.

363
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I need Your Highness to help me with Your Highness's birthday banquet.

364
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,280
What is there to do?

365
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Xiao He, don't be too much.

366
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
I'm too much.

367
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,280
When Shen Yirong asked for the wedding, why didn't His Majesty say so?

368
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
It's just a wedding. What are you looking for?

369
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,280
His Majesty knew that I was a woman of Jiang'er.

370
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
This is my fault.

371
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
They were making fun of the court.

372
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
I don't want to make things difficult for the two families.

373
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,280
This is the best way.

374
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Is His Majesty determined?

375
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Xiao He, I'm sure you'll take back your heart.

376
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
I'll take my leave.

377
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
What were you doing?

378
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Why are you looking so tired?

379
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Nothing.

380
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
I just had a fight.

381
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,280
You're the first person to fight with His Majesty.

382
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
You look relaxed.

383
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Did you talk about the city?

384
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
Li Feitong helped me.

385
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
What did he help you with?

386
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
I won't tell you.

387
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Even if you press on Li Fei,

388
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
how will you get married

389
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,280
if you open your mouth and ask for your leave?

390
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Even if you get married,

391
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,280
at least one month is needed for the wedding banquet.

392
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,280
I have a way to make them cancel the engagement in one month.

393
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
That won't do.

394
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
It's a deal.

395
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
It's not a deal either.

396
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Do you think you can't serve me anymore?

397
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,280
I've been with you for a long time.

398
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,280
I feel so uneasy today.

399
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,280
I'm not happy to see you.

400
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,280
I'll leave first.

401
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Your Highness, Duke Su wants to see you.

402
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Xi Ke?

403
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Did you say that he was the old woman

404
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,280
who borrowed the snow from the imperial concubine?

405
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Yes.

406
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
You can keep it a secret.

407
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Duke Su, you're so carefree.

408
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Why are you here today?

409
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,280
Is it because of Shen Yurong's father?

410
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Don't you feel sorry for him?

411
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,280
I can get whatever I want back anytime.

412
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,280
Your Highness, you're not a mortal.

413
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
I'm not a mortal.

414
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,280
I'm just a man.

415
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
I'm just a man.

416
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,280
I'm just a man.

417
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,280
I'm just a man.

418
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Your Highness, you're not a mortal.

419
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
I'm always petty.

420
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,280
I don't want to be a man.

421
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
You're a man.

422
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,280
How can I cancel the wedding of Jiang Li?

423
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Duke Su is so kind.

424
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,280
I've done a lot for Jiang Li.

425
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
How can I compensate you?

426
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,280
I won't give you the money.

427
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,280
I want a lot of things.

428
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
You can't afford it.

429
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Is this enough?

430
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
What a coincidence.

431
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Lady Jiang is here.

432
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,280
It's Consort Li's back.

433
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Lady Jiang is really lucky.

434
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,280
I'm a little bit envious.

435
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,280
I'm just a little bit envious.

436
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,280
I'm just a little bit envious.

437
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,280
I'm just a little bit envious.

438
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,280
I'm just a little bit envious.

439
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
The emperor is here.

440
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,280
Consort Li is here.

441
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,280
Your Majesty, welcome Consort Li.

442
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
Please come in.

443
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Thank you.

444
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Consort Li is pregnant today.

445
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
She doesn't want to be a man.

446
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
So I invited you here.

447
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Consort Li has been thinking about

448
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,280
the relationship between Shen Qing and Lady Jiang.

449
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
I wonder if you two

450
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,280
can meet again today.

451
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,280
I'm honored to meet you.

452
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,280
I'm willing to marry you.

453
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,280
I'm willing to marry you.

454
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Okay.

455
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,280
I invited Wan Ning here today.

456
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,280
She was in a daze before.

457
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,280
I told her to come here.

458
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,280
I hope you two can meet again.

459
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
Your Majesty, you're smiling.

460
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,280
I won't be with them.

461
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
That's good.

462
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Let's have some food first.

463
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,280
We'll start the music later.

464
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Please come in.

465
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Lady Jiang from Shen Xue City.

466
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Please wait here.

467
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Look at my eyes.

468
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,280
Other than the dance,

469
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,280
it's a little bit like loving your family.

470
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
I didn't know

471
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,280
what I knew.

472
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,280
What kind of knowledge

473
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,280
should I have?

474
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Do you know that if you insist on fighting with Lady Jiang,

475
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,280
there will be no good result?

476
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
Then you still want to marry me?

477
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Do you want to use me

478
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
to get your Princess Jiang out of here?

479
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
You still don't believe me.

480
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,280
I once believed you.

481
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,280
What's the result?

482
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
A man like Xiao Heng

483
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
is worthy of your trust.

484
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,280
If I have a background like him,

485
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
I'll do it.

486
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Do you believe

487
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,280
I can change you with Lord Long Wu?

488
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,280
Is this enough?

489
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,280
Is this Lord Long Wu's clothes?

490
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
Since you know him,

491
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,280
you don't need to explain it to me.

492
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,280
You call this thing

493
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,280
and you'll be the first one to know.

494
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,280
If you give this to me,

495
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
the world will be in chaos.

496
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,280
I don't care who is the first one to know.

497
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
I only want him.

498
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
So you don't know.

499
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,280
Then I'll tell you.

500
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,280
You can be at ease.

501
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
From tomorrow on,

502
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,280
no one will mention the marriage again.

503
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Even if His Majesty is the re-dealing,

504
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
I will also reject it.

505
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,280
That's Lord Long Wu's clothes.

506
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,280
I'm curious.

507
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
If His Majesty knows

508
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,280
that Xiao Heng will be handed over

509
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,280
to Lord Long Wu

510
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
for a woman,

511
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
will he be exiled

512
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
or be saved?

513
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Your Majesty,

514
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
the interrogation is ready

515
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
for Lady Jia.

516
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Let's start.

517
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Your Majesty.

518
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Your Majesty.

519
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Your Majesty.

520
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,280
Your Majesty.

521
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Your Majesty.

522
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Your Majesty.

523
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,280
Your Majesty,

524
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
if Xiao Heng is handed over

525
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,280
to Lord Long Wu

526
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,280
for a woman,

527
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,280
will he be exiled

528
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,280
or be saved?

529
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:21,840
CK,CK,CK,CK,개�ety!

530
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,400
Doctors often concede

531
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,860
to make such meal with proper care for his baby.

532
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,640
But Times Times

533
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:45,760
had attendedífic

534
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,820
Clothes and doctor knew

535
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,740
Good thing.

536
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,780
Do you think

537
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,340
I and Consort Li

538
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,500
deserve to play the song for you?

539
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,180
Forget it.

540
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,940
Before, the two of you

541
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,980
were rehearsing every day

542
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,180
in the Shenxue City.

543
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,820
You were acting.

544
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,940
Now,

545
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,260
I'm in a hurry.

546
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,060
I have to watch you perform.

547
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,340
No matter what,

548
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,140
today

549
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,260
I've forgiven

550
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,940
the regret I didn't have

551
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,340
to go to the banquet.

552
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,420
Come on.

553
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,780
Let's drink.

554
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,460
Princess, you're

555
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,100
rarely in the palace.

556
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,620
This cup of red wine

557
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,260
is specially prepared for you.

558
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,180
Try it.

559
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,540
It's not your taste.

560
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,660
Shenxue City,

561
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,180
you've seen

562
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,100
Lady Jiang'er

563
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,220
playing the song

564
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,540
on the Mingyi Hall.

565
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,180
Tell me.

566
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,300
Is her performance today

567
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,180
the same as before?

568
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,660
I know her well.

569
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,380
I now know that

570
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,100
she's completed

571
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,820
her performance.

572
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,300
Does she

573
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,740
know

574
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,300
that Lady Jiang'er

575
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,980
played the baby?

576
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,500
No, she didn't.

577
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,180
She's only cooked

578
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,060
rice dishes

579
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,380
after a long time.

580
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,180
This song

581
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,620
is in your region.

582
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,980
Tell me.

583
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,620
I was thinking

584
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,980
that Xue Xie Ling's son, Xue Zhao,

585
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,380
who saved Huai Xiang,

586
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,660
was found.

587
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,780
I think

588
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,180
it's still the miracle that Princess Royal gave me.

589
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,740
Princess Royal always said

590
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,100
I was Consort Xue.

591
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,700
She said that she didn't die.

592
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,820
I suddenly had a thought.

593
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,580
I was wondering if Xue Xie Ling's son

594
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,980
would die.

595
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,100
So,

596
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,740
I asked Duke Su to help me find him.

597
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,940
Before today,

598
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,460
Duke Su told me

599
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,700
that he found him.

600
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:57,940
I think

601
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,300
when Xue Zhao wakes up and asks him,

602
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,140
he can help Shen Xue

603
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,700
find the person who killed his father-in-law

604
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,140
and his brother-in-law.

605
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,420
Okay.

606
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
Since that's the case,

607
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,140
I'll leave it to Duke Su.

608
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,140
If it's useful to the case,

609
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,660
I'll give you a hand.

610
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

611
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,500
But it's the end of the world.

612
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,620
I, Yue He Shen Xue,

613
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,940
will play a song called

614
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,460
Huai Xiang Xiao Qu.

615
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,780
It's not a song that I've played.

616
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,380
It's not a good song.

617
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,420
Huai Xiang Xiao Qu,

618
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,180
Shen Xue, you should be familiar with it.

619
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,580
If you really forget it after a long time,

620
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,820
why don't you listen to it?

621
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,500
It sounds good.

622
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,820
The song on the ground

623
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,820
should be more popular

624
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,980
and more popular.

625
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,460
Then let's start.

626
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,500
Yes.

627
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,860
My啊花淀

628
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,260
Huai Xiang Xiao Diao.

629
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,620
Madam's becoming a good woman.

630
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,620
I remember the moment we met.

631
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,620
Do you still remember?

632
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,620
How can I forget?

633
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,620
Episode 1

634
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,620
Are you giving the Dragon King to the princess for me?

635
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,620
You know it.

636
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,620
Is this your way?

637
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,620
Yes.

638
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,620
Didn't anyone mention the wedding today?

639
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,620
How important is the clothes?

640
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,620
Why did you give it out so easily?

641
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Didn't I say that I have a way to solve it?

642
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,620
You ordered that you would find the thing you wanted in September.

643
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,620
You knew it.

644
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,620
Then why did you give it out?

645
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,620
I guessed it.

646
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,620
But I didn't know what you wanted.

647
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,620
You should figure it out.

648
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,620
Take the clothes back.

649
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,620
I've never seen you so absurd.

650
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,620
It's not my business. It's yours.

651
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,620
You mean I'm very important to you?

652
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,620
Xiao Hao.

653
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,620
All right.

654
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,620
In fact, giving the clothes back is just part of our plan.

655
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,620
Us?

656
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,620
Who?

657
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,620
The emperor and I.

658
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,620
What's going on?

659
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,620
There's a king behind you.

660
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,620
The king has been worried about the throne.

661
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,620
The king is not coming back for a day.

662
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,620
The emperor is in a state of peace.

663
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,620
In the past eight years, the king has been working in Beijing for a long time.

664
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,620
He's been very proud of himself.

665
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,620
Now the people in Beijing are not the emperor's people.

666
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,620
And the king is not the king's people.

667
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,620
The king is going to build a throne like this.

668
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,620
He will not be able to make himself a good image that will make the people happy.

669
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,620
He will be able to buy the horse with a decent price.

670
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,620
The king is not afraid of the emperor?

671
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,620
He may be willing to be the emperor.

672
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,620
If the emperor is willing to take the throne,

673
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,620
he will be able to harm the evil people who are in the palace.

674
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,620
The emperor will be the emperor.

675
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,620
In this way, the king will be more successful in the city and the city will be more successful in the city.

676
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,620
In the past eight years, the king has been buying horses in Beijing.

677
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,620
He will be able to buy the horse in the court.

678
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,620
He will be able to make money in the court.

679
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,620
The court has a rational and difficult party.

680
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,620
He will be able to make money for the two of them.

681
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,620
He will be able to make money for the two of them.

682
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,620
These people are like the emperor's people.

683
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,620
The emperor is the thickest person in the State of 통kang.

684
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,620
He is the smartest person in the king.

685
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,620
He doesn't have to be the Goron's son.

686
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,620
Whensama asked him.

687
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,620
He was very understanding of how he was so bogated.

688
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,620
The emperor wants to sell him.

689
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,620
Even the natural capital knows about Him.

690
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,620
He will not sell him in the capital in seven years.

691
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,620
Commander in chief of the army is called the greenfall.

692
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,620
This is a him确,

693
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,620
he has Lu Six.

694
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,620
This is where he brought the court of Dragonism.

695
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,620
This person is called the Yellowleaf Devil.

696
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,620
This person is from Beijing.

697
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,220
until you show up.

698
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,420
Me?

699
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,580
Am I that important?

700
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,180
You've been walking around

701
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,460
and you've made a big deal of the same thing as me.

702
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,740
The guard family was not taken care of

703
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,740
and was taken care of by the private gold mine.

704
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,620
Xue Huaiyuan's case

705
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,060
also gave the emperor a reason to be in the Li Zhongnan's hands.

706
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,700
Originally, because of Shen Yurong,

707
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,660
you had already forced Wan Ning.

708
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,060
But I didn't expect

709
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,140
that the two cards of Xue Zhao and Cihun

710
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,780
in Wan Ning's hands

711
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,020
so I and His Majesty

712
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,620
also made a deal.

713
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,220
Are you crazy?

714
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,340
How dare you ask Lord Longwu's father

715
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,380
to hand it over to the head of the royal family?

716
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,140
The private gold mine is gone.

717
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,740
Li Zhongnan's salt and iron business

718
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,380
has already been killed by us.

719
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,980
Li Zhongnan is gradually losing his mind.

720
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,580
It's hard for him to find a new way of doing it.

721
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,820
How long do you think he will wait?

722
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,740
If he doesn't turn back,

723
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,580
he will only be

724
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,940
trying to take advantage of the state affairs of the imperial court.

725
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,060
If the emperor doesn't give it,

726
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,660
he will even have a reason to turn back.

727
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,740
By then,

728
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,340
the people of the north will die of

729
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,380
the people's greed

730
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,820
and the state treasury of the Yan State

731
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,660
will also be destroyed in this battle.

732
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,980
So...

733
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,060
The Xiayue Taimiao Group

734
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,540
and the King of Chen Wangfeng will return to the capital.

735
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,820
This is his chance.

736
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,340
It's also our chance.

737
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,820
Make it clear.

738
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,740
Hand over Lord Longwu.

739
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,180
He is annoying.

740
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,500
Instead of letting him get up in Beijing,

741
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,820
it's better to let him attack.

742
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,500
Lord Longwu will have

743
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,180
some kind of plan in our hands.

744
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,180
But once he is handed over,

745
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,780
we will be in his hands.

746
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,740
He won't stop this opportunity.

747
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,100
You are not a man.

748
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,220
You are taking me

749
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,940
as your son for revenge and for women?

750
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,700
Your Majesty,

751
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,420
if I am just taking revenge

752
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,820
and making the people of the new world

753
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,300
and the people of the country feel bad,

754
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,260
why should I bear the consequences?

755
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,300
Where is the emperor?

756
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,700
Do you still have a card

757
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,740
to hand over Lord Longwu?

758
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,380
Don't you dare to take my place?

759
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,420
The big move.

760
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,340
The big move is my card.

761
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,660
Can you imagine?

762
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,420
Can you not?

763
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,380
He can't imagine

764
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,100
that handing over Lord Longwu

765
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,540
is just a move to the King of Qin?

766
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,700
That's why I have to pretend

767
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,420
to be taken by the emotions.

768
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,740
Only then

769
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,820
can I take Lord Longwu down.

770
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,420
Do you

771
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,020
have any idea?

772
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,820
I am very clear.

773
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,220
The King of Cheng has tried his best.

774
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,740
No matter what we do,

775
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,860
there are always

776
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,740
two great casualties

777
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,620
in the war.

778
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,100
Your Majesty has been in my hands for eight years.

779
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,780
Please forgive me.

780
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,060
I will use the smallest price

781
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,540
to exchange the biggest victory.

782
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,540
How do I cooperate with you?

783
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,660
Yan Yi, you are out of your mind.

784
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,660
What do you mean?

785
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,060
Xiao Hong,

786
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,260
don't be too much.

787
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:23,900
I am too much.

788
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,820
I am too much.

789
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,340
When Shen Yirong

790
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,540
was married to the King of Qin,

791
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,700
why didn't His Majesty say no?

792
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,020
Why are you in a hurry?

793
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,660
His Majesty knows

794
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,900
I am willing to marry Jiang Erniang.

795
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,180
Why should I be the one to marry him?

796
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,620
They are making a fuss.

797
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,020
The court is in charge of it.

798
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,340
I don't want to make the two families suffer.

799
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,620
This is the best way.

800
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,180
Has His Majesty made up his mind?

801
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,300
Xiao Hong,

802
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,900
take back your heart.

803
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,460
I am leaving.

804
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,100
You are not good at acting.

805
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,140
Fiery stuff!

806
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,820
You must figure out why!

807
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,540
So,

808
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,860
you areено worthwhile to Yu Fu

809
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,780
to Wan Ning.

810
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,780
Why do you use risks?

811
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,040
Life from a small corner

812
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,380
is naturally

813
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,380
rise and move

814
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,380
when it steps foot in.

815
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,680
You should not

816
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,980
go back in for ladders

817
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,700
and unexpected ravenous pimps.

818
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,140
Is there any trick

819
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,500
I can help you with?

820
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
This is the second thing I want to tell you.

821
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,500
I'm going to Dazhao for a few days.

822
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
When are you leaving?

823
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
In a few days.

824
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Before you leave, I'll make a scene to send you off.

825
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,500
You sent someone to watch the Princess' Mansion.

826
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Then I've already given you the bottom line.

827
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,500
What about you?

828
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,500
I'm in front of you.

829
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
There's nothing to hide anymore.

830
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,500
I already know that you like me.

831
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
I like you.

832
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
Do you know that?

833
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Shen Lang.

834
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,500
You said that you hate Xue Feng Fei.

835
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,500
Why am I looking at you in the palace?

836
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,500
You misunderstood.

837
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,500
I was thinking if there was a fraud in the Yu Manor.

838
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,500
After all, Xiao Heng is a coward.

839
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,500
At this moment, I have to hand over the Yu Manor.

840
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Is that the difference between you and Xiao Heng?

841
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,500
You can kill Xue Feng Fei for your life.

842
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,500
But Xiao Heng can die for Xue Feng Fei.

843
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,500
You're far from his love.

844
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,500
You're still telling me about the Yu Manor.

845
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,500
Do you still want to give it back?

846
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,500
Or are you angry with me?

847
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,500
Because the Yu Manor is a good thing for you?

848
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,500
I'm not willing to do anything that you want.

849
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,500
I just don't dare to do anything.

850
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,500
Tell me.

851
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Do you think I'm not sincere enough?

852
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,500
Shen Yu Rong.

853
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,500
You're so heartless to him.

854
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,500
I don't understand what he's up to.

855
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,500
He was trying to kill you in the palace.

856
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,500
Now he's trying to set you up in your house again.

857
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,500
You're so close to him.

858
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,500
Since the day I killed him, I've already become a shameless person.

859
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,500
Your Highness forced me to do this.

860
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,500
Now I regret it.

861
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,500
Why don't you answer my question?

862
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
Are you lying to me all the time?

863
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,500
I never thought of cheating Your Highness.

864
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,500
But I don't know now.

865
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,500
If you say it out loud,

866
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,500
which one is true and which one is false?

867
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,500
I'm tired. I'm sure Your Highness is tired today.

868
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,500
I'll come again.

869
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Shen Yu Rong, are you really willing to do this?

870
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,500
Do you believe I'll send you all to the severed stage?

871
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,500
If you can make Your Highness happy,

872
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
then you can do it.

873
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
I'll do it.

874
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
I'm so worried.

875
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
I'm so worried.

876
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
I'm so worried.

877
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,500
I'm so worried.

878
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,500
I'm so worried.

879
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,500
I'm so worried.

880
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
I'm so worried.

881
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
I'm so worried.

882
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,500
I'm so worried.

883
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,500
I'm so worried.

884
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,500
I'm so worried.

885
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
I'm so worried.

886
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,500
I'm so worried.

887
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,500
I'm so worried.

888
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
I'm so worried.

889
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
I'm so worried.

890
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,500
I'm so worried.

891
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,500
I'm so worried.

892
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
I'm so worried.

893
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,500
I'm so worried.

894
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,500
I'm glad that You're three隻 of me.

895
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,500
I know that I'm busy being whole.

896
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,500
But I show a good side of myself.

897
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,500
It was your ambition.

898
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,500
That's why I still want to be your witness.

899
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,500
You were previously successful.
