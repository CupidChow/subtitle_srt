1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad things

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regret

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And I don't know

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When spring comes, I'll return to my path

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Story of the Phoenix

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Jiang Li, don't blame Uncle San in the future

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're deeply in their hands

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I... I... I had no choice but to do that

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't blame me

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Did you get mad?

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I didn't touch him

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He's the right-winged man who's seduced Xiao Heng

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He can't be a good man now

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I understand

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But the war is over

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You still have to be careful about Xiao Heng

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Is he that dangerous?

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Of course, a common man can't bear to bear it

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He'll be angry

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No matter what happens, he'll be the one to do it

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Do you know Xiao Minghan is dead?

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He'll have to settle the problem

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He'll be in danger if something happens

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't worry

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If Xiao Heng comes, I'll make sure he can't leave the Palace

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's good

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll go back and prepare for the night

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't let me down

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
All the orders are in the palace

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
There's no place to stay except for a few

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The rest are in the important place

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Good, we must keep these three rooms

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No one can let them in

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Even if the imperial guards come, we can't let them in

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We're the last room in the imperial court

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Lord

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I deserve to die

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
My wife was caught

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What's going on?

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I just finished my mission

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The three of us were threatened by the chief

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We followed her and were stopped by the guards

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't know if she's gone

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But she must be in the chief's hands

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll go find a guard

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We can't let them in

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll go alone

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Mingzhi is a scapegoat

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The chief is in danger

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Who's going to be the next one?

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't worry

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I won't miss such a wonderful performance

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You just need to follow the plan

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Protect your health

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The war is over

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How can the chief leave the capital?

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll go save my wife

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What?

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Is Grandpa not like your grandson?

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Be careful

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Your Highness

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is the stew from the kitchen

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He said you need to take care of yourself

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He's finally drunk

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Why didn't he come here?

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The school teacher said he'd come later

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The chief asked me to bring someone

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Open the door

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What's wrong?

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm sorry

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Open the door

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can leave now

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What are you doing here?

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You asked me if I wanted to kill you

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Second time

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Now I'm here to tell you the answer

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You want to save me?

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I want to take you away

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Wanning is really miserable

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
She's wrong to give you

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
She killed me

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What did she do to you?

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You chose all of this

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You're afraid of death

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're afraid of losing your future

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're afraid of losing your mother and sister

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I can understand

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
As long as you tell me

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I won't stay by your side

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But I don't understand

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why did you kill me?

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I was forced to do so

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I was forced by Wanning

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Li

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't be like this

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll go with you

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Really?

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Take me back to your home

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I haven't been there for a long time

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I want to go back and see

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Go

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Li

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Go to sleep

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Just sleep

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Your Highness

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's wrong with you?

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll go to the doctor

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why isn't Shen Yirong here?

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll ask someone to find him

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Go and get me the antidote

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But I'm afraid I can't get rid of it

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I want to find him personally

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Go

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Go

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Where are you going?

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
To save him

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You want to kill me?

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The soup you sent me

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I've already had it

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I want you to be honest

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What do you want to hear from me?

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I used to kill him

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But you chose him in the end

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Am I not good to you?

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
How can you bear to do this?

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
My brother won't spare you

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why not?

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Prince of Cheng's death

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
is a fatal death

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
My sister was killed by the emperor

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and her brother was killed

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The day of the war

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
was a great success

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I even thought about it

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
in the past

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm afraid he has already

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
made up for you

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This is your fate

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can only be

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
a pawn for the rest of my life

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If I don't need it

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll be abandoned by the people

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Shen Yiruo

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Have you ever loved me?

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
A battle for every word

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
you said

164
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
killing to my love

165
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is my gift

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This is the hairpin you gave me.

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll give it to you now.

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll never forget the pain of life.

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I once fell for you.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I can't even touch you.

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Who can?

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I just want to get a new illness.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll give it to you.

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But Shen Yirong,

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
if the people in the world don't believe me,

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll die in the hands of my brothers.

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Then you think that the King of the City will protect you.

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You'll be the one who killed my life.

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If you want to kill me,

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll kill you in the hell.

181
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll never forget the pain of life.

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But I'll die in the hands of my brothers.

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Then you think that the King of the City will protect you.

184
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The King of the City

185
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Don't look at me like that.

186
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I've already avenged you.

187
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You killed me.

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If you want to avenge me,

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
then you...

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You're the one who killed me.

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You're the one who killed me.

192
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Then you're the one who killed me.

193
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I can't die.

194
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm dead.

195
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Who's going to protect you?

196
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't want you to protect me.

197
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You still want to know the truth.

198
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll tell you.

199
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He'll die, too.

200
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What are you talking about?

201
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Look.

202
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What is this?

203
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're the head of the palace.

204
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Tell me what you want.

205
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
After the King of the City takes the soldiers to the city,

206
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
please hand over the fish suit to me.

207
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I want to kill Xiao Heng personally.

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You hate him, too?

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I hate him for being stubborn.

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Bastard.

211
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You should scold him.

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You should scold me.

213
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
When you come here,

214
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
don't scold him anymore.

215
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll wipe myself clean.

216
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't hate me.

217
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll give you everything.

218
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Say it.

219
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'll wipe myself clean.

220
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Your Majesty.

221
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Your Highness.

222
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Consort Li.

223
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Master.

224
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The Palace Bureau has not returned to the capital for this time.

225
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
They've added a new song to my song.

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Please sing it to Your Highness.

227
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I didn't expect you to add a new song to my song.

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You've been working for me for years.

229
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You're so bold.

230
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're really a great model.

231
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I often tell the officials

232
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
to be like the King of Cheng.

233
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Not only can they do a great job,

234
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
but they can also be loyal to the court and the design.

235
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That way, the people can be blessed.

236
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Your Majesty, you're too much.

237
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You're loyal to the Emperor.

238
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
If you're loyal to the people,

239
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
you can serve the people.

240
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll do my best for you.

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'll do my best.

242
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll do my best for you.

243
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'll do my best for you.

244
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Father.

245
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You stay with me outside the palace.

246
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't let them come in.

247
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes.

248
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Qu Zhai.

249
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Qu Zhai.

250
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Qu Zhai.

251
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Qu Zhai.

252
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Qu Zhai.

253
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Qu Zhai.

254
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Qu Zhai.

255
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Qu Zhai.

256
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Qu Zhai.

257
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Qu Zhai.

258
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Qu Zhai.

259
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Qu Zhai.

260
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Qu Zhai.

261
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Qu Zhai.

262
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Ju Zhi?

263
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The guards are the Qing army, Du Zhi, Huishu, Zhang Wei.

264
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
They secretly invade the north and betray the army.

265
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
They are plotting to rebel.

266
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Take them down!

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I wanted to keep you for a few more days.

268
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But you are so anxious.

269
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You came to find me. Take them down.

270
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Ju Zhi,

271
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I knew you were the spy I arranged.

272
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The reason you were eliminated

273
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
was to make you think you were successful.

274
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Zhang Wei, do you know that you are plotting to rebel?

275
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You are not a 15th prince.

276
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You can kill the throne of the King of Cheng.

277
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You are the official of the new royal court.

278
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Take them down!

279
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You!

280
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Zhang Wei!

281
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You!

282
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Stop them!

283
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Send out the signal to the King of Cheng.

284
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Come to me immediately.

285
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Take them all down!

286
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes!

287
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You are so serious about this play.

288
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
She is dead.

289
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Are you crazy?

290
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The princess found out she was poisoned

291
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and misunderstood my intention.

292
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I can't stop myself from doing this.

293
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Then what are you doing?

294
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I am not a spy.

295
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I am a spy.

296
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I am a spy.

297
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I am a spy.

298
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I can't stop and explain.

299
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Then what are you going to do?

300
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The plan is in the dark.

301
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I can't forget the great plan of the King of Cheng.

302
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
After the time is up,

303
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I will personally apologize to her.

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Let's go to the palace.

305
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Princess!

306
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Princess!

307
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Princess!

308
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What do you want to say?

309
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You can't go back.

310
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Wait for me.

311
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Take care of her.

312
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes.

313
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Go.

314
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Who dares to touch her?

315
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
General Xiao Lang.

316
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Go and save Xiao Heng.

317
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I have taken the Yufo from the day before yesterday.

318
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I will kill the people who are going to kill me.

319
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Xiao Heng!

320
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Then I will save you first.

321
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Go back to the mountain and save your blood.

322
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
General Xiao Lang.

323
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
General Xiao Lang.

324
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
General Xiao Lang!

325
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We meet again.

326
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No.

327
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Cousin, you are here.

328
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why are you here alone?

329
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Where is Xiao?

330
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Duke Su went to the imperial court.

331
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I want to talk to you.

332
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Duke Su said that the time has come.

333
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You are here just in time.

334
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
General, you have to take care of her.

335
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Leave the rest to us.

336
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Take her away.

337
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Okay.

338
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I will leave it to you young men.

339
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay.

340
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Go!

341
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
They have already started.

342
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Let His Majesty come out.

343
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I will go to the back to pick up the clothes.

344
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I have drunk too much.

345
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I have to go to the school camp.

346
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Your Majesty, where are you going?

347
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You are not coming back, are you?

348
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It is the good time to go to the imperial court.

349
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Why am I not coming back?

350
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
How about I go with you after listening to this song?

351
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Prince Cheng, I am still here.

352
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Why is His Majesty not coming back?

353
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Prince Cheng, I am still here.

354
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Why is His Majesty not coming back?

355
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Come on, Prince Cheng.

356
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I will toast to Prince Cheng.

357
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Prince Cheng, I will toast to Prince Cheng.

358
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Your Majesty.

359
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Your Majesty.

360
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Your Majesty.

361
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Your Majesty.

362
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Your Majesty.

363
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
No one in the palace has received the seal.

364
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I will send you there.

365
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Aren't you going with me?

366
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Prince Cheng is still inside.

367
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I will wait for him.

368
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Tomorrow, I will see you alive.

369
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

370
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Your Highness.

371
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Your Highness.

372
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Your Highness.

373
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Your Highness.

374
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Princess Zhanggong is killed.

375
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Princess Zhanggong is killed?

376
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What?

377
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
She is not alive.

378
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
She is not alive.

379
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
What is going on?

380
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
What is going on?

381
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The emperor killed her at night.

382
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Princess Zhanggong was killed by the emperor.

383
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
How could His Majesty kill the princess Zhanggong?

384
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
His Majesty is the emperor.

385
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
His Majesty is the emperor.

386
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
His Majesty said that you should be a princess.

387
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You can't let her leave the capital alive.

388
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Just let your own comfort

389
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
catch the princess Zhang as a hostage.

390
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Princess Zhanggong is angry and defrauding her son.

391
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I will kill her.

392
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Then I can bring the princess

393
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
to the capital.

394
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
No.

395
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
His Majesty killed the emperor

396
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and killed the people.

397
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I will die.

398
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Prince Cheng.

399
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Please be a witness.

400
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I can't tolerate the Zhao's night.

401
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I have led the soldiers to the battle.

402
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I only want to avenge the emperor.

403
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But the Zhao's night is a disaster.

404
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I am a fool.

405
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Today,

406
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
he killed my sister.

407
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You are so ridiculous.

408
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Princess Zhanggong is the emperor.

409
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I am sorry for your nonsense.

410
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Please come to the capital to find out the truth.

411
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You knew that

412
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
you would kill the princess, right?

413
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You are a public figure.

414
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Guards.

415
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Take this bitch down.

416
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Zhao Sheng.

417
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You want to break the law?

418
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Let me go.

419
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Let me go.

420
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You are so ridiculous.

421
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Today,

422
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I will take the justice for the emperor.

423
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I will bring the princess

424
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and the dead soldiers to the capital.

425
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
If there is a meaning,

426
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I will tell you now.

427
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
If there is no meaning,

428
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I will kill the emperor

429
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
if there is no meaning.

430
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
What do you mean?

431
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You are a wolf.

432
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You want to be the emperor.

433
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I will follow the king.

434
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Princess Wei Zhang, avenge.

435
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I will follow the king.

436
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I will protect the emperor.

437
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Listen to my command.

438
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
All of you, kill Zhao Yan.

439
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yes.

440
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Everyone, listen to my command.

441
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The emperor is not a man.

442
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Kill the princess.

443
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The king will follow me now.

444
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I will attack you.

445
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
The capital is back.

446
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Shi San, someone is looking for the signal.

447
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Zhang Wei is back.

448
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Take the flag.

449
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Kill him.

450
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Zhao Sheng, we meet again.

451
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Shi Zhi.

452
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You are too brave.

453
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Just use it.

454
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
What a vicious poison.

455
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
After all, the poison of the king

456
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
is my father's.

457
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
My father taught me to use it.

458
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I dare not.

459
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I am so careless.

460
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
This is the sword your father used.

461
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It is a good sword.

462
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I fought with it in the battlefield.

463
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I fought with it in the battlefield.

464
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
He used this sword to teach me martial arts.

465
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
He used it to save me in the battlefield.

466
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I am so suspicious.

467
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
If you are really suspicious,

468
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
how can you frame my father

469
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
eight years ago?

470
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
My father never framed you.

471
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
He is so cruel.

472
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But you framed him.

473
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I think he is a brother of the chief.

474
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
He is the master of the capital.

475
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
If he didn't block me back then,

476
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I would be the one who killed him.

477
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I will kill you tonight

478
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and then kill you ten thousand times

479
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
to avenge my father.

480
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The name of that year

481
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
is you.

482
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I will kill you.

483
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Kill.

484
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Kill.

485
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Kill.

486
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Kill.

487
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Kill.

488
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Who let him in?

489
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
General Long Wu Jun.

490
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Listen to my command.

491
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Open the gate immediately.

492
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Let the Beijing army enter the city.

493
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
What did you say?

494
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Do you want to defy the military order?

495
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I will kill you.

496
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I will kill you.

497
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I will kill you.

498
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I will kill you.

499
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Do you want to defy the military order?

500
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I will go back to the battlefield.

501
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Kill.

502
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
If you listen to my command,

503
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
open the gate.

504
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Let the Beijing army enter the city.

505
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Your Majesty.

506
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
The road ahead is the west gate.

507
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
General Long Wu Jun.

508
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Go.

509
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Go.

510
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
General Long Wu Jun, you can't take care of me.

511
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Why do you want to be a traitor?

512
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,600
Master!

513
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,160
Bastard!

514
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,980
You deserve to die.

00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,020
Disperse through all of them!

516
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,600

Jiang Yuanbao.

542
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,240
You are still kneeling.

543
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,800
Jiang Yuanbao.

544
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,360
Do you think you can escape

00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,040
if you kill me?

546
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
I can tell you

that even if you kill me,

548
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,040
you can't escape.

549
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,120
The people of the city

550
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,040
have surrounded the whole capital.

551
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,240
Let's talk about it.

552
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,840

Then, even if you are a great man,

557
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,440
the future of Ronghua will not be as precious as you.

558
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,640
Li Zhongnan.

559
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,040
I've been with you for a long time.

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,440
Take him down.

561
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,640
Don't move.

562
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,040
You can't escape.

563
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,840
Go.

564
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,640
You can't escape.

565
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,240
Hurry up.

00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,440
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.

569
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,440
You have a chance.

570
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,840
I'll leave it to you.

571
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,840
The soldiers of the Zhao State will follow me

572
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,440
to the city.

573
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,240
Yes.

574
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,440
Come with me.

575
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,040
Search all the public places.

576
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,840
Yes.

577
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,240
Go.

578
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,440
You're not my son.

579
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,040
Where's the blood?

580
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,240
Why haven't you arrived yet?

581
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,240
Listen to my command.

582
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,240
Protect the people of this city.

583
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,240
Yes.

584
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,240
Don't kill them.

585
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
Your Majesty, leave now.

586
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,240
Hurry up.

587
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,440
Hurry up.

588
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,040
Your Majesty.

589
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,440
How is it?

590
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,640
It's still possible.

591
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,040
Jiang Xianggu, please send His Majesty to the State Palace first.

592
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,440
Okay.

593
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,040
Lord.

594
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,240
Your Majesty,

595
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,640
the Luwu Army is here.

596
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,240
If we can't stop the Luwu Army,

597
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
they will soon catch up with the State Palace.

598
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,840
I can stop them.

599
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:40,840
Sun Zi.

600
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,640
Sun Zi.

601
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,640
I saved your wife.

602
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,440
So big.

603
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,040
Be careful.

604
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,840
Yu Fu is in the hands of Shen Yurong.

605
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
He's crazy. He wants to kill you.

606
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,400
Old man,

607
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,200
send your body to the Palace.

608
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,000
Master.

609
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,240
I'll go with you.

610
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
Everyone, listen to my order.

611
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,440
Protect His Majesty first.

612
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,280
Go.

613
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,440
Xiao Hong.

614
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,840
I'll go with you.

615
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,120
Where is he going?

616
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,200
He's going to take Long Wujun to the city.

617
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,200
What?

618
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,760
He's going to die.

619
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,320
My son

620
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,520
gave me a good grandson.

621
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,760
Do you have a bow?

622
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,440
Bow.

623
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,360
That man

624
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,760
only taught me how to shoot.

625
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
Xiao Hong.

626
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,160
Xiao Hong.

627
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,320
I'm still looking for you.

628
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,080
How dare you come here

629
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,640
and shoot?

630
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,480
Go.

631
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,400
Long Wujun, listen to my order.

632
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,880
Kill Xiao Hong.

633
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,040
Go.

634
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,760
Leave.

635
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,040
Xiao Hong.

636
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,520
I didn't want to kill you.

637
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,040
But Alie fell in love with you.

638
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,840
Because of you,

639
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,400
she didn't want to see me.

640
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,080
Even I gave her my heart.

641
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,320
She didn't want to take it.

642
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
When you were buried in Qingcheng Mountain,

643
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,480
you didn't think about this day?

644
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,520
Shut up.

645
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,000
Shen Xueshi.

646
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,800
How dare you face the past?

647
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,720
Xiao Hong.

648
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,760
You're dead.

649
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,960
How dare you be so arrogant?

650
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,720
Alie said you're a spy.

651
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,360
You're right.

652
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,080
You're not qualified to call her Alie.

653
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,680
You're now a poor man.

654
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,760
You'll never see her again.

655
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,600
Xiao Hong.

656
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,680
No one can save you.

657
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,200
It's okay.

658
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,560
Let's go.

659
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,800
Death is death.

660
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,760
Refresh your life.

661
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

662
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

663
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

664
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

665
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

666
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

667
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

668
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

669
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

670
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

671
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

672
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

673
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

674
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

675
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,320
In the long night,

676
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:42,320
I'm holding the warmth that is left.

677
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,320
I'm too deep.

678
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,320
I can't hold back.

679
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:57,320
Can I bury the traces of yesterday?

680
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,320
Love is a sentence.

681
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,320
Use life to cherish.

682
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,320
Fire continues.

683
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Even if a little hurt.

684
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,320
No matter if it hurts or hurts.

685
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,320
I believe in you.

686
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

687
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

688
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

689
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

690
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

691
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

692
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

693
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

694
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

695
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

696
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

697
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

698
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

699
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

700
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

701
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

702
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:02,320
I'm not afraid of the cold.

703
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,320
The cold.

704
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,320
If we could be together,

705
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:15,320
I could be cold and free to free to be free.
