1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
What's going on?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,560
It's about time you returned...

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,720
Helping each other...

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,080
What's the big deal?

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,640
Why are you so grand?

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,520
My brother is on the breeding back of this year...

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,120
We are in a pair,

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,720
so we need to be grander over the whole thing.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,480
What's the big deal in the nightac Dicky Bay?

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,320
I need to explain it to you

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,240
because there is no OK with me!

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,840
Come on.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
We'llè™•p the hands on this team.

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,560
I'm not wearing this one.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,680
Can you?

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,820
Themezheng Idol

17
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,780
ensures the paradise

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,680
and peace makes them close.

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,800
I'll do it.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,920
Its impossible to break

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm falling.

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,520
The iron is not fragile.

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,720
But I still want to be with you.

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,520
Are you tired?

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,720
I'm glad.

26
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,520
I'll let you have it.

27
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,720
You love to have it or not?

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,520
A'Li, don't be angry.

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,720
If you don't have it, you'll be late.

30
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,320
I'm afraid of the years.

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,720
I'm afraid of the years.

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
I'm afraid of the years.

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,920
You ask.

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,920
A'Li,

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
you'll have to watch it now.

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,920
I'm going to the famous theater tomorrow to teach poetry.

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
I have to prepare.

38
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,920
Go to bed first.

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
What about me?

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
You don't have anything to teach me.

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
What do you want to learn?

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
A'Li,

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
is this it?

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
Don't you know?

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
And I taught you.

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
You taught me.

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
I know.

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
What about this?

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure.

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm not sure.

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
I'm not sure.

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
I'm not sure.

53
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
I'm not sure.

54
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
I'm not sure.

55
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
I'm not sure.

56
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
I'm not sure.

57
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
I'm not sure.

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
What about this?

59
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
You learn fast.

60
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,920
I'll teach you a few more.

61
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
What's this?

62
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,920
It's from September.

63
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
He said he'd thank me

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
and give it to him.

65
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,920
I didn't give me so many things

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,920
when I was his birthday.

67
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
What's this?

68
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
This is for you.

69
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,920
It can make your eyes look more beautiful.

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
What about this?

71
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
It's for me.

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
It's from the pig's eye powder.

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
What about this?

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
It's for you.

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
It's from the cologne.

76
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
What about this?

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
This...

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
It's from September.

79
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
I don't know this.

80
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Don't sleep.

81
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
You're listening to the story.

82
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Let me tell you.

83
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,920
He has a story about the Eastern Sea.

84
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
It's so good.

85
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,920
My dad just told me about it last night.

86
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Yes.

87
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
He told your mom

88
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
to tell you about it.

89
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Yes.

90
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
He told your mom.

91
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
She has a story about a beautiful woman.

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
It's so good.

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,920
I'll tell you a new story.

94
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
Well...

95
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
I'll tell you a story about your dad and mom.

96
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Okay?

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
It's been a long time since I've told you.

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
I don't want to tell you a new story.

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Do you want to hear it?

100
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Yes.

101
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Where do you start?

102
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
I'll tell you a story.

103
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
What do you think?

104
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,920
This year is the eighth year we're married.

105
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
The world is stable.

106
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
The people are rich.

107
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
I'm in the imperial court.

108
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
We have a daughter.

109
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
When A'Li and Ye are in the first-class mastermind,

110
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
she's busy with her work.

111
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
It doesn't matter.

112
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Life is full of many ways.

113
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
There are people who love each other.

114
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
There are people who care about each other.

115
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
They will always be together.

116
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Okay.

117
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
There are too many words.

118
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
They're not my personality.

119
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,920
So, A'Li and I

120
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
will talk about it here for a while.

121
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
I heard that you miss her.

122
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
She's looking after me

123
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
in the busy world.

124
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Life is hard to avoid.

125
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Sometimes, life is hard to avoid.

126
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
But the innocent

127
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
is always there for you.

128
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
Xiao Heng is my wife.

129
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
I wish every one of you

130
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
a good-for-nothing.

131
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
I wish you good luck.

132
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
I wish you good luck.

133
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
That's all.

134
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
We'll meet again.
