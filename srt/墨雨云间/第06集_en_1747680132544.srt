1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm lost in the world

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my plans

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's just a page of a book written in your heart

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A fox in my heart

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Accept all the gifts of love

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of regrets

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Slowly reject the suffering of the world

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I walk through the winter and the summer and the autumn are still the same

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Waiting for the spring to return again

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yao'er

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
My Yao'er

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Madam

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yao'er, what's wrong?

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The pillow, look, it's full of pillows

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Did you bring any cologne just now?

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This third madam, she can't touch cologne since she was a child

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Everyone in this house knows that

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
She won't wear cologne

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Did she bring any ice on her body?

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Say it directly

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Madam

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Madam, what happened after the second madam took the cologne to the earrings?

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Could it be the cologne?

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Take off the earrings and take a look

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Madam, what do you mean?

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I know you are not satisfied

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And you don't like the third madam that much

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But this is too much

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't dislike Ruoyao

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I don't put cologne

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is dirty and dirty

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What's there to deny?

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Li'er

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What's going on?

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Father

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't know

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Father

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Could you give me and Ruoyao some time to be alone?

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What do you want?

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I had similar symptoms when I was in Zhennv Hall

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I know a way to make Ruoyao feel better

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What way?

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Can't father and I see it?

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Mother, listen to me

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You and father are both here

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What are you afraid of?

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
She has left

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Just tell me why you hurt me

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Third sister

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I didn't mean to steal your style today

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
As your sister

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I just want to congratulate you like other sisters

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Someone doesn't want me to go to your wedding

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't pretend to be innocent

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I ask you

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Why did you use cologne to hurt me?

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You know you are afraid of cologne

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And you have to endure the pain and use bitter meat

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
To vent your anger

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's really hard for you

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Then there's nothing to say

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let father come in

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let him see your vicious face

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I let them out to save your face

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you sure that they will punish me for a bitter meal?

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What do you mean?

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you insist that I framed you

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I will help you to deduce what will happen later

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
First

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I will let my maid Xiangqiao testify for me

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
After I bought this earring

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
She has been keeping it for me

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I have never touched it before

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I know

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Xiangqiao is your mother and yours

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So she will frame me without any reason

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Second sister put those cologne in

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I saw it with my own eyes

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Nonsense

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You are lying

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Xiangqiao

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I saw that your conscience was taken away by the wolf

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So you dare to slander my wife

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You are wronged

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If I have a word of falsehood

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I will be struck by lightning

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Then

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Mother will use the question

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Li'er

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If you are dissatisfied

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Just come to me

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If she is your sister

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How can you bear to do this?

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You don't care about your family

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Isn't it the truth?

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Of course not

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Because the earring with the cologne is a fake

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What?

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
A few days ago

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I spent 20 taels of silver in the Jixianglou in the capital city

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
To buy this earring

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The earring of this color and price

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Is not seen in the whole store

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And this one is made of thick and rough

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's not even 20 taels

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's even worse than one tael

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Our grandmother is a person who knows the goods

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
She can tell it at a glance

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The products of Jixianglou

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Can't be of this quality

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Then the question is

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Who changed the earring I was going to give you?

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You don't have to slander Xiangqiao

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
She is not that brave

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The courage is from the human taste

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
During this time

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I have been giving Xiangqiao good things

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The one who feeds good things

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Is naturally a brave man

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
She thought

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I will be kicked out sooner or later

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This expensive earring

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Will fall into my mother's hands sooner or later

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's better to keep it in my hand

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You think too stupid

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Who will believe you in your words?

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Coincidence

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There is a witness

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I wasn't sure that Xiangqiao would change

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So I asked Tong'er to follow her

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But she did go to the expert

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The expert of the food

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Father went to ask

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
She had everything

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So what?

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
A greedy maid

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How can she say that

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
She put the spices?

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There is a evidence

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The spices are in Xiangqiao's room

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If you don't believe me

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I will tell father now

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let him check it

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
How is that possible?

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's not that Xiangqiao is not good at doing things

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But the people in this world

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Most of them don't change the earring

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But change the earring

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yun Shuang has been jealous of her

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Madam gave it to me

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I know

157
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I will warn you one last time

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't ruin Madam's good thing

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you still remember that I brought you into the house

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't make trouble

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So what if you brought me into the house?

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Why do you always talk about it?

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's all about ability

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You are not happy

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can't be compared with others

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I am sorry

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know what to do

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I will be back soon

169
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I will leave now

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Bye

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Bye

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000

Bye

193
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's been so long

194
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What is Li'er doing?

195
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Let them talk more

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Both daughters are grown up

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What can they do?

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Since you have so clear vision

199
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why do you want to tell me alone?

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Why didn't you tell them

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
when everyone was here?

202
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't want to be your enemy

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But don't try to drive me away

204
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I am back to take back what belongs to me

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you continue to be my partner

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I won't let you go

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's all I want to say

208
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
As for whether to put the hat of the victim

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
on my head

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You decide

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Li'er grew up in Zhennv Hall

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We are not familiar with his temper

213
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He is determined

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But he may not do it well

215
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We are standing outside

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I am worried about him

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Father

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Li'er is much better

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yao'er

220
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How are you?

221
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Much better

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Thanks to you

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We misunderstood your ear injury

224
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yao'er

225
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Tell me

226
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What misunderstanding?

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I am a little tired now

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I want to sleep

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's good that you have solved the misunderstanding

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Madam

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Don't worry too much

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yao'er

233
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You should have a good rest

234
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Go back

235
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Mother

236
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Give me the antidote

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What did she say to you?

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Mother

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You asked me to give birth to a child

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's not good at all

241
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The maid who went to the country to deliver the baby

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
is also not good enough

243
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Is it over?

244
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I heard it was a misunderstanding

246
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Call the maid here

247
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes

248
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Greetings, grandmother

249
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I made pear soup

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I remember you came

251
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Thank you

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Come, sit here

253
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I heard that Ruo Yao is sick

254
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Her mother asked you to ask her

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What happened?

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Nothing serious

257
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's just that she is not feeling well

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The people in front are talking

259
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You are so cruel

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The gift you gave her

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
became a poison

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Your mother is not happy

263
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Tell me the truth

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The maid in my room

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
made trouble

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
She mixed up the gift I want to give her

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Mother will punish them

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You are so sensible

269
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You are wronged

270
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's so heart-breaking

271
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Today I drank the pear soup

272
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What else is wronged?

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I remember

274
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The two maids in your room

275
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
were selected by your mother

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Mrs. Zhang

277
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Go to the Fangfei Court with Li'er

278
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes

279
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Grandmother

280
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is my idea

281
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Just be obedient

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and listen to me

283
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You are not at home

284
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This is our world

285
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We can

286
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
go back and forth

287
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Brother Zhang

288
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Brother Li, Brother Zhao

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Why are you here?

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We are here to catch you

291
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What are you doing?

292
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Catch what?

293
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Don't move

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let go

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Don't move

296
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Let go

297
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Take these two maids out

298
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You are a family

299
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Mrs. Zhang

300
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Are you mistaken?

301
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Mrs. Zhang

302
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We wronged you

303
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yes

304
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Take them out

305
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Mrs. Zhang

306
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Brother Zhang

307
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We are wronged

308
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We are wronged

309
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Xiangqiao

310
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's your fault

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What's wrong with me?

312
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Let's go

313
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's go

314
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Let's go

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Mother, we are wronged

316
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Let go

317
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
We are wronged

318
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Let's go

319
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Mrs. Zhang is shocked

320
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
She has ordered

321
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
to send maids here tomorrow

322
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and keep Shi Huan

323
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Thank you, grandmother

324
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and thank you for coming

325
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
to have some tea

326
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You are still replying

327
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Mrs. Zhang, take a rest

328
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay

329
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Zhang Li

330
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You won the battle

331
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Your grandmother

332
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
never asked

333
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
about the family affairs

334
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
She went out of the mountain

335
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
for you

336
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and helped you

337
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
to finish everything

338
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What did you do?

339
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
She is kind

340
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What do you mean?

341
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
She won't tell you

342
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
what she thinks

343
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
even if she gets it right

344
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
She asked Mrs. Zhang

345
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
to come here

346
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and help you to finish everything

347
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You can

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
be as high as a mountain

349
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and never be

350
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
hurt by those tricks

351
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Thank you

352
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
my good cousin

353
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Jingrui

354
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
or Xiaoruirui

355
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Men are short

356
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and I like

357
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
your Guigui

358
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I heard

359
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
your chrysanthemum tea

360
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
is very good

361
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Take me to try

362
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Let's go

363
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Madam

364
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Those maids

365
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
have already left

366
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm sorry

367
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Madam

368
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Those maids

369
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
have already left

370
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Tomorrow

371
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
go and help Zhang Huiyan

372
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
pick a good person

373
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
to send her

374
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yes

375
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Zhang has been married for so many years

376
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why can't she let go of her eyes?

377
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
She has come back

378
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
with nothing

379
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and suffered

380
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
in the mountain

381
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What can she do

382
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
if she is happy

383
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
with her?

384
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yuanbai is all about her

385
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Women

386
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I can't say

387
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
that Yuanbai is not good

388
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You are smart

389
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You will be safe in the future

390
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll take your advice

391
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Why did Madam

392
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
ask about this?

393
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't know

394
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I heard that

395
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Madam

396
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
suddenly changed her

397
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and sold her

398
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
maids

399
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
She said she was going to

400
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
send a new person in

401
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
She is beating me

402
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But Madam

403
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
didn't go on

404
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It means

405
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
she doesn't want to

406
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
turn her face

407
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It was a chance

408
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
for Ruoyao

409
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
but she was the one

410
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
who made a big trouble

411
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I had to

412
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
give her hair

413
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
in front of everyone

414
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
If so

415
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I have to

416
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
take the responsibility

417
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
of being a mother

418
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What do you think?

419
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Since she has already

420
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
cut her hair

421
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
she should

422
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
think about her marriage

423
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
in case

424
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
someone says that I am a bad person

425
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Madam

426
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
My name is Bai Xue

427
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
This is her birth certificate

428
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Madam, look

429
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
If you like it

430
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
keep it

431
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Thank you, Madam

432
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Thank you, Madam

433
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Madam

434
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I am strong

435
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and strong

436
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I can clean the yard

437
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I see on the book

438
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
that your hometown

439
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
is in Zaohua Village

440
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I know a girl

441
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
She is also from Zaohua Village

442
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What is her name?

443
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Maybe I know her

444
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Haitang

445
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
She is in her early twenties

446
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
She has two younger brothers

447
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I have never heard of that

448
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But

449
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
her parents

450
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
have lived in Zaohua Village for a long time

451
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I will write a letter to my family

452
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and ask them

453
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Thank you

454
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Sister

455
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
why do you want to find

456
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
the girl named Haitang?

457
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Haitang

458
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
is my former maid

459
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
After that

460
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I have never seen her

461
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But she disappeared strangely

462
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Maybe she knows something

463
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But now I am not sure

464
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
if she was killed

465
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If I can find her

466
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
the truth

467
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
may be clear

468
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Madam

469
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Madam

470
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Madam

471
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Madam

472
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Husband

473
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
you are back

474
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Are you alright?

475
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Does it hurt?

476
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
let the servants do it.

477
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,280
For so many years,

478
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,480
I've never put my husband's clothes

479
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
in someone else's hands.

480
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,080
Everything in this house

481
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
has to be done by this one hand.

482
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
Madam, you've worked hard.

483
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
I learned it slowly

484
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,080
after I got married.

485
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,400
In the past, at home,

486
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,600
my parents didn't teach me these.

487
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
They only let me practice the zither.

488
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Yes.

489
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
When we first met,

490
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,760
your father was having a banquet at home.

491
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
You played a song.

492
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,760
I still can't forget it.

493
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
But now,

494
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
these hands

495
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
are damaged by the things in the house.

496
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
My hard work

497
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
is nothing compared to your hard work.

498
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
You must be tired.

499
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Here.

500
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
Have some tea.

501
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Okay.

502
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
I can't always

503
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
take care of Li'er.

504
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
I feel so ashamed

505
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
to do this to this mother.

506
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
You can't blame her completely.

507
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
Although Li'er has been in the mountains for many years,

508
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,960
she is a good girl.

509
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
I want to find a good husband for Li'er.

510
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
I heard

511
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
that the son of Minister of Personnel

512
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
is still unmarried.

513
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
He has a good appearance and temperament.

514
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,960
His family background is not good.

515
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,960
The key is under the husband.

516
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
But he is a loyal and kind person.

517
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
It's not easy to be

518
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
a good husband in the court.

519
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Zhao Qi is also a good man

520
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,960
and full of good looks.

521
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,960
I think he will be good to Li'er.

522
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Li'er was raised in Zhennv Hall.

523
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
She didn't study properly.

524
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
Her reputation was not good.

525
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,960
His Majesty favors women.

526
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
His family doesn't want to

527
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
marry a good daughter-in-law.

528
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,960
This is a short term.

529
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
If someone wants to marry your husband

530
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,960
for nothing,

531
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
but he has a lot of detestation and hate.

532
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Isn't it my fault?

533
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,960
So I searched for a long time

534
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
to find the Zhao family.

535
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
I asked them what they meant.

536
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
They are really willing.

537
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Besides, Li'er has a husband.

538
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
He will not suffer

539
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,040
if he marries her.

540
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,040
You are right.

541
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
But we should also

542
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,040
see what Li'er means.

543
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Why do you keep staring at me?

544
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,120
I think Li'er has grown up.

545
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,120
It's time to marry a good woman.

546
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
I just came back.

547
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Are you going to drive me away?

548
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
You are talking nonsense.

549
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,120
I just met my father.

550
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,120
I have to get divorced.

551
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
I feel sad.

552
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
I feel sad.

553
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
It's not like you are forcing yourself to marry now.

554
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
You should think about it first.

555
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
If you have a good one, then you should make up your mind.

556
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Then you can talk about marriage.

557
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Your mother has worked hard

558
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
in your life.

559
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
You can't let her down, right?

560
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Okay.

561
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,280
I will listen to my father.

562
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Sister, why did Ji Shuran

563
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
introduce you to Liang Xu?

564
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,280
Ji Shuran didn't want me to stay at home

565
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
so he married me.

566
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,280
What is Zhao Qi's background?

567
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
I heard about him.

568
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
He is a talent.

569
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
He was a scholar in the Imperial College three years ago.

570
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
He is a famous scholar.

571
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,360
He is a famous scholar.

572
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
His Majesty personally gave him a reward.

573
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
But he refused to enter the family.

574
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
How can Ji Shuran

575
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
let such a good person

576
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
marry me?

577
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
Maybe if he is not good enough,

578
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,360
Lord can't easily accept it.

579
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
There must be something wrong.

580
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Then you should tell Lord

581
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
to push him away.

582
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
No.

583
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
He just said

584
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Ji Shuran was not good enough.

585
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
If I mention it again,

586
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
I will be in trouble.

587
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
Sister, what if he goes to see the old lady?

588
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
Find a good match for Ji Nv.

589
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
What if he is just a little anxious?

590
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Is there anything wrong with Ji Shuran?

591
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Well...

592
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
There is no big mistake.

593
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Lord can't blame him.

594
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
This matter

595
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,520
should be handled by myself.

596
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Prime Minister Jiang.

597
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
Zhao Qi.

598
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
Greetings, Prime Minister Jiang.

599
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Greetings, Madam Jiang.

600
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
Not bad.

601
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,520
You are really a good woman.

602
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,520
Lady Jiang, you are so beautiful.

603
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
Greetings, Madam Zhao.

604
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
I am a little bit flattered.

605
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Please sit.

606
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Please have a seat.

607
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
Your Highness.

608
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
There are some good scenes

609
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
in our house.

610
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
If you come out,

611
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,520
I can show you around.

612
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Not bad.

613
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
Madam Jiang, please.

614
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,520
Finding a good husband for Jiang Li

615
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
is the best way to deal with him.

616
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Zhao made a mistake a few years ago.

617
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
He had to surrender to my father

618
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
to get away from it.

619
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
My father held him tight for the rest of his life.

620
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
I hate Jiang Li.

621
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Marrying him to the Zhao family

622
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
without us.

623
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,520
Someone will never be able to do anything for him.

624
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Madam Jiang.

625
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
Zhao Qi prepared a gift in the kitchen.

626
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
She prepared a gift for you.

627
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
This is a rouge?

628
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Yes.

629
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,600
This rouge is made of purple jasmine.

630
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
The red color is a little bit cold.

631
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
It's not common.

632
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,600
It's not suitable for ordinary women.

633
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
But it's suitable for Lady Jiang.

634
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
You are so considerate.

635
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
It's a pity that I can't return it.

636
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
It's okay.

637
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Han Xun has lived with the doctor for ten years.

638
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Now she is back.

639
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,680
I think she is a good person.

640
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,680
How about we just say it?

641
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,680
Mr. Zhao is so generous.

642
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
I don't like to be a gossip.

643
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Great.

644
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Then I won't act anymore.

645
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
I tell you, Madam Jiang.

646
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
My parents

647
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,680
hope that my family can be a good person.

648
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
So I hope that

649
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
after the wedding,

650
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Madam Jiang will be able to open a business.

651
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,680
You are so straightforward.

652
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,680
But you are too early.

653
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
Well,

654
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,680
I can't say more.

655
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
You can't be so serious.

656
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
You will be popular.

657
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
You will be popular.

658
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
You will be popular.

659
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,680
You never think that I will reject you.

660
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,680
You dare to reject me?

661
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
No?

662
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
You are kidding.

663
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Where can you go except kiss?

664
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
Where can you go except kiss?

665
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,760
The marriage is just a family.

666
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,760
I am the legitimate daughter of the Jiang family.

667
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
How capable you are

668
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
under your father's command?

669
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
Do I need to reject you?

670
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
Do you really think that

671
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
you are the legitimate daughter of the Jiang family?

672
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
You are the only man in the world.

673
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,760
Now how do the children in the capital think of you?

674
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
I'm afraid you don't know.

675
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Then I will ask Mr. Zhao to teach me.

676
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Then I will just talk to you.

677
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
The most important thing in a family is

678
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
to pay attention to each other's face.

679
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,840
The appearance and talent are the same.

680
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
The main thing is the innocence of a woman.

681
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
How about Madam Jiang?

682
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,840
The clothes are so vulgar.

683
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,920
The color of your hair is very unique.

684
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Your skin is not healthy.

685
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
As for your talent,

686
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
you have been in the mountain field for ten years

687
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
and never had any education.

688
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,920
So how many people do you know?

689
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
As for your reputation,

690
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,920
you are well known for your good looks.

691
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
If you are a commoner,

692
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
you have to marry a good-looking man.

693
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,920
But you are the legitimate daughter of the Jiang family.

694
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
You can choose some good-looking men.

695
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Or you can be a gardener.

696
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But even if you want,

697
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
your family will not be ashamed of it.

698
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
In the capital,

699
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
no one is better than you.

700
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
No one is better than you.

701
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So your family does not look down on others.

702
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So our family has decided today

703
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
to burn the incense in the highland.

704
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So I have to marry you?

705
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
What else?

706
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Such a noble Mr. Zhao

707
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,080
How can he be willing to marry a man like me?

708
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Open the branch and spread the leaves.

709
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Mr. Zhao, you are not young anymore.

710
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,080
Men are not as good as women.

711
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,080
I can see your eyes and feet.

712
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
Really?

713
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
No.

714
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
What do you want to say?

715
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,160
A good man like you in the capital,

716
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,160
you are so young.

717
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,160
You only care about your parents.

718
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
There is only one possibility.

719
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
What is it?

720
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,160
You have a good match and you can't get married.

721
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,160
I didn't expect that the second lady would be so funny.

722
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Have a grape.

723
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Why?

724
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
You are not worthy of the reputation of the Zhao family.

725
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Which lady is she?

726
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
What are you talking about?

727
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
I know what others don't know.

728
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
When I was young,

729
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,240
I saw a beautiful lady in the house.

730
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,240
She was a man and a husband.

731
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
She liked you but she didn't dare to take you home.

732
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
She was afraid that her parents would scold her.

733
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
She didn't care about marriage.

734
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,240
Fortunately, she is not old.

735
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,320
I have many excuses to delay this matter.

736
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
Now I am old.

737
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
How can my parents allow you to do this?

738
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,320
You can't delay it.

739
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,320
You are afraid of revealing your private life.

740
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,320
So you have to find a married man who can take care of you.

741
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,320
But the man who can take care of you doesn't like you.

742
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,320
They think you are old and haggard.

743
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
You are not good enough.

744
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Your parents are not willing to marry you.

745
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
So you like me.

746
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
A famous woman.

747
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,400
You are begging me to save you.

748
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,400
I will save you.

749
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Nonsense.

750
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,400
You are really talented.

751
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
You are a talented man.

752
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
You...

753
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
What?

754
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Zhao Qi, I told you before.

755
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
I won't marry you.

756
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
First, I am blind.

757
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
I can't see anything.

758
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
Second, I have other things to do.

759
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
I can't marry anyone.

760
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
You can go to the wedding.

761
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:37,480
Or I will take my family to your family's house.

762
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Are you threatening me?

763
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Not threatening.

764
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,480
It's just a matter of our marriage.

765
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,480
What I am going to say is a threat.

766
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Zhao Qi, listen.

767
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,560
You can play with a woman without a marriage certificate.

768
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,560
You can take a good woman to your family's house.

769
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,560
I have never heard of this.

770
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
It's okay if you treat me like this.

771
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,560
If I know you use this kind of way to treat other women,

772
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
I will be in trouble.

773
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,560
I will make your family lose its reputation in the capital.

774
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
Let's go.

775
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
Let's go.

776
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,640
Besides, I am afraid that you will be in trouble.

777
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,640
I have a day to take care of myself.

778
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
You have been there for so long.

779
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,640
I am afraid you are getting along well.

780
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Come.

781
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Mr. Zhao seems to dislike me.

782
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
What?

783
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Yes, mother.

784
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Let's discuss this marriage.

785
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
I...

786
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
I am sorry.

787
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
Sister, you are so good.

788
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
How do you know she is getting along well?

789
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,720
I had an old friend who was hurt by this kind of person.

790
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Since we had Ping'an, she never touched me.

791
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,720
She is happy to drink with her.

792
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,720
Lady Xue, I am so sorry to tell you this.

793
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,800
What are you going to do in the future?

794
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
I have Ping'an now.

795
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Her family has a descendant.

796
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,800
No matter how happy she is, her parents can't control her.

797
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
That's my life.

798
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,800
But you must remember this in your heart.

799
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,800
This kind of person is so shameless to stare at women's belly

800
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,800
just for the sake of the family.

801
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Women make mistakes and make mistakes.

802
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Men are so manly.

803
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Their families try their best to cover up for her.

804
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,880
It's so shameless.

805
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,880
But Ji Shuran has made up her mind to drive you out of the family.

806
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,880
And marriage is always decided by the parents.

807
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Today, a Mr. Zhao left.

808
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Tomorrow, a Mr. Niu and Mr. Ma will come.

809
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,880
What should we do in the future?

810
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,880
If you want to stay in the Jiang family, you have to find another way.

811
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
What way?

812
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Go out.

813
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
What are you doing?

814
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Yang Song is suspected of colluding with salt merchants and selling salt.

815
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
We are ordered to take him.

816
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,040
Where is Jiang Qisuo?

817
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
There are all eunuchs in the house.

818
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,040
Even if it's a secret place, you can't break in.

819
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,040
Mrs. Yang, since there are eunuchs, we won't go in and search.

820
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Please ask Mrs. Qin to invite him out.

821
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Mr. Su, you must have made a mistake.

822
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,040
My husband would never do such a thing.

823
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
He has been a clean and honest official all his life.

824
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
The things outside can't come in.

825
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,040
He has been tossing things in the house a lot.

826
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
How could such a person break the law?

827
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
Mrs. Qin, sit down.

828
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
Sit down, Mrs. Qin.

829
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,040
I believe you don't know about this.

830
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
I have investigated many cases like this.

831
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,440
Even the Ministry of Justice has been

832
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
looking for the culprit.

833
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,440
But you are still crying.

834
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,440
I don't know that even His Majesty's kindness has been failed.

835
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,440
The emperor was angry and he was unwilling to give up.

836
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,440
Do you know where these people went?

837
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,440
They became eunuchs and were locked in the ministry of education.

838
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,440
I don't know who let them down.

839
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
It's fine to be angry.

840
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,440
But the eunuchs' children became eunuchs.

841
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,440
They have no future.

842
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
Where is Yang Song?

843
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,280
The

844
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,400
rented book...

845
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,600
isyun 我

846
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,040
Your Majesty,

847
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,480
Yan Teddi takie ni tills

848
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
is my failure.

849
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
I am willing to be punished.

850
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
But before that,

851
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,080
I beg Your Majesty to give me a chance to make up for my mistakes.

852
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,360
I will severely punish Yan Tieci.

853
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,880
Duke Su, you saved Yan Tieci from the insects.

854
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,120
I am very grateful.

855
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,720
You don't need to be so proud of me.

856
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,560
I have made such a great effort to catch a small insect for you.

857
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,960
I am so incompetent.

858
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,920
I will not let you pay for this crime.

859
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,680
Duke Su, you have done a great service in the private case.

860
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,080
As for Yan Tieci, he has been killed.

861
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,960
The whole case is not in the morning.

862
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,600
It is a matter of the future.

863
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,400
But I am afraid that the future needs to be decided by this.

864
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,160
I know very well.

865
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,640
I will not disappoint Your Majesty.

866
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,040
You may leave.

867
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,840
Shen Qing.

868
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,040
Yes.

869
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,200
How was the progress on the reformation of the previous department?

870
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,280
Your Majesty,

871
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,040
I have already removed the paper of the Juzi Yutou and the bow and arrow.

872
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,600
The paper has been set.

873
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,560
The new Hu Mingzhi has been promoted in the recent period.

874
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,760
Next year, the department will be tested.

875
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,000
All major test sites will use the new paper.

876
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,840
The test sites near the capital have been set up.

877
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,640
The students from Hanmen who have just finished the exam

878
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:12,640
will be given the

879
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,400
opportunity to test.

880
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,040
But after the new paper has been removed,

881
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,680
the burden of the examiners will be heavy.

882
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,240
I heard that there were some misjudgments in the test sites.

883
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,840
The examiners have been in the government office.

884
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,280
The battle in the capital has also been a mess.

885
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,240
The department has been in the government office for three years.

886
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,000
The examiners have been in the government office for one year.

887
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,080
The excellent students will be eliminated,

888
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,360
while the mediocre students will be selected.

889
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,120
If the main examiners can understand some students

890
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,200
who have real talent and real knowledge through the paper,

891
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,120
they will be able to eliminate them in a more efficient way.

892
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,760
I'm afraid that they will lose some of their skills.

893
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,680
In a more efficient way?

894
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,840
Is it because of the real talent and real knowledge of the students

895
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,680
or because of the family background of the students?

896
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,360
Your Majesty,

897
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,240
I think that since the paper has been removed,

898
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,680
it's right to eliminate the paper

899
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,480
that will give the examiners and the examiners a chance to collude.

900
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,880
As for what Prime Minister Li said,

901
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,080
the wrong thing is not to be distracted by the new paper,

902
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,840
but to be in the student government office.

903
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,080
The selection of officials to lead the student government office

904
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,680
to accept the new paper,

905
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,760
this is the only way to eliminate the fundamental problem.

906
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:18,920
First,

907
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,560
let's not mention that the new paper showed some 느�ANCY,

908
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,480
and in that case,

909
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,360
the filthy words ominously appeared.

910
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,920
Next,

911
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,720
凭什么?

912
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,240
You don't have a born abbot body,

913
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
and you can simply make up for one.

914
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,440
If you want to remove the paper,

915
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,200
just focus on the story of late autumn,

916
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,360
The six imperial schools have been broken down for years.

917
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,440
The talented people like Zhao Qi

918
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,800
are no longer officials.

919
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,200
As for Mingyi Hall,

920
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,720
when it first opened, it was the new female school of our dynasty.

921
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,160
It has been a little slack in the past two years.

922
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,280
I will take care of the two broken down schools this year.

923
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,400
Take a good look at them for me.

924
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,520
Take away those young people who are high in status

925
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,880
and have real talent and knowledge.

926
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

927
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,640
Yes.

928
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,240
paradise

929
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,480
My Lord,

930
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,360
That innocent old fox

931
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,400
should rob us from false information.

932
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,540
He lost his reputation

933
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,300
due to this rotation and turning stage.

934
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,120
Can't we take action against him right now

935
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,840
By watching him support us

936
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,440
let Yang JIng tell us

937
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
that he is just a betting king.

938
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,400
This is the best tea this year.

939
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,000
Judge Kun, have a cup.

940
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,600
You can pour more if you spill the tea.

941
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
But if someone holds your tail,

942
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
it won't be easy to get rid of it.

943
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,200
I was careless.

944
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,400
But don't worry.

945
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,200
I've already brushed Yan Tisi.

946
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,400
Don't worry.

947
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
I've already brushed Yan Tisi.

948
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,000
He won't be able to find out.

949
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I hope so.

950
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,000
Father.

951
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Do you know what I asked you to do?

952
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
The money from Yan Tisi is out of stock.

953
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,600
We really need to use money.

954
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,800
We need to make up for this.

955
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,000
Where do we start?

956
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,400
The Ye family.

957
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,200
The Ye family and the Jiang family are good friends.

958
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Since Jiang Yuanbai died,

959
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,600
Ye Zhenzhen's daughter, Jiang Li, was sent to Zhennv Hall.

960
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,000
The Ye family and the Jiang family

961
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,200
have been in a bad relationship.

962
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,600
Although the Ye family is rich, they are not rich.

963
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,800
The Ye family tried to

964
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:35,700
make Ye Shijie's son go to the

965
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,200
I gave you my name.

966
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,800
Father.

967
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,000
Father.

968
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Father.

969
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,800
Why aren't you drinking?

970
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,200
For your health.

971
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,880
and the drunkenness of the Hall of Fame.

972
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,400
You're really a talent.

973
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,400
Thank you, Your Highness.

974
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,720
Both are the schools of our talents.

975
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,640
I must do my best to take care of His Majesty.

976
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,840
If this is a normal assessment,

977
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,280
it should be boring.

978
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,560
How about a perfect match?

979
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,800
Let the young master of the Imperial College

980
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,680
and the ladies of the Hall of Fame

981
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,240
to form a free group.

982
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,960
It should be a lot of fun.

983
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,040
I'm looking forward to it.

984
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,040
No.

985
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,800
After all, the age of the age is different.

986
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,680
What's wrong with the sign of interest?

987
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,680
If, as you said,

988
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,840
the students are inevitably?

989
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,400
In the future, they will be the same as the party and take personal interests.

990
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,400
And those who originally have real talent

991
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,680
but are not good at socializing

992
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,520
and have little family background

993
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,440
may be bribed.

994
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,760
This is not good for the government and the people of our country.

995
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,840
You're really a young master with no clothes on.

996
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,160
I don't like you talking to me like this.

997
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
I'm not comfortable.

998
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,200
Kneel down.

999
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,360
Your Highness.

1000
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,040
Kneel down.

1001
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,600
Once upon a time...

1002
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,160
What are you...

1003
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,560
What are you doing?

1004
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,440
Not after school.

1005
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,200
Your Highness.

1006
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,080
What did I miss?

1007
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,320
Re Merry,

1008
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,800
you can come up if you like.

1009
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:55,840
After class,

1010
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,700
I

1011
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,440
have to put a vớie

1012
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,440
The more I think about it, the more I feel sad

1013
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Two cold and cold, the heartless battle

1014
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,440
Holding hands, can we get through the snow?

1015
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,440
In the cold wind, in the long night

1016
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:36,440
Embracing the remaining warmth

1017
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:51,440
Holding on, not sure if we can bury the regret from yesterday

1018
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:58,440
Love is to cherish with life

1019
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:06,440
To live on, even if it's a little hurt

1020
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:14,440
No matter sorrow or joy, I believe in you

1021
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,440
I'd rather be trapped in the coldness of the world

1022
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:28,440
To live on, to be brave

1023
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:36,440
Love until you breathe

1024
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:44,440
Through the loneliness of half life, just to meet you

1025
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,440
After being extricated, I won't stay away

1026
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,440
After being extricated, I won't stay away
