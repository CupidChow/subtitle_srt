The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You've had your night off.

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You can't just have one pot.

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Tong, stop playing with water.

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Give me the water.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Give me the water.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Wipe the pillars.

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Wipe all the pillars.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Come on.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Put it here.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Put it on the floor.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And here.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Got it?

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
My lady.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is my favorite bracelet.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's so pretty.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How can it be so suitable?

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's so beautiful.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're a bad girl.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you, my lady.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
My lady, are you thirsty?

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How about I get you some tea and cakes?

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll count you guys.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll count you guys.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll count you guys.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll count you guys.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How do you arrange the flowers?

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's so ugly.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Who told you to arrange them like that?

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Do it again.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Plant flowers?

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What flowers?

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Just some herbs, peonies, chrysanthemums and so on.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's common.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But the number is not small.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I heard that Xiang Qiao and Yun Shuang have been working for half a day.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The whole house is full.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The size is also a jar.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let all the Jiang's house discuss it.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They say that the second lady of the Jiang's house is a mess when she comes back.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's a waste to spread the news.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's also a terrible torture.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I understand.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you ready to give the gift to the examiner?

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Come on.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Look.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
These are the best snacks of our Ji's.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Come on.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The ceremony of the ceremony is dedicated to you.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I just have some new things to talk to you.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You are especially here to thank me.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's my pleasure.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If there is no instruction from the Prime Minister of Jiang,

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I can't be satisfied with the imperial edict.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I am lucky to come to visit you.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I must thank you for taking care of me.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You are done talking.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
My husband always praises the examiner.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He is the model of the young generation in the court.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Thank you for your love.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Examiner.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This is a little gift from my husband and me.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Please accept it.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Thank you, my lady.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I will be here next month.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If you are free, you are welcome to come to the ceremony.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's my pleasure.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will leave now.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
See the examiner off.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Stop.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
My lady, should I put this here?

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes, put it there.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Put these here.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Be careful.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Slow down.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You put this there.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Put some here.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This way, please.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Examiner.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
My lady.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
My lady, Xiang Qiao is here.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Xiang Qiao.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sit.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I...

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You have worked hard today.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Sit.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Open it.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
My lady, you want to give it to me?

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Take it.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you, my lady.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is too valuable.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There will be more valuable ones in the future.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm so happy.

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you, my lady.

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Xiang Qiao.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You need to look after the flowers in the garden.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's dry and easy to catch fire.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The chrysanthemum is green.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
When you are free, pick some chrysanthemums in the yard.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Dry them and soak them in tea.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you have anything to say?

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I wanted to do this for you.

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But the hostess has a guest.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The hostess asked me to be busy for a while.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I forgot it.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What's the guest in this house?

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Everyone is so important.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's Shen Yurong, the examiner.

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
My lady, I'm not that thirsty.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The examiner you mentioned just now...

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But the man who just killed his wife...

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The examiner is a new man.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Our hostess values him.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Even the wife's wife invited him.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What?

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But his wife is so rich.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
She even hid the examiner from him.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
She even wanted to run away after he found out.

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What happened?

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She fell from the cliff.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
She deserves it.

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Poor Mr. Shen.

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He was so desperate after his wife's death.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This examiner...

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He's so heartless.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But God is so kind.

144
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
His Majesty values him so much.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He's so kind to him.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He even gave him a reward.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I heard he's getting better in front of His Majesty.

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's a blessing in disguise.

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So...

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm the one who should be blamed.

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Mr. Shen.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Xiangqiao, should we start the ceremony?

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I haven't finished yet.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's okay.

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's go. I'll send you off.

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
My lady.

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
My lady, I'm leaving.

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll tell you later.

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll go.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Sister.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Sister.

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What's wrong, sister?

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Tong.

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What he said just now.

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The witness can't be changed.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Mrs. Shen who died because of the woman.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's me.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I thought it was a normal family.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We haven't had a good meal together for a long time.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We've been busy with the ceremony.

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We're good at taking care of family matters.

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Thanks for your care.

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And thanks for your help.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Come on.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Let's have a drink.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Wish my son have a good luck and a good family.

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
A'Li.

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We're all drinking.

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why do you drink tea?

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Mother.

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm not feeling well today.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So I drink tea instead of wine.

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Then you drink it.

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't have to force you if you're not feeling well.

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Sister.

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Just give me a chance.

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Drink it.

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
My son is not a good boy.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He has no conscience.

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He's a bad boy.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We're all family.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mother, what are you talking about?

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Mother.

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm not feeling well.

195
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So I made you angry.

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Today is the day of the wedding.

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Be happy.

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're not feeling well?

199
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Excused Jiu Lin foruns.

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,400
Shen Yu Rong sent me back to my room.

201
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,480
When I wake up...

202
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,320
Who are you?

203
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,360
My lady.

204
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,560
I once suspected

205
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,080
that the Shen Family's mother framed me.

206
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,240
But I never thought

207
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,720
that Shen Yu Rong

208
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,880
knew about it.

209
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,320
I understand, my lady.

210
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,920
I understand everything.

211
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,920
I thought my lady

212
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,680
was the most miserable person in the world.

213
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,640
But my lady...

214
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,280
I was blind.

215
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,800
In the end,

216
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,560
I even got my father and my brother

217
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,720
into trouble.

218
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,160
All these are just rumors.

219
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,760
There's a saying in heaven,

220
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,200
those evil people

221
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,360
must be punished.

222
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,720
Okay.

223
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,680
Sister.

224
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,760
I'll help you.

225
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,160
I'll help you.

226
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,640
Tong.

227
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,280
Tong.

228
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,080
Since the person who framed me and Jiang Li

229
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,560
will appear in the record,

230
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,200
our plan must change.

231
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,920
How?

232
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,000
It's not enough to stand on the record.

233
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,640
Tong.

234
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,400
Do you remember

235
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,600
what Li's record is?

236
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,600
My lady.

237
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,480
There's no record.

238
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,080
Then let's give Jiang Li a record.

239
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,600
Give it back?

240
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,880
Yes.

241
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,360
Jiang Li saved me with his life.

242
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,760
This time I'll go back to the capital and the Jiang family.

243
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,160
I must give Li

244
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,240
the life he should have.

245
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,280
Jiang's wife

246
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,160
is a noble woman.

247
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,280
She deserves to stand in front of everyone in the capital.

248
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,400
She deserves praise and blessings.

249
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
So Tong.

250
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
That day's opportunity

251
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,640
is not only Jiang Ruoyou's opportunity,

252
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,840
but also Li's.

253
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
I'll make Jiang Li

254
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,080
come back to the position of Jiang's wife.

255
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
But sister.

256
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,440
It's too hard.

257
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,000
Ji Shuran will stop it.

258
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,880
For Li,

259
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,440
we must do whatever it takes.

260
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,720
If Shen Yunlong

261
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,600
sees you like this again...

262
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,880
As long as I appear in the record,

263
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,080
my identity as Jiang's wife

264
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,800
will be proven.

265
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,560
Shen Yunlong will not dare to die

266
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,760
in Jiang's house

267
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
no matter how suspicious he is.

268
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,000
Jiang Li's destiny is related to me.

269
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,240
He will help me

270
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,960
in the heaven.

271
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
Let him

272
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,640
see you

273
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,960
in the best place in the capital.

274
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,680
Be quite.

275
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,200
We have finally cut it off.

276
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,240
I've never thought

277
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,280
this silver flower

278
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,480
would look so fresh.

279
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,020
the sunlight will be easily

280
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,660
Sister Xiangqiao

281
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,100
Do you know

282
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,860
there are other places

283
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,060
where the sunlight is more sufficient?

284
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,260
Tong'er

285
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,740
You are right

286
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,500
The sunlight is sufficient

287
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,820
in Tingyue

288
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Then we put it there

289
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,340
It's just a few words

290
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,100
Nothing much

291
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,580
Or

292
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,740
the one you just took

293
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,900
which is unparalleled

294
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,140
and unique

295
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,580
Yangzhi Jade Handcuff

296
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,700
You don't want to work?

297
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,900
What are you talking about?

298
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,740
Let's go to the

299
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,300
Can you play it?

300
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,740
Play it again

301
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,700
Play the jade handcuff

302
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,380
to be elegant

303
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,260
Stop

304
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,300
What are you doing?

305
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,020
Are you trying to steal?

306
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,980
I saw Lord

307
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,180
I'm going to pay respect to him

308
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,540
Lord

309
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,660
Get out of the way

310
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,580
Lord

311
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,820
How is Li'er doing?

312
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,300
She is doing fine

313
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,100
Why are you talking so much?

314
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,340
Stay inside

315
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,860
Yes

316
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,500
She is doing fine recently

317
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,620
But she is a little angry

318
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,820
So

319
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,580
we are letting the servants

320
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,740
light the jade tea

321
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,780
I did it

322
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,420
Look

323
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,740
No wonder it's so ugly

324
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,460
You still have the nerve to say it

325
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,740
Play it again

326
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,820
Yes

327
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,560
King

328
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,680
What's wrong with you?

329
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,020
Nothing

330
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,440
Lately

331
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,060
the new emperor ascended the throne

332
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,480
There are a lot of troubles

333
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,040
It's a little bit annoying

334
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,700
I just 잘 Estex a 애

335
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,740
to bring good news

336
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,940
I doubtUE

337
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,580
At the border

338
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,120
It is doesn't matter

339
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,240
as long as you can get yourself released

340
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Sit down.

341
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,040
Father.

342
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,280
Li'er, is this the Xixilala chrysanthemum you planted?

343
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,080
Yes, father.

344
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,880
These Xixilala chrysanthemums were all planted by Li'er.

345
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,480
In the past, mother was very attentive in taking care of the flowers and plants.

346
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
Li'er learned a lot.

347
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,480
Mother often said that chrysanthemums are old and old.

348
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,280
They are very beautiful and beautiful.

349
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,080
In Hanqiu, there is a single embroidery.

350
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,480
It has a gentleman's character, just like father.

351
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,280
Li'er, I didn't expect you to remember these.

352
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,880
Where do you want to go?

353
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,080
We want to go...

354
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,480
There.

355
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,280
There.

356
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,680
I don't think we need to go there or here.

357
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,280
We actually want to go...

358
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,680
To have some convenience.

359
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,880
Yes.

360
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Tong'er also wants to go to have some convenience.

361
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,280
Is it convenient?

362
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,080
It is convenient.

363
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Let's go together.

364
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
How convenient is it?

365
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,880
Father, they went to get some snacks.

366
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,080
Father, please sit in the courtyard.

367
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,880
No, I want to go into the palace.

368
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,480
Then...

369
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,680
Father, can you bring some snacks for grandmother for Li'er?

370
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,280
That day, Li'er disturbed grandmother.

371
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,080
I felt very guilty.

372
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,480
It's not entirely your fault.

373
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,080
Forget it. It's okay to sit for a while.

374
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,280
Father, please taste the best chrysanthemum tea that I personally planted.

375
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,680
Don't hit me!

376
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,480
Li'er.

377
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,680
No, I don't dare.

378
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,280
Li'er.

379
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
I don't dare.

380
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,280
What's wrong with you?

381
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,080
Li'er.

382
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,080
Nothing...

383
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,480
Nothing.

384
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,880
Okay, okay.

385
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,680
Okay, Li'er.

386
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,680
Don't be afraid.

387
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,880
I'm a rich man.

388
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,080
I'm honest.

389
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,480
When I'm in the brothel,

390
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,280
sometimes, I can't finish my work.

391
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,280
I'll be beaten,

392
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,480
punished,

393
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,680
and then Li'er...

394
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
Let me see.

395
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,680
Yes.

396
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,080
Li'er has grown up and is a big lady.

397
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,480
But you are still my daughter.

398
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,080
How can she be so different?

399
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,480
Father.

400
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,280
I'm already home.

401
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,680
As long as you often come to my house

402
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,680
to enjoy flowers and taste tea,

403
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,280
I'll be content.

404
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,080
Li'er.

405
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,880
Just want to let you know

406
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,680
that my husband's genes these days won't leave my side at all.

407
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:39,280
I don't want to let your dad and Li'er

408
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,280
stay in the brothel with me for a long time.

409
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
http://en.wikipedia.org

410
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:54,080
I'm afraid father will think that Li'er can't see people.

411
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
This is the embroidery Li'er made for Old Madam?

412
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Do you know how Li'er lived in the Zhennv Hall?

413
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:19,080
Father, for food, he was forced to steal some evil money and exchange it for money.

414
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,080
If this matter is spread,

415
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,080
then others will laugh at our enemy's daughter who has fallen to the point where she can't eat.

416
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,080
It must be that steward's stingy money.

417
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Husband, I'll find someone to teach him a lesson.

418
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Madam,

419
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,080
you don't know that she's injured, right?

420
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Injured?

421
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
She was beaten in the Zhennv Hall.

422
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Her whole body was covered with wounds.

423
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,080
These days, I've been busy with the ceremony and neglected her.

424
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
It's my mother's fault.

425
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,080
I didn't get her heart.

426
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,080
She didn't tell me anything.

427
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Instead, she told my husband to ask him to teach me a lesson.

428
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
I owe her a lot.

429
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,080
This is the most painful thing I've heard today.

430
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,080
She's afraid that I'll think that she can't see people.

431
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,080
How could she think that?

432
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,080
This child is hiding everything from me.

433
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,080
She doesn't dare to be too close to you.

434
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,080
Since you mentioned the ceremony,

435
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
let Li'er go this time.

436
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,080
We've owed her so much for so many years.

437
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,080
This time, we can't hurt her again.

438
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,080
But Li'er has never attended any banquet.

439
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
No one taught her the rules.

440
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,080
I'm afraid that she'll be scared by the ceremony.

441
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,080
Our daughter will come out to see people sooner or later.

442
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Think about it.

443
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,080
If she gets exposed about what happened in the Hall,

444
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,080
and Ji Li erases her name,

445
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:19,560
how will we manage to get the reputation of the

446
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Madam?

447
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Stupid woman!

448
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Madam told you not to let Jiang Li see the Lord.

449
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,560
It's no use keeping you here.

450
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
I really don't know.

451
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
It's Xiangqiao.

452
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
He's greedy for money.

453
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,560
Jiang Li gave him some money.

454
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
He helped him a lot.

455
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,560
He's the one who helped him with the tea.

456
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
I really don't know.

457
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,560
If I knew, I would stop him.

458
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Xiangqiao, is that true?

459
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
Please be a good example to Madam and Madam.

460
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
I approached her just to gain her trust

461
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
and to get some information.

462
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,560
If Tong Er didn't follow me to the tea ceremony,

463
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,560
I wouldn't have done such a thing.

464
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Don't worry, Madam.

465
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
After this,

466
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Jiang Li will trust me more.

467
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,560
It's easier for Madam to do something else.

468
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Madam, this is the reward Jiang Li gave me.

469
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
I'm going to give it to Madam.

470
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Take it.

471
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Yes.

472
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,560
It's not a bad thing to gain her trust.

473
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
If there's another time,

474
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,560
I'll be more than your monthly salary.

475
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Yes.

476
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Madam,

477
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
I'm sorry.

478
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
I'm sorry.

479
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Shameless.

480
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
You think I'm shameless

481
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
and want to provoke Madam to punish me?

482
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,560
But Madam didn't punish me.

483
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Instead, she asked me to keep it

484
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
as a reward.

485
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Be careful.

486
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
If you dare to hurt me,

487
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
I'll punish you.

488
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
Listen,

489
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
if I hear you say bad things about me in front of Madam,

490
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
I won't forgive you.

491
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
You're afraid that you're guilty, right?

492
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
Don't you think I don't know

493
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
what you did in Jiang Li's room?

494
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
What did I do?

495
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
You're just jealous that I'm naughty.

496
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
How can I ask Madam and Madam to be happy?

497
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,560
But you can't.

498
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
Of course.

499
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,560
These rewards are all mine.

500
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
I...

501
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Madam.

502
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
Madam.

503
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,560
Shameless.

504
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
You...

505
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
What's wrong with me?

506
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
You're always so bitter.

507
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Who likes you?

508
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
If no one likes you,

509
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
you can take me as a concubine.

510
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
I'm bitter.

511
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Then you can be a concubine.

512
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
You...

513
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,560
You...

514
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
You're always so mean

515
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
when Madam is here.

516
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
You're calling me a dog?

517
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
Yes.

518
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Fine.

519
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
I'll bite you to death today.

520
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
No.

521
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
I'll bite you to death.

522
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
No.

523
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,560
Jiang Li has been back for days

524
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
and she hasn't come out.

525
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Is she shy

526
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
or someone doesn't let her come out?

527
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
You're so smart.

528
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Don't meddle in my business.

529
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Li likes to run around

530
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
when she was a kid.

531
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Our Rui also likes to play with her.

532
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
But she's not a girl

533
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
who can play with her 18 times.

534
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
When Li was a kid,

535
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
she was so small

536
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
and she was so chubby.

537
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Now she's so chubby.

538
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
If I met her on the street,

539
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
I might not recognize her.

540
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
If you care about your niece

541
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
so much,

542
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
you should care about your son.

543
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
The Imperial College will be destroyed soon.

544
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
What about her now?

545
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
If she's expelled from school,

546
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,560
I'll see how you'll explain to Madam.

547
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Madam.

548
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
You're always in charge of this.

549
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Why are you suddenly bringing me up?

550
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
I want to find her.

551
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
I want to take care of her.

552
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Madam, stop.

553
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
Stop.

554
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Madam.

555
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
Stop.

556
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Stop.

557
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Li is so smart.

558
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,560
The Lord must have told the technician

559
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
that he gave so many tonics

560
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
and gave them as a reward.

561
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
So pretty.

562
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
It's yours.

563
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Thank you.

564
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
It's so pretty.

565
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Sister,

566
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
there's a big monster.

567
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
You're so old.

568
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
You're afraid of a turtle?

569
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Please accept my gift.

570
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Slaughter!

571
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Jiang Jingrui

572
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,440
is the son of the enemy's brother,

573
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,560
Second Uncle, Jiang Yuanping,

574
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,560
the most handsome man in the family.

575
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,560
He is extremely domineering

576
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
with a smile on his face.

577
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
His blood is his photo.

578
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
He is called Little Rui Rui.

579
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Please accept the gift.

580
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Please be kind.

581
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,160
My dear little baby.

582
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,960
Are you okay?

583
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Did they bully you?

584
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,760
Are you okay?

585
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,760
It's okay.

586
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
Hello, Tang.

587
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,360
You are not Jiang Li.

588
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,560
What do you mean, young master?

589
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,160
What does this mean, Tang?

590
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,760
Tang?

591
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,560
You call me Tang?

592
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,360
Jiang Jingrui.

593
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,360
Xiaoruirui.

594
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,160
That's right.

595
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,960
You looked so serious just now.

596
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,760
I was so scared.

597
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,960
I was so scared.

598
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,560
Xiaoruirui is a name

599
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,160
that means you are the one.

600
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,360
Xiaoruirui is a name

601
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,160
that you gave me when I was a kid.

602
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,360
You suddenly looked serious.

603
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,960
I was so uncomfortable.

604
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,560
I thought I would never see you again.

605
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,360
You didn't even know.

606
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,760
Since you left,

607
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,360
I have been crying every day.

608
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,960
I am so sad.

609
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,360
My heart is like a knife.

610
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,360
I can only

611
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,360
live with the little baby.

612
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,560
It's good that you are kind.

613
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
I brought you back.

614
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,960
Thank you for your concern.

615
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,560
You are welcome.

616
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Sit down.

617
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,360
Sit here.

618
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,160
But

619
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,760
if you don't want to be kicked out,

620
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,160
you should be smarter.

621
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,960
Thank you for your reminder.

622
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,360
Jiang Ruoyao

623
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,560
didn't cause you any trouble, right?

624
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,760
I haven't seen him since I came back.

625
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,360
But

626
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,960
I have been away from home for a long time.

627
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,360
Why would he cause me any trouble?

628
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,960
Who told you to like Zhu Yanbang?

629
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,160
Zhu Yanbang?

630
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,960
Have you forgotten?

631
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,560
You and Zhu Yanbang have been engaged since you were young.

632
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,760
Since you were kicked out,

633
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,760
you have changed the engagement to Jiang Ruoyao.

634
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,560
Now you are back,

635
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,960
how could he not be concerned about you?

636
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
I think

637
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
we shouldn't go to the wedding.

638
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,160
Think about it.

639
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,360
You and Zhu Yanbang are impossible.

640
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
No matter how sad you are,

641
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,160
it's impossible.

642
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,960
You are in front of so many guests.

643
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,360
You are watching Zhu Yanbang and Jiang Ruoyao

644
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,160
go to the wedding.

645
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
What will you think?

646
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,360
You will be sad.

647
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,960
You will shout.

648
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,360
You are the one who is

649
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,960
bad and ugly in the wedding.

650
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,160
Duo'er, I am tired today.

651
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,760
Hurry up.

652
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,960
Send the guests out.

653
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Yes.

654
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Let's go.

655
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,160
Remember.

656
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Hurry up.

657
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,960
No need to send them out.

658
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
My lady.

659
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,560
My lady.

660
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,960
Are you going out?

661
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,960
It's my sister's wedding gift in a few days.

662
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
I will go out and pick a gift for her.

663
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
It's dirty.

664
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
It's dirty here.

665
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,560
My lady.

666
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,960
The dishes in the house

667
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,560
are all sent out today.

668
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,960
How about changing the date?

669
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Or you can write down

670
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,360
what you want to buy.

671
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
We will buy for you.

672
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Yes.

673
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
Xiangqiao.

674
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,160
Help me go to the outside.

675
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
I will go to the outside.

676
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:29,960
I will go to the outside.

677
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
Help me go to the outside to find a car.

678
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,960
Well.

679
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
I am afraid I can't find it now.

680
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
How about you wait for a few more days?

681
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
Yushuang.

682
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,560
Do you have a way to get it?

683
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,960
As long as I can get it,

684
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,960
it's not a problem to spend a lot of money.

685
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
Yushuang.

686
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,960
My lady is also worried about you.

687
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
I will go to find a car.

688
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Wait for a while.

689
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Thank you.

690
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Yushuang.

691
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,960
I have to trouble you here.

692
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
I have to go to get some rest.

693
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
Let's go.

694
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
My precious pearl.

695
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Look at you.

696
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
You can't stand still.

697
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Look.

698
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
The big carriage is ready.

699
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
How nice it is.

700
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
My lord.

701
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
My lady.

702
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
Your head.

703
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
Thank you.

704
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Xiangqiao.

705
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Today,

706
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
I need you to teach me the flowers in the yard.

707
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
You don't have to go shopping with me.

708
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
Tong.

709
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
My lady, I...

710
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,960
My lady.

711
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
My lady.

712
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Who was that?

713
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
The second lady of the family.

714
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Second lady.

715
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
That's Jiang Li.

716
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
Yes.

717
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
Third lady.

718
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
Yan Bang.

719
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
What were you looking at?

720
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,960
I heard from the servants that your sister is back.

721
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
What?

722
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
You want to see her?

723
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
I can ask her out later.

724
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
I want to see you.

725
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
I will go to see her.

726
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
I will go to see her.

727
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
I will go to see her.

728
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
I will go to see her.

729
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
I will go to see her.

730
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,960
I just asked randomly.

731
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,960
So you had a engagement before.

732
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,960
How about you cancel my engagement?

733
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
You can just cancel it.

734
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
Why are you still angry?

735
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Jiang Li has been in Zhen Nuitang for many years.

736
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
She is not good at writing and is rough.

737
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,960
How can she be better than you?

738
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Look.

739
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
I bought you your favorite pancakes.

740
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
I have arranged a long line.

741
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Let's go to school.

742
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Don't be angry.

743
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,960
Let's go.

744
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,960
Let's go.

745
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
Master.

746
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,960
You are searching the whole Mount Qingcheng with your secret guard.

747
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
It will take two days.

748
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
It's too slow.

749
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
We don't have enough people.

750
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,960
We can only transfer some of the secret guards around His Majesty.

751
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,960
Just do it.

752
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,960
I am relieved to hear that.

753
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
The second lady of the Jiang family went out.

754
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,960
She finally can't hold it anymore.

755
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Keep up.

756
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,960
Yes.

757
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Tong.

758
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
I will go in and pick a gift for Jiang Ruoyao.

759
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,960
You go to the storage room and help me pack something.

760
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
Okay.

761
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
This lady.

762
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,960
These are the famous products and expensive goods in our store.

763
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,960
You can pick one.

764
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,960
This is the treasure that the current head of the central government, Shen Xue,

765
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
gave to us.

766
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,960
It's hard to say that it's hard to ask for.

767
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,960
Shen Xue is not only good at writing,

768
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
but also good at playing the piano.

769
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
After that, she will definitely become a good official

770
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
who works for the people.

771
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Yes.

772
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
Yes.

773
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
This is a good handwriting.

774
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,960
Yes.

775
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
Look at this.

776
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Look at this.

777
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,960
This is also a rare treasure.

778
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,960
This is really a great treasure.

779
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
The second lady of the Jiang family went out.

780
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
This is also a good handwriting.

781
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
I will go to the storage room and help you.

782
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
This is the treasure that the current head of the central government, Shen Xue,

783
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,960
gave to us.

784
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
You go to the storage room and help me.

785
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
This is also a good handwriting.

786
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
This is a good handwriting.

787
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,960
This is also a good handwriting.

788
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,960
This is also a good handwriting.

789
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
Lady Shen.

790
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Lady Shen.

791
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,640
Go.

792
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Please take care.

793
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,200
Sister.

794
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,080
The feather jade pendant you asked me to take

795
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,000
was bought by someone.

796
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,920
By who?

797
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,800
Mister,

798
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,480
I've been asking for this spend forว

799
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,520
one month deep.

800
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,960
The lady left to chest chamber.

801
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,040
I wanted togest salty香.

802
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,440
Under orders,

803
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,080
I asked the manager for money in advance

804
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,040
and saw we'd get it

805
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,280
if they disappeared.

806
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,760
Who has the souvent at chest chamber?

807
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,680
The boss said it's a mistress of a family,

808
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,560
but we don't moi know actually.

809
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,120
A mistress of a family?

810
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,920
The manager is from demands government,

811
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,360
It's strange.

812
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,360
Why is he staring at our stuff?

813
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
He's not staring at our stuff.

814
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,720
He's staring at me.

815
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,960
Sister.

816
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,920
Sister.

817
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,920
Sister, don't be impulsive.

818
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,440
That's Duke Su.

819
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,720
We can't offend him.

820
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,920
Then why does the shopkeeper

821
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,040
say that

822
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,640
we're the ones who are in charge?

823
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,320
He's inviting us to go.

824
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,560
If we don't go,

825
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,200
it's stupid and rude.

826
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,240
Why do we have to retreat?

827
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,960
Besides,

828
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,240
I have to take it back.

829
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,080
Sorry, everyone.

830
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,960
I'm late.

831
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,680
Drink.

832
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,720
You must drink.

833
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,760
I will.

834
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,960
Three glasses for yourself.

835
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,000
Please wait.

836
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,520
There's someone in the room upstairs.

837
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,560
You can't go in.

838
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,560
Thank you.

839
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,560
Please tell the doctor

840
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,240
that the second lady of the Jiang family

841
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,280
is here to make an appointment.

842
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,680
I'll have dinner with you today.

843
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,280
It's okay.

844
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,720
Come on. Please sit.

845
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,760
Duke Su.

846
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,600
What can I do for you?

847
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,720
Didn't you ask Xia'er to find me?

848
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,320
Duke Su asked the shopkeeper

849
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,680
to send a message.

850
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,200
I dare not.

851
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,720
Besides, you still have

852
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,440
the jade pendant that my maid

853
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,640
wants to redeem.

854
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,120
I don't have any jade pendant.

855
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,000
The shopkeeper told me

856
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,840
that it belongs to a lady.

857
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,160
Her name is

858
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,160
A'Li.

859
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,720
Are you sure

860
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,240
it's not her?

861
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,760
Yes.

862
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,000
Your mother

863
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,520
left this when she left.

864
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,800
She said

865
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,720
she would give it to you

866
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,680
after you get married.

867
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,480
It can keep you safe and sound.

868
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,680
Since you've made up your mind,

869
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,200
take it.

870
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,480
Go.

871
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,560
Don't be embarrassed

872
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,560
to tell me

873
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,440
that you'll always be my daughter.

874
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,560
Father.

875
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,840
Lady Jiang.

876
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,640
Lady Jiang.

877
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,480
This is

878
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,280
a thing I have.

879
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,960
I can't tell you.

880
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,760
You've been in Zhennv Hall for years.

881
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,600
What do you mean?

882
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,080
Duke Su.

883
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,320
This is my private matter.

884
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,040
Okay.

885
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,560
Tell me.

886
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,040
What's the matter?

887
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,000
Tell me.

888
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,920
Why did you

889
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,560
take it as your old friend?

890
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,000
Madam.

891
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,720
Your father is too sick.

892
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,840
He needs to take it slowly.

893
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,840
He won't recover in three months.

894
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:50,800
No.

895
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,520
He'll die in a month.

896
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,440
Is there any other way?

897
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,720
The East worm is a good thing

898
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,480
to nourish the body.

899
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,760
But the price of medicine

900
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,400
is not worth it.

901
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,800
The love of yesterday

902
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,520
will last forever.

903
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,640
That's the same expression.

904
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,200
Lady Jiang.

905
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,680
What's the origin

906
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,080
of the jade pendant?

907
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,200
Duke Su is not

908
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,160
worthy of being a widow.

909
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,200
Please return the jade pendant to me.

910
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,400
Duke Su can ask for as much as he wants.

911
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,000
Do I look like I lack money?

912
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,320
What do you want?

913
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,760
I haven't asked you

914
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,120
the answer I want.

915
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,120
That day in Zhennv Hall,

916
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,560
I had no choice but to use you.

917
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,560
Please let me go.

918
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,480
Return the jade pendant to me.

919
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,400
Don't be so nervous.

920
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,640
Otherwise,

921
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,720
I'll think

922
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,360
this is the love token

923
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,440
your lover gave you.

924
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,600
I've told you.

925
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,440
I don't know him.

926
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,040
How about this?

927
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,720
Tell me.

928
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,040
Where is the love token

929
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,520
hidden?

930
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,000
If you're sure,

931
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,240
I'll return it to you.

932
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,040
What do you think?

933
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,320
I'll say it again.

934
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,320
I don't know Qin.

935
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,680
Stop playing, Zhu Jun.

936
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,440
It's more important to find the love token.

937
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,880
If you can't find it,

938
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,160
do you have other ways?

939
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,920
You want to find it,

940
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,080
but that person

941
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,480
broke into Zhennv Hall and hid it.

942
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,120
If I tell Duke Su

943
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,880
where you're looking for it,

944
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,760
will he return the jade pendant to me?

945
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,040
Tell me.

946
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,040
In Zhennv Hall's backyard.

947
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,800
How?

948
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,120
He has a mud seal.

949
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,400
There's a tree in the backyard.

950
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,560
It was windy those days.

951
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,040
A lot of fruits fell.

952
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,040
Those fruits are like mulberry.

953
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,120
It's stained with color when you touch it.

954
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,800
It's been washed for days.

955
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,960
He dug that place.

956
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,480
How do you know

957
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,760
it's not from somewhere else?

958
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,840
I've been in Zhennv Hall for ten years.

959
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,680
I know the fruits there are different from elsewhere.

960
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,640
That's a good excuse.

961
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,240
I'm telling the truth.

962
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,800
Duke Su,

963
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,200
please return the jade pendant to me.

964
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,000
Why are you in a hurry?

965
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,960
You'll know it's fake later.

966
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,880
I'm sorry.

967
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,960
I didn't mean to hurt you.

968
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,080
However...

969
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,000
Double force.

970
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:50,880
Double force.

971
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,040
Double force.

972
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,960
B kidding.

973
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,480
Who were you.

974
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,620
Mixed-Tsvis,

975
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,200
Behind the Fire.

976
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:27,940
Really?

977
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,620
Kill her.

978
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:30,840
Died of suspect trigger.

979
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,560
Are you not worried about Song my sister as V intepre you all have still lost?

980
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,440
Those who still lost our faut of art

981
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,480
will be shunned.

982
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:41,600
تي

983
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,800
Duke Su, please return the jade pendant to me.

984
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,520
I have to go home now.

985
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,760
Duke Su.

986
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,400
Duke Su, leave here now.

987
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:36,000
You never doubted the old or brand new

988
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,760
in oldルs?

989
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,480
Another day is our last.

990
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,680
This is called personal feelings.

991
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,240
Personal feelings are greater than the future of people.

992
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,400
Duke Su, what's wrong with your brain?

993
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,760
You were just

994
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,240
scolding me for being stupid?

995
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,080
Yes.

996
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,520
You're stupid.

997
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,400
How important is the female name?

998
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,840
Duke Su will know it.

999
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,280
I was intruded into the place where I was born.

1000
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,400
The intruder became a lover.

1001
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,920
I became a father.

1002
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,880
I was humiliated by your filial piety.

1003
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,040
What's more terrible is

1004
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,960
I was beaten up by my son

1005
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,920
and my bones were broken.

1006
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,200
Do you want to kill me?

1007
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,920
I can't prove my innocence.

1008
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,480
If Duke Su thinks

1009
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,080
that your criminal and I have personal feelings,

1010
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,760
why don't you go to the Jiang family

1011
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,480
and lock me up?

1012
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,880
What's wrong with your eyes?

1013
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:11,840
What?

1014
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,040
Do you think there's something wrong with our eyes?

1015
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,080
Go back to take the military officer.

1016
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,640
Why?

1017
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,280
Your eyes are dirty.

1018
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,200
Do you think I went too far just now?

1019
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,520
I dare not.

1020
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,040
There's nothing you dare not do.

1021
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,080
I also think I'm shameless.

1022
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,560
But I'm not shameless.

1023
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,720
I can't force her to be true.

1024
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,720
Do you want me to send someone to follow you?

1025
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,200
No need.

1026
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:46,640
If there's no happy memory,

1027
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:54,640
how can I go through the sad bottom?

1028
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:02,360
Two cold and heartless people

1029
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,280
holding hands

1030
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:09,360
Can we go through the snowy season?

1031
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:17,560
In the cold wind, in the long night

1032
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:24,560
Embracing the warmth of the remains

1033
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:32,840
The sea is deep, not firm

1034
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:39,560
Can we bury the regret from yesterday?

1035
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:46,160
Love is to cherish with life

1036
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:54,600
Live on, even if it's a little hurt

1037
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,800
No matter sorrow or joy

1038
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,520
I believe you

1039
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:09,200
I'd rather be trapped in the coldness of the world

1040
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:16,800
Live on, gather all the courage

1041
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:24,600
Love on, until you breathe

1042
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,760
Go through the Purgatory of Rebirth

1043
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,840
Just to get you

1044
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:37,600
Get back together and never be far from

1045
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:46,160
Get back together and never be far from
