1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I will never give up.

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Then I will not give up.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Slowly, I will endure the pain of life.

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
After going through the cold winter, I still feel the same.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Waiting for the spring to return again.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will not give up.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Waiting for the spring to return again.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The Legend of Chusen

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
When a person is in a crisis,

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
he is like falling leaves.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
His fate is drifting.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He can't have himself.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The Prime Minister's Manor can't tolerate this kind of falling leaves.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But A'Li, you...

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
will have a long life.

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Master, the breakfast is ready in the hall.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Second Lady Jiang, please.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The Palace of the Sun

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Where is Situ?

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She left.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
She didn't leave any living people in the yard.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Then...

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You slept so much.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It doesn't count.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hurry and eat.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Father, the fried food is ready.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Be careful.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's so hot.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Are you okay?

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Enough, enough.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Stop it. The porridge is almost cold.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Enough, enough.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come and eat.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Hurry and eat.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Your porridge is getting cold.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What?

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I treated you to a meal.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you moved and crying?

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm not crying.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You can't eat or talk.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Father.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you, thank you.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're welcome.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you, thank you.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Father, I'm sorry.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Father.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It smells so good.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Do you want to eat?

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll eat this.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Try this bun.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Try this bun.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This morning, the people in the mansion

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
went out to buy it.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's specially...

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Duke Su.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You don't eat or talk.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You don't talk or talk.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Second Madam Jiang.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You came so late.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I thought you wouldn't dare to come.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How could I?

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I put the bet on my heart.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's good.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mr. Li.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Mr. Li.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Mr. Li.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Mr. Li.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Each of you put 20 disappearances of special south magical miss 묻

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
All our political news is going to start this year.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,420
Which means,

72
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,420
for your own mixed feelings,

73
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,420
I've prepared it

74
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,420
As usual

75
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,420
The last pair will leave Mingyi Hall and the Imperial College

76
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,420
Good luck to you all

77
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,420
His Majesty will personally give the imperial college's student certificate

78
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:34,420

Jiang Li, Jiang Li

81
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,420
What are you thinking?

82
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,420
It's started

83
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,420
Student Shen, can we start?

84
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,420
Let's start

85
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,420
The first test begins

86
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,420
The first test begins

87
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,420
Duke Su, the days you asked

88
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,420
The ones who are on the stage are all Little Taohong

89
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
What's behind?

90
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,420
Little Sun Tu from Boss Xiao

91
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
Pipa Ji from Boss Zhang

92
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,420
And Little Taohong's old case

93
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
I got it

94
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,420
Go down

95
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
Ok

96
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,420
Chu Jun, you can't bear to leave Little Taohong

97
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,420
Check this woman

98
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,420
Don't alert her

99
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,420
Although money has no legs

100
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,420
It's faster to keep it than anyone else

101
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
Check it

102
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,420
Tighten the belt

103
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,420
Yes

104
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,420
Stop

105
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,420
Why are you in a hurry?

106
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,420
She's going to the gambling house

107
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,420
Why are you talking about everything?

108
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,420
What are you talking about?

109
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
Today is the day of the broken city

110
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,420
The gambling factory in the city set up a bet for Jiang Li and her

111
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,420
Everyone is gambling

112
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
You bet

113
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
I bet earlier

114
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
Who doesn't bet if they have money?

115
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,420
Li Lian will definitely win

116
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,420
Chu Jun has such a big hand today

117
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,420
Today Little Taohong can't touch

118
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,420
Touch the second lady Jiang

119
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
The last one

120
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,420
The final match is

121
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,420
Yan Shijie

122
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,420
It's up to you

123
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,420

124
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420

130
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,420

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
Correct

Bei Zhou is a generation

145
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
It's not uncommon

146
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Yin is in the Yang family

147
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,420

When you are well-prepared, you are more prone to being careless

153
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,420
When you are well-prepared, you are more prone to being careless

154
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,420
You are secretly hiding in the public

He likes to be punished later

160
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,420

Yan Shijie, one point

174
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,420
Each one gets one point

Oh no, I didn't expect Li Jin to be so good

179
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,420
The next question is a serious question

180
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,420
Li Jin has been by Prime Minister Li's side since he was a child

181
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
He is like a wooden person

182

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,420
The final serious question is judged by Shen Xue Shi

184
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,420
Shen Xue Shi, please

185
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,420
This question is a question that His Majesty and I have asked together

186
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,420
The new emperor ascended the throne, and the treasury was empty

187
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:15,580
There is a worry of corruption and

188
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,580
Li Jin, what do you think?

189
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,580
I think that solving the disaster needs to be very precise

190
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
The corrupt officials can't move first

191
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,580
In order to ensure the lower level of disaster relief

192
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,580
Although those who help the wall can't stay long

193
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,580
But at present they are the main forces to transport and deliver food

194
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,580
Otherwise, the disaster is not handled well and the people's hearts are lost

195
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,580
Then His Majesty's position is even more vulnerable

196
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,580
What Mr. Li said seems reasonable

197
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,580
But in fact it is a way of winning

198
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,580
Even if this method solves the problem of the disaster

199
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,580
It is also impossible to hold on

200
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,580
Since these corrupt officials have tasted the sweet

201
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,580
It is impossible to let go

202
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
Will definitely cause a disaster

203
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,580
Only because of human nature

204
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,580
In the end, the emperor's disaster is two-headed

205
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,580
Only the corrupt officials' power is the only one

206
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,580
Mr. Ye, the view is really good

207
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,580
But it's just a building in the air

208
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,580
I'm afraid it's not going to happen at all

209
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,580
If you want to pursue the clear water, Mr. Ye

210
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,580
Mr. Ye, the clear water is the best

211
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,580
Everyone can think of the big picture

212
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,580
But the real work is much more complicated than just talking about the soldiers

213
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,580
It's really a young man from the country

214
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,580
He is more intelligent when he sees the problem

215
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,580
Ye Shijie has no practical experience at all

216
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,580
I agree

217
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,580
Oh, no

218
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
Why do I feel like Ye Shijie is going to lose

219
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,580
No

220
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,580
Ye Shijie is going to win

221
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,580
Why?

222
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,580
Why did the emperor reward you with so many things?

223
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,580
The emperor asked me today

224
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,580
Under the disaster, the corrupt officials are not afraid of the clear water

225
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,580
Then what does this have to do with the reward?

226
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,580
I said that in childhood

227
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,580
I saw my father killed for the corrupt officials' power

228
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,580
Causing the family to be destroyed

229
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,580
The corrupt officials are in the country

230
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,580
The national treasury is empty

231
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,580
The national treasury is empty

232
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,580
Then there is no food and drink

233
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,580
If there is no food and drink, then the people will be ruined

234
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,580
How can I go because of the clear water

235
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,580
I'd rather be an isolated official

236
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,580
Mr. Li

237
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,580
The country's financial disaster is not only the reputation of the people

238
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,580
It's also the dignity of the emperor

239
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,580
If the subject is not changed for a while

240
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,580
Let go of corruption

241
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,580
Then there are thousands of people dying under the sky

242
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:40,860
This official position is like a school's

243
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,580
The night is the victory

244
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,580
Ye Shijie is five points

245
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,580
Ye Shijie, Li Jin, ranked first

246
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,580
Mr. Ye's performance today is really wonderful

247
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,580
Mr. Li's performance is also unique

248
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,580
Then continue to look forward to the performance of the team

249
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,580
I invite everyone to dinner today

250
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,580
Let's have a good meal

251
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,580
Celebrate Ye Shijie's victory

252
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,580
I have never seen such a careful understanding

253
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,580
It seems that the Li brothers are Dongzhen Pavilion

254
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,580
I wanted to win the first prize to give everyone confidence

255
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,580
I didn't expect to play it to the end

256
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,580
I'm sorry

257
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
I'm sorry

258
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
I'm sorry

259
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
I'm sorry

260
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
I'm sorry

261
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,580
I'm sorry

262
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,580
I'm sorry

263
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
I'm sorry

264
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
I'm sorry

265
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
I'm sorry

266
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,580
I'm sorry

267
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
I'm sorry

268
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
I'm sorry

269
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
I'm sorry

270
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,580
You two are fighting on the same level

271
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
I was still proud of you before

272
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
I should apologize to you

273
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
Mr. Ye

274
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,580
It's not easy to get the first prize

275
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,580
Next, it's up to you

276
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,580
Jiang Jingrui, can you wake up

277
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,580
Remove the bruise

278
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,580
My chess skill doesn't count as the first prize

279
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,580
But I won't touch anyone

280
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,580
You'll tell me when you win

281
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,580
I'm waiting for you

282
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
Give me your hand

283
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,580
What are you doing

284
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,140
I just want to get lucky.

285
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,020
Come on, Liu Xun.

286
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,460
Why are you holding my hand?

287
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,500
Can't I get lucky?

288
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,100
Fine.

289
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,420
Everyone, come on.

290
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,900
Mr. Ye.

291
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,500
Your hand.

292
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,020
What are you doing?

293
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,580
I just want to get lucky.

294
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,300
Although Mr. Ye doesn't believe me,

295
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,020
don't be so sad.

296
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,140
Fine.

297
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,100
He'll give you all the good luck.

298
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,220
Get up.

299
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,500
Together.

300
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,380
Together.

301
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,180
Then please don't meet Li Lian in the first round.

302
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,060
And please get a high score.

303
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,620
Come on.

304
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,100
Okay.

305
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,500
One, two, three.

306
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,460
We'll win.

307
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,020
What's Shen Yurong?

308
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:49,500
Isn't he just being

309
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,460
spoiled by His Majesty?

310
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,380
How dare he teach your brother a lesson?

311
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,620
I think in the capital,

312
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,780
I think he doesn't want to stay in the capital.

313
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,860
Shen Yurong,

314
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,740
you can't move.

315
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,460
Think about it.

316
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,260
He's from Hanwen.

317
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,380
He's not a good person.

318
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
He's not a good person.

319
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,380
He's not a good person.

320
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,380
He's not a good person.

321
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,660
He's from Hanwen.

322
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,540
He's not like the Li's.

323
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,620
Who can be the official?

324
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,260
He's the only one who's a good person.

325
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,780
But he's very stable.

326
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,220
He even got into His Majesty's eyes easily.

327
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,900
Why?

328
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,140
Don't you think it's strange?

329
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,420
No, brother.

330
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,420
Who's behind him?

331
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,860
Even if we have to move,

332
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,860
it's not our turn to move.

333
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,340
The most important thing for me

334
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,980
is to win the world.

335
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,980
You must be the first one

336
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,700
to take the chess.

337
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,740
Don't worry.

338
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,300
I've made the call.

339
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,500
No one dares to win me at this time.

340
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,860
Jiang Li

341
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,900
is not far from Zhenning Hall.

342
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,020
Brother.

343
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,020
Brother.

344
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,540
I didn't understand the game of chess.

345
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,660
Can you help me again?

346
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
Go to your sister-in-law.

347
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,180
Sister-in-law?

348
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,380
Brother.

349
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,980
Are you okay?

350
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,180
I still have something to do.

351
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,180
We'll talk later.

352
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,180
How could I remember her?

353
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,780
How could I forget her?

354
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,180
How could I remember her?

355
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,940
The night of Mount Qingcheng,

356
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,980
the coldness of the bones,

357
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,740
coldness can make people see through everything.

358
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,180
Why did my beloved family

359
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,220
send me to Mount Qingcheng

360
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,580
for ten years

361
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,980
with such a heart?

362
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,380
The End

363
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,060
You lost.

364
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,860
I told you it's okay.

365
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,660
Such a good chess skill is not bad.

366
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,140
You lost to me on purpose.

367
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,740
You were playing a guided chess.

368
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,580
It seems that I won.

369
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,260
But in fact,

370
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,020
you are in charge of the game.

371
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,660
You are the one who should win.

372
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,700
You can see my intention.

373
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,820
It means your chess skill is good.

374
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,900
Of course.

375
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,820
My father's chess book

376
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,580
is not 180 times.

377
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,540
It's definitely a reading and a variation.

378
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,140
Your style of chess is similar to mine.

379
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,220
But your

380
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,020
unyielding thinking

381
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,860
gives me a new insight.

382
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,020
By the way,

383
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,860
who did you learn your chess skill from?

384
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,140
I was also watching chess

385
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,620
in Zhennv Hall.

386
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,060
So,

387
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,900
you are the same as me.

388
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,780
I heard that there are many good players in the Imperial College.

389
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,420
Have you played against them?

390
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,860
I don't need to play against them.

391
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,700
I know it.

392
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,300
The Imperial College plays chess

393
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,300
because of the human emotions.

394
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,940
Li Lian can get the first place.

395
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,540
It means that the one who plays against him

396
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,860
will not dare to beat him.

397
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,260
Then you will teach them a lesson

398
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,740
when you meet them next time.

399
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,580
Of course.

400
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,660
Ding Liangzhu.

401
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,660
I explained it.

402
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,020
He is very smart.

403
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,100
Since he has no idea

404
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,460
what's going on,

405
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,460
he is getting closer and closer to me.

406
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,820
If that man really wants

407
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,980
my place,

408
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,780
I should understand that he doesn't want it.

409
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,100
It's not a good time.

410
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,900
It vaccines my teeth.

411
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,700
You have already solved the case.

412
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,740
But now you just wake the truth.

413
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,820
Linanting,

414
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,140
I think that

415
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,060
you have learned a lot on chess this year.

416
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,580
And you will not have to be7 cheers or fingerprints on the ground.

417
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,900
I'm just a peasant

418
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,660
Please help me

419
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,900
Fairy Jin Hong

420
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,700
She's not an ordinary person

421
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,980
She's the top of the court of the Immortal Tower

422
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,180
And she's also one of the judges of this exam

423
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,140
Yesterday's competition was really wonderful

424
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,180
I wonder how the chess will be today

425
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,020
The one who participates in the competition will draw a lot of money

426
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,740
The one who loses will be eliminated

427
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,420
The winner will be promoted

428
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,980
Why is it not Shen Xue Shi today?

429
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,980
Isn't Shen Ruo Yun her sister?

430
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,460
I guess she won't participate in the competition

431
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,820
just to avoid the penalty

432
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,740
Tao Cheng versus Liu Lingzi

433
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,340
Give me a book

434
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,260
It hurts

435
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,820
Can you not say it in your heart?

436
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,100
If I don't say it, how can God hear it?

437
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,460
Li Lian versus

438
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,140
No, it's not me

439
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,060
Zeng Qi

440
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,820
I'm screwed

441
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,140
Jiang Jingrui versus

442
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,620
It's me

443
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,100
Shen Ruo Yun

444
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,580
Why do you always win?

445
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,580
I'm not going to play

446
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,100
Mom, I'm not going to learn chess anymore

447
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,820
Why are you making her angry again?

448
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,500
Yun'er is your little sister-in-law

449
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,220
Can't you just let her have a little bit of it?

450
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,620
Jiang Jingrui

451
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,700
Don't leave any love for her

452
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,780
You scared me

453
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,700
Kill her, you can't lie to me

454
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,020
Jiang Jingrui, you can lose if you don't want to play

455
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,620
You can't win anyway

456
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,740
I think you should think about it

457
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,780
You'll cry later

458
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,900
Ridiculous

459
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,580
Start

460
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,940
It's a pity to keep it

461
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,060
Let's go

462
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,580
What is going on in here?

463
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,940
It's not interesting

464
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,580
Skin's gone

465
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,100
The pawn'sla tease

466
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,420
It seems to be a serious injury.

467
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,340
He did it on purpose.

468
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,620
He's trying to lure the enemy into the trap.

469
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,540
Really?

470
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,420
The stronger you attack,

471
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,420
the more flaws you'll have.

472
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,420
Next, it's my turn.

473
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,020
Yun, you should play more carefully.

474
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,820
The stronger you attack, the more flaws you'll have.

475
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,220
Next, it's my turn.

476
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,820
I thought Zhang Jingrui was just a nobody.

477
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,220
I didn't expect that from the beginning,

478
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,020
he's been playing for this one trick.

479
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,420
He's always humiliated in front of the enemy.

480
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,420
He's always retreating.

481
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,620
Under the pretext of not getting angry at the enemy,

482
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,820
he's already bitten the dead flag in front of him.

483
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,420
He's become a chess piece.

484
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,620
Get off here.

485
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,820
You can walk here.

486
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,420
You should remember the formation of the game.

487
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,420
You must have been bitten by a dead flag.

488
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,020
Did I eat a dead flag?

489
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,420
If you keep playing here,

490
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,620
our game will be over.

491
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,820
That's boring.

492
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Get off here.

493
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,220
Mr. Xiao, he keeps bothering me.

494
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,020
Stop making a scene.

495
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,620
The way Jiang Jingrui plays is not to win the opponent directly.

496
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,020
It's to let the opponent see hope and guide him.

497
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,020
In private, it's a kind of guide to teach the opponent how to play.

498
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,620
But in the game,

499
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,220
it's the most boring and cruel way.

500
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,820
Ru Yun, don't give up yet.

501
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,620
I hope you can attack me from the other side.

502
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,820
Why is it always you?

503
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,620
What's wrong?

504
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,820
Do you want to catch me first?

505
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,220
Do it.

506
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,820
Do it.

507
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,820
Do it.

508
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,820
Do it.

509
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,820
Do it.

510
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,820
Do it.

511
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,820
Do it.

512
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,820
Do it.

513
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,820
Do it.

514
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,820
Do it.

515
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,820
Do it.

516
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,820
Do it.

517
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,820
Me?

518
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,820
Me?

519
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,820
What's wrong?

520
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,820
Are you okay?

521
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,820
Congratulations.

522
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,820
I'll treat you to a meal today.

523
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,820
You didn't even get the first place.

524
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,820
You're so arrogant after you died in the fifth place.

525
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,820
What do you mean?

526
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,820
I won so many games

527
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,820
and got such a high ranking.

528
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,820
I should be praised.

529
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,820
Don't be sad.

530
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,820
Don't be nervous.

531
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,820
I'll give you all my good luck.

532
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,820
I wish you a good luck tomorrow.

533
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,820
What's wrong?

534
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,820
Liu Xun.

535
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,820
How's your old injury?

536
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,820
Don't worry. I'm fine.

537
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,820
I'll get up from where I fell.

538
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,820
Thank you for taking care of my business.

539
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,820
I'll give you a gift today.

540
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,820
Thank you.

541
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,820
Here.

542
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,820
What's this?

543
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:38,820
TIP 너은 tempt

544
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,820
TIP 너은

545
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,820
Brother,

546
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,820
I was so scared.

547
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,820
Jiang Li is Xue Fang Fei.

548
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Don't talk nonsense.

549
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,820
How can there be such a person in this world?

550
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,820
I've heard enough of this.

551
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,820
Don't mention it again.

552
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,820
When I played chess today,

553
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,820
I felt like I was playing chess with Xue Fang Fei.

554
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,820
Stop talking.

555
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
I felt so familiar.

556
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,820
Xue Fang Fei definitely didn't die.

557
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,820
Do you think Jiang Li was killed by Xue Fang Fei?

558
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,820
I told you to stop talking!

559
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,820
I used these hands to bury her.

560
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,820
Jiang Li is Jiang Li.

561
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,820
No matter how you frame her, it can't be Xue Fang Fei!

562
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,820
You know you're scared now.

563
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,820
When you and mom received the gift of Wan Ning

564
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,820
and framed her,

565
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,820
weren't you happy?

566
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,820
The situation has been decided.

567
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,820
You're afraid of seeing ghosts.

568
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,820
Mom forced me to do it.

569
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,820
I don't want to do this either.

570
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,820
If I don't obey mom,

571
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,820
mom will force me to die.

572
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,820
Don't make me see your guilty face again.

573
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,820
Listen.

574
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,820
I'm telling you.

575
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,820
Xue Fang Fei is dead.

576
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,820
Dead!

577
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,820
She died in the mountain of Qingcheng.

578
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,820
Do you remember?

579
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,820
I remember.

580
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,820
Louder!

581
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,820
I remember.

582
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,820
Get lost!

583
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,820
Mom!

584
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,820
Mom!

585
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,820
After the following day,

586
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,820
I won the money I paid.

587
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,820
Don't be so shy.

588
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
The one who sees it will get a share.

589
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,820
When I get the money,

590
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,820
I'll treat you to a big meal.

591
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,820
I don't think so.

592
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,820
Master, what do you think?

593
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,820
You're waiting for me to reward you with wine.

594
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,820
No, Master.

595
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,820
Don't blame me for being talkative.

596
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,820
Why are you betting on Jiang Li?

597
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,820
She can't win.

598
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,820
Ye Shijie and the Li family won the game.

599
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,820
Ye Shijie and the Li family won the game.

600
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,820
Actually, Li Lian won the first place.

601
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,820
Jiang Jingrui only took the fifth place.

602
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,820
Liu Xu and Jiang Li

603
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,820
are both the top three

604
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,820
in Meng Hongjing's exam.

605
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,820
Even if Liu Xu won Meng Hongjing,

606
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,820
it's just a gap

607
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,820
between Jiang Jingrui and him.

608
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,820
In the last round of the piano competition,

609
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,820
Jiang Li must win the first place.

610
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,820
Wang Qingqing is in the Li family's team.

611
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,820
She's been a teacher for many years.

612
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,820
How can Jiang Li beat her?

613
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,820
Even if Jiang Li beat Wang Qingqing,

614
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,820
don't forget that

615
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,820
she's the best in the world.

616
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,820
That means she must win

617
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,820
the first place in the piano competition

618
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,820
for several years in a row.

619
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,820
The second lady of the Jiang family

620
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,820
is going back to Zhennv Hall.

621
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,820
Go and see how she's doing.

622
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,820
Yes.

623
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,820
I'll go.

624
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,820
Why is she in the water?

625
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,820
Why is she in the water?

626
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,820
She's not in the water.

627
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,820
She's not in the water.

628
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,820
She's not in the water.

629
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,820
She's not in the water.

630
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,820
She's not in the water.

631
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,820
She's not in the water.

632
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,820
She's not in the water.

633
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
She's not in the water.

634
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,820
She's not in the water.

635
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,820
She's not in the water.

636
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
She's not in the water.

637
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,820
She's not in the water.

638
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,820
She's not in the water.

639
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,820
She's not in the water.

640
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,820
She's not in the water.

641
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,820
She's not in the water.

642
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
She's not in the water.

643
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,820
She's not in the water.

644
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,820
She's not in the water.

645
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,820
She's not in the water.

646
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,820
She's not in the water.

647
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,820
She's not in the water.

648
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,820
She's not in the water.

649
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,380
Huaiaun

650
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:48,560
Oh my,

651
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,180
we have our granddaughter's death.

652
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,500
Our career is ruined.

653
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,260
Where's she?

654
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,460
Perturbed by forever.

655
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:07,960

Part 1

658
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,520
In the shooting competition this time,

659
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,620
the shot created by the former emperor

660
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,280
will be examined.

661
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,940
What's the의着天功术?

662
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,460
They are the number of balls

663
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,860
The more shots the ball is hit, the higher the score.

664
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,180
They were always prepared by the shooting.

665
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,780
Why did they change the form?

666
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,180
The shooting game is always changed.

667
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,900
Shoot the ball, shoot the ball.

668
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,140
One is riding the shot,

669
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,660
the other is running the shot.

670
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,660
Now we consider that we are a team game.

671
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,140
So we are shooting with the ball.

672
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,900
We can't change the medicine.

673
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,660
The first group, Zhou Yan Bang, Zhu Ge Pei.

674
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,300
The players are ready.

675
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,300
Zhou Yan Bang will win.

676
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,020
Zhou Yan Bang will win.

677
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,700
Zhou Yan Bang will win.

678
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,420
Zhou Yan Bang will win.

679
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,420
Zhou Yan Bang will win.

680
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,900
The game starts.

681
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,540
Are your hands okay?

682
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,020
No problem.

683
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,860
Are you scared?

684
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,620
Are you nervous?

685
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,180
Shut up.

686
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,340
Chen Zhu, calm down.

687
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,060
Be confident.

688
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,260
I told you to shut up.

689
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,500
Liu Qu, you are the best.

690
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Jiang Jingrui, you can die if you don't talk.

691
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,460
You guys are up next.

692
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,940
The first round of assessment begins.

693
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,100
Get ready.

694
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,100
Set off.

695
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,060
Go!

696
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,980
Zhou Yanzheng will win! Zhou Yanzheng will win!

697
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,620
Zhou Yanzheng will win! Zhou Yanzheng will win!

698
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,220
Zhou Yanzheng will win! Zhou Yanzheng will win!

699
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,300
It's time for the next round.

700
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,540
High-five up!

701
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,580
Okay.

702
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,460
b

703
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,320
will conspire to defeat Lin Hao.

704
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,000
Don't worry, young master Zou,

705
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,120
just let them...

706
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,620
Lord King!

707
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,020
Lord King!

708
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,280
Don't be nervous!

709
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,000
You've worked hard!

710
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,560
Much to our face.

711
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,560
Nothing to be nervous about.

712
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,120
Tell me about your aggrostness.

713
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,220
Which maybe

714
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,880
can be eliminated by me.

715
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,160
Here is our result.

716
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,560
Let's share it.

717
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:44,180
Wang Hongqing! Wang Hongqing! Wang Hongqing!

718
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,980
Liu Xu, I didn't expect you to come to the competition.

719
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,580
If you fall again,

720
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,980
your paw will be broken.

721
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,380
Is it worth it for the big talk of this country girl?

722
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,780
Mind your own business.

723
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,380
Contestants, get ready!

724
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,380
Ready!

725
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,780
Go!

726
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,780
Ready!

727
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:57,380
Wang Hongqing! Wang Hongqing!

728
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
Liu Xu, are you okay?

729
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,980
I'm fine.

730
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,780
Liu Xu is usually fierce.

731
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,380
What's going on today?

732
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,780
He may have a hypothermia.

733
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,780
Hypothermia?

734
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,780
Yes.

735
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,780
As long as his feet are on the ground, he will feel dizzy.

736
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,980
Then let's pull it lower.

737
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,180
It's useless.

738
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,780
As long as he is hanging in the air, he will feel dizzy and dizzy.

739
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,780
How do you know?

740
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,980
In my childhood, I was good at both civil and martial arts.

741
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,180
But I found that I couldn't practice in the Qing palace.

742
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,580
Pull it higher!

743
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,980
Release!

744
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,380
Release!

745
00:39:52,580 --> 00:40:00,580
Wang Hongqing! Wang Hongqing!

746
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,180
Liu Xu, you can't give up so early.

747
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,380
Don't be a disgrace here.

748
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,780
Release!

749
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,180
Xiaolv, I haven't lost yet.

750
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,780
It's not the time to say sorry.

751
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,780
Who said I was going to say sorry?

752
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,580
I mean, you pull it higher!

753
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,380
Aren't you afraid?

754
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,780
Of course I'm afraid.

755
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,580
But I want to win!

756
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,580
We believe you!

757
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,380
We believe you!

758
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,380
Come on!

759
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,380
I haven't seen Red Fairy since yesterday.

760
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,580
What if he's still inside?

761
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,980
I think the stone leaf top becomes disappearing.

762
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,180
Do you know that?

763
00:40:46,580 --> 00:41:01,560
He went to the other room with

764
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,180
strange pig trotter as it was.

765
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:13,020
Liu Xie!

766
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,620
Wang Hongjie!

767
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:29,500
Liu Xie!

768
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,460
Ready!

769
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,940
Pop!

770
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,860
Yes.

771
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,980
You think

772
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,880
I dare anime her?

773
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,240
You do Anime.

774
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,480
But not a arms race.

775
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,640
Why do you have the courage,

776
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,000
because you're not willing to die,

777
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,860
Mr. Guo...

778
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,020
Be careful.

779
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,700
Let's go!

780
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,100
gibta

781
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:10,040
the fairy weiß

782
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:30,720
fairy

783
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,160
Liu Xun! Liu Xun! Liu Xun!

784
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,280
Liu Xun! Liu Xun! Liu Xun!

785
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,760
Let's go! Let's go!

786
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,440
I'm leaving, too.

787
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,280
Liu Xun! Liu Xun!

788
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,680
Liu Xun! Liu Xun!

789
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,680
Liu Xun! Liu Xun!

790
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,680
Liu Xun! Liu Xun!

791
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,080
Liu Xun!

792
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,640
Mr. Shen! Mr. Xiao!

793
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,280
I'm hurt! I'm hurt!

794
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,560
Where are you hurt?

795
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,360
My butt is hurt!

796
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,720
Someone's secret weapon

797
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,880
shot my butt!

798
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,720
Why did it shoot your...

799
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,720
Liu Xun! Liu Xun!

800
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,560
...butt?

801
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,840
I don't want to!

802
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,800
It's my fault!

803
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,840
I'm the one who got shot!

804
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,920
I'm the one who got shot!

805
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,440
Liu Xun! Liu Xun!

806
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,240
Where's the secret weapon?

807
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,360
Here!

808
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,080
Liu Xun! Liu Xun!

809
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,360
Liu Xun! Liu Xun!

810
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,520
Blood!

811
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,360
Liu Xun! Liu Xun!

812
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,960
My butt!

813
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,360
Liu Xun! Liu Xun!

814
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,400
What's going on?

815
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,120
What's going on?

816
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:58,920
Why is he so close?

817
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,920
The team that won the competition

818
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,800
is even worse than the team that lost.

819
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,400
They still lost one more place.

820
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,120
The daughter of Mr. Li's team's

821
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,840
chief assistant, Wang Qingqing,

822
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,360
was the second place in last year's chess competition.

823
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,680
The first place is Jiang Ruoyao.

824
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,920
That means

825
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,880
Jiang Ruoyao will win the first place.

826
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,960
That's right.

827
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,960
It seems that

828
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,160
a great show of the same age

829
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,600
is about to begin.

830
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,920
The bet between Jiang Li and He Heyangyang

831
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,040
has become a hot topic in the city.

832
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,560
I wonder if my niece Ruoyao

833
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,320
can achieve good results this time.

834
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,760
Consort Li, please rest assured.

835
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,000
Ruoyao is my favorite student.

836
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,080
Her music is always famous.

837
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,280
I think

838
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,720
this time, she will be able to

839
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,000
win the first place.

840
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,240
I think so.

841
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,320
I think so.

842
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,400
I think so.

843
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,480
I think so.

844
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,560
I think so.

845
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,640
I think so.

846
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,720
I think so.

847
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,800
I think so.

848
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,720
There shouldn't be any problem

849
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,160
if she wins the first place this time.

850
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,560
I just don't know

851
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,840
if there will be a show of the same age in the school.

852
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,000
In terms of skills,

853
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,680
I don't think

854
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,200
she can compete with Ruoyao.

855
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
Little Head, have some tea.

856
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,040
Let's go.

857
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,640
Slowly.

858
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,560
Tomorrow's competition,

859
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,400
is Sister Ruoyao ready?

860
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,200
Jiang Li will win the competition tomorrow.

861
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,240
Our team will win the bet.

862
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,240
We are family

863
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,240
You should be more flexible

864
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,240
I don't want to do my best

865
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,240
It will make me look disrespectful

866
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,240
Jiang Li

867
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,240
Are you sure about tomorrow?

868
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,240
I'm sorry

869
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,240
I'm sorry

870
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,240
I'm sorry

871
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,240
Jiang Jinrui

872
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,240
You go back first

873
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,240
I want to take a walk and have a walk

874
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,240
Then you pass by the rice cake shop

875
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,240
Remember to bring me rice cake

876
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,240
Ok

877
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,240
Then I go back first

878
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,240
What do you want from me?

879
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,240
Burn it

880
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,240
You are the first person

881
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,240
who can't even cure Si Tu Jiu Yue

882
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,240
I have been practicing for a few days

883
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,240
You are in a hurry to make a contribution

884
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,240
Li

885
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,240
You still haven't grown up

886
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,240
after the last time

887
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,240
It seems that you don't want to win tomorrow

888
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,240
Today

889
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,240
I will have a good rest

890
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,240
Please let go of me

891
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,240
Let me go back

892
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,240
It's not shameful to owe me a favor

893
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,240
Please give me a signal

894
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,240
Send a message to Si Tu Jiu Yue

895
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,240
Her reputation is ruined by this girl

896
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,240
Let's go

897
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,240
Yes, Master

898
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,240
Xiao Heng

899
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,240
Why is my reputation ruined?

900
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,240
Why is it you again?

901
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,240
You owe her in your last life

902
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,240
Let's see

903
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,240
You can't even hold on to the light of two days

904
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,240
What are you doing?

905
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,240
After the treatment

906
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,240
I can't feel the pain

907
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,240
I can't feel the pain

908
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,240
I can't feel the pain

909
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,240
I can't feel the pain

910
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,240
I thought I was fine

911
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,240
I couldn't hold it in yesterday

912
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,240
so I tried to lie to you

913
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,240
You want to win so badly

914
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,240
Please save me

915
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,240
Your hand

916
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,240
is damaged

917
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,240
If you want to recover

918
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,240
at least three days

919
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,240
Only one day

920
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,240
Then you should be more clever

921
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,240
There is also a disease

922
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,240
that the best doctor in the world can't cure

923
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,240
Look

924
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,240
You scared her away

925
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,240
It's the best gambler

926
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,240
Xiao Heng

927
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,240
If you insist on treating her

928
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,240
there is still a way

929
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,240
But if you can't hold it

930
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,240
she will die

931
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,240
Do you dare to hide?

932
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,240
I disobeyed the doctor

933
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,240
so I ended up like this

934
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,240
I'm willing to fight

935
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,240
for anything useful

936
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

937
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

938
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

939
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

940
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

941
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

942
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

943
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

944
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

945
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

946
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

947
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

948
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

949
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,240
I'm willing to fight for anything useful

950
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:29,240
Two cold, heartless people

951
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:37,240
Holding hands, can we get through the snow?

952
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:45,240
In the cold wind, in the long night

953
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:52,240
Embracing the remaining warmth

954
00:52:53,240 --> 00:53:07,240
Holding on, not sure if I can bury the regret from yesterday

955
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:14,240
Loving is to cherish with life

956
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:22,240
To live on, even if it's a little hurtful

957
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,240
No matter sorrow or joy

958
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,240
I believe you

959
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:37,240
Would rather be trapped in the cold of the world

960
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:44,240
To live on, to use up all the courage

961
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:52,240
To love until you're out of breath

962
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,240
To cross over the loneliness of half life

963
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,240
Just to meet you

964
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,980
After the

965
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:07,980
After the

966
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,980
After the

967
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,980
After the
