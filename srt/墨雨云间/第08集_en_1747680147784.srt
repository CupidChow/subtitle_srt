1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I will make a call to you

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I will accept all the gifts of love

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will not let any regrets go to waste

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I will not give up even if I am defeated

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will slowly resist the pain of the world

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will walk through the winter and winter, we will still be the same

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Waiting for the spring to return again

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I am in a good mood today

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I will sit with you for a while

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What are you looking at, Mr. Li?

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Please enjoy your tea, Duke Su

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We will take our leave now

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Will you still treat us to tea today?

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Please do as you wish, Duke Su

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I am just doing the job for His Majesty

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What's there to be proud of?

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Forget it, you don't need to admit this kind of demon

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You can tolerate this evil, but I can't

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mu Zhao Reng

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Chu Xuan, do you really want to order?

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Isn't Lu Yang Ye's family very rich?

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He broke the door of the Imperial College with money

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This painting is a song painting drawn by the former painter Li Zhao Dao

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's priceless

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Everyone, look at this

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This painting was really broken by him

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You are deceiving me and hiding your truth

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I am in a good mood today

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you give me 3,000 taels of gold

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I won't bother you

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What is this?

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Who is that?

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The eldest son of Lu Yang Ye's family

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Isn't that the cousin of Lady Jiang?

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We are disturbing Mr. Li

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We are watching a play

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I must take you to see the official today

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Take her away

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What are you doing?

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't touch me

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Wait

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Excuse me

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Young Master

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Young Master

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What's wrong?

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't go

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Take it

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Lady Jiang, why are you here?

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Lady Meng

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Can I see this painting?

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let me see

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let me see

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Master Li's treasure is really precious

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's hard to find it

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But this painting is fake

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you talking about?

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's really fake

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Look at this painting

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The previous dynasty only produced silk and silk

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This painting is very delicate

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's clearly a double silk

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Master Li's painting

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
How could it be a double silk?

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This seal is fake too

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The previous dynasty didn't use ten seals

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If it's the seal of the previous dynasty

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There must be a special mark of the seal of the previous dynasty

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The bottom of the text

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The top of the text is thicker than the original

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And the color is light

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's yellow

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And the seal of this treasure

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The top of the text is smooth

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And the color is red

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's obviously wrong

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's fake

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No, it's definitely wrong

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's red

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's wrong

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Give me the painting

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Forget it

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't care about you

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Whether you are lying or I'm being deceived

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I will find out

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But even if this is a fake painting

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It has its value

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You ruined my painting

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Give me five taels of gold

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Forget it

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't think about it

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If it wasn't for the second lady

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm afraid you caught me

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Ye Shijie

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't talk nonsense

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
When did I make you money?

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Still not admitting

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Go

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Go to the yard with me to discuss

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Ye Shijie

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You don't want

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Mr. Ye

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Mr. Ye

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This is a misunderstanding

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Miss Meng was also deceived

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's already very miserable

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How about

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Mrs. Jiang

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You don't have to protect her

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
She is angry with me today

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If she is not punished

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
She will be angry with more people in the future

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Today I, Ye Shijie

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't fight for myself

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want to guard the justice

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Justice

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Everyone

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Everyone can take a look

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's her Ye Shijie

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
She said something bad to me

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
She is making a fuss

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's you

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's her

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's her

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
She ruined my reputation

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You ruined her reputation

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You are so mean

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You are a thief

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I can't live anymore

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I can't live anymore

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, okay, okay

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Miss Meng is dead

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You can't live anymore

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There will be a lot of grievances in the future

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You will die a hundred times

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
She is also wrong

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Mr. Ye

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You don't care about each other

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You only care about yourself

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's not like a gentleman

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Jiang Jirui

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Money

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hurry up

152
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I bought this painting

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You can tear it up

154
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And use it as a relief

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In case you cheat the next person

156
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Here

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Who wants your money

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I will give you this painting

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Go

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You care about others

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Who said you care about others

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Sister Jiang is fighting with others on the street

163
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
She is spoiled

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
She has no shame

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Miss Jiang is very brave

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Shouya

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why don't we consider

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
To form a team with Miss Jiang

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
She is also a member of the Jiang family

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
How about it

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You love to be with the water family

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Shouyao

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Mr. Zhou

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I told you earlier

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You are too naive

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You are not good

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If it wasn't for Jiang Li

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I would have eaten Ye Shijie

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If I help him

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He will only be grateful to me

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Li Lian

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They are a family

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If you don't make any plan

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Father will be angry

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I see

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I tell you

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't worry about this

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That Meng Hongqin

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Is the daughter of General Xuanwei

192
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Meng Youde

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I tell you

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
She is so fierce

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
She even dares to bite a dog

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Why did you say that

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You have helped her so much

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You should talk to her about the碎 market

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No hurry

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No hurry?

201
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I will see when you are angry

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You help me take the box

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Miss Jiang

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
My master invites you to drink tea

206
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Su Guokou

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What happened?

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I say, Mr. Jiang

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's just tea

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Tea?

211
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Then let's drink tea together

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Mr. Jiang

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
My master only invites Miss Jiang

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I have nothing to talk with Su Guokou

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I have to go now

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Goodbye

217
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Goodbye

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Go this way

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Go this way

220
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Jiang

221
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's okay

222
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I tell you

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have a bad temper

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
General

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Brother, let's drink tea

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It hurts

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I go up now

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What is your business?

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Today you are the second person

230
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Who asked me about business

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I am your brother

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Please drink tea

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I dare not

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I thought I was brought up

235
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
To be interrogated

236
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Don't be angry

237
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
A Li

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Su Guokou

239
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Li is the word for elder

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I am not familiar with it

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So I call it

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Li Maowa

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
When someone is pinched

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's your look now

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I drink tea

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I go first

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I go first

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Su Guokou

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What do you mean?

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Why did you

251
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Help Ye Shijie?

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ye Shijie

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He is my cousin

254
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I can't leave him alone

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I heard that this year

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There are two schools in Sui

257
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You like him

258
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yes

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So what?

260
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Shen Yurong

261
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Is the host of Sui

262
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Under his rule

263
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Can you pass this level?

264
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If I can't pass this level

265
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What?

266
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Su Guokou

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Do you want to ask him for me

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
A crime of self-harm?

269
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Enough smart

270
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Second wife

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I heard a play before

272
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I think it's good

273
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I will tell you

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The play is called

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
East Sea Palace

276
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They said the East Sea people

277
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Were young and good at fighting

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
They caught snakes and tigers

279
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And were respected

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They thought they would never be defeated

281
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Then there was a big tiger

282
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Who was caught by the fish

283
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The palace went to take the tiger

284
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But it was not caught

285
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Instead it was killed

286
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Have you heard this play?

287
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Su Guokou wants to remind me

288
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I am just a little snake and tiger

289
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I am lucky

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If I meet a real tiger

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I will be killed

292
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Second wife

293
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I rarely give people a life

294
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Today I can't give them a life

295
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You know

296
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
There was a tiger

297
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And a cliff

298
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I advise you to take a break

299
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Think it over

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And then lift your leg

301
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Who is the real tiger?

302
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You will know later

303
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
A'Li

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I can't choose

305
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He wants to kill us

306
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Like a ant

307
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Su Guokou

308
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You have been an official for many years

309
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Have you killed a tiger?

310
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What were you thinking when you killed a tiger?

311
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I was holding a knife

312
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I didn't think of anything

313
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I was thinking of my justice

314
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Justice

315
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's ugly

316
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Look at it

317
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What does my business have to do with you?

318
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Maybe in the future we

319
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Return together

320
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Is it the second wife who stepped on the cake you gave her?

321
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Good guess

322
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If you want to watch a good show

323
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You have to touch the heart first

324
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Tong'er

325
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Tong'er

326
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Sister

327
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Sister

328
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Why are you back so late today?

329
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
After school

330
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Something happened

331
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I had a conflict with someone

332
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Gu Qing will be home soon

333
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's get ready

334
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Madam

335
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The old lady sent a message

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let you go to Wanfeng Hall

337
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You can handle this matter as a mother

338
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Why did you come to me again?

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I always thought that Li'er

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Should learn the etiquette

341
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Then go to Mingyi Hall

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Li'er knows

343
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But I will deal with this

344
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm afraid he will be dissatisfied

345
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Madam

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
He listened to you

347
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I hope you can teach him the rules and rules

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The second wife is here

349
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Li'er greets grandmother

350
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And mother

351
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Second girl

352
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I heard from Yu'e

353
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You were on the street today

354
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And gave a message to Meng Niangzi

355
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Is there such a thing?

356
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes

357
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Do you know

358
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Meng Niangzi's father is General Xuanwei?

359
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Li'er knows

360
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Since you know

361
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why do you still want to be a strong woman?

362
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You do things like this

363
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's also very difficult for your father

364
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Mother

365
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't know what this has to do with my father

366
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't know

367
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
General Xuanwei and Prime Minister Li have a very close relationship

368
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Although they don't seem to be in touch

369
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But in fact, they have a deep relationship

370
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
In the court

371
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Prime Minister Li and your father have different opinions

372
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But now your father and he

373
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Have more differences

374
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Prime Minister Li?

375
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Who is the real Meng Hu?

376
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You will know later

377
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Our Jiang family has always been well-off

378
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The children in the family are most likely to cause trouble

379
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That doesn't mean

380
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Our children made mistakes

381
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
They have to avoid it when they encounter trouble

382
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But the experience is long

383
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The fault is clear

384
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The people are complicated

385
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Your father is in it

386
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There are many difficulties

387
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Second girl

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This time you are reckless

389
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Grandma, please calm down

390
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm also to blame for not taking good care of second sister

391
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Second sister is very straightforward

392
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
She will inevitably bump into other classmates

393
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
In the future, I will just go to the group

394
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You did something wrong

395
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Your second sister just went to the Hall of Fame

396
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
She is not familiar with the rules there

397
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You should take care of her more

398
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
How can you lose her?

399
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Madam

400
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Li'er's accident today

401
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Is also my negligence

402
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
How about following me next

403
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Learn the rules for a few days

404
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I want Li'er to learn as soon as possible

405
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Learn about the human trafficking in the capital

406
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
No hurry

407
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I still want to hear what the second girl said

408
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Grandma

409
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Today's matter is not my fault

410
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I was the one who made a mistake and went to Zhennv Hall

411
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But my father was a nobody for me

412
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I didn't study well and didn't cherish

413
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I said all the bad words to my father

414
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Now it's a coincidence

415
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That Li'er made a false statement

416
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It broke my countless rumors

417
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And also made my father's reputation go down

418
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Moreover

419
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's a false statement but it's not broken

420
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's considered not true

421
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
There is something wrong with this matter

422
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But it doesn't hurt the dignity of everyone

423
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
If I don't say it

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's the wrong way of the Jiang family

425
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So you are also considering the whole situation

426
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Grandma

427
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
No matter how good your second sister is

428
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You can't change the fact that she was fighting with others on the street

429
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
There is no good way to say it

430
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
She was almost fighting with others

431
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The officials were pointing at the Jiang family

432
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Others pointed at the Jiang family

433
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You just watch

434
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I

435
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I

436
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I just heard that

437
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
When I went there, they were gone

438
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Sister

439
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's a false statement

440
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
How can you say that in front of your grandma?

441
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Rumors are so bad

442
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Do you know how shameful it was?

443
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I also heard that

444
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The one who was cheated by Meng Hongjing

445
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Is the eldest son of Luyang Ye's eldest son, Ye Shijie

446
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
He is quite related to my second sister

447
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No wonder your second sister would be worried about him

448
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
They are family

449
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They are also in the capital city

450
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Why did your second sister go home for so long?

451
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
She kept talking about us

452
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It seems that our Jiang family is deliberately distant from relatives

453
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Li

454
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Before you came back

455
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You had a connection with the Ye family

456
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I have never seen Ye Shijie

457
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
If Ruoyao didn't tell me this

458
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I didn't know he was my cousin

459
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I didn't expect that the family living in the capital city is my own relatives

460
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Grandma

461
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Although my birth mother passed away

462
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But with the Ye family

463
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's a marriage

464
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
My own relatives are in the capital city

465
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If I leave without a trace

466
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
My cousin will be tied to the county office

467
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
If this matter is spread out in the future

468
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The people will be shocked

469
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What is the education of the Jiang family?

470
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What is the father?

471
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Why are you talking about your father?

472
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yes

473
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You don't know

474
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Li Buyi was a court official

475
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
He was guilty of miscarriage of his brother's funeral

476
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The juries were angry

477
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
He was sentenced to death

478
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
His Majesty was angry and gave him a stone

479
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's not easy for a father to be an official in the court

480
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
If this matter is spread out

481
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What should I do?

482
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't know who you just said you lost your eyes

483
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Who lost his eyes?

484
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Li Buyi

485
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Li Buyi is right

486
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
For the past ten years

487
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We owe Li Buyi a lot

488
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You are disgusted with your family

489
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Mother can understand

490
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I just hope you can be relieved soon

491
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
After all, you are left with the blood of the Ye family

492
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You are close to your cousin

493
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You don't have to hide it from us

494
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Hide

495
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I think what you said is not true

496
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I believe everything you say

497
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Grandmother

498
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Grandmother

499
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Grandmother

500
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Aunt

501
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Aunt

502
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I am with Jiang Li today

503
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I can testify for her

504
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Jiang Li didn't want to hide it from anyone at first

505
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
At first

506
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
He didn't know who the two people were fighting

507
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's still up to me later

508
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
As for shame

509
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Is it obvious?

510
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Aunt

511
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The door is open

512
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You can listen to it yourself

513
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Everyone present at that time

514
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
No one is against Jiang Li

515
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No one is against it

516
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Our second wife is good in the outside

517
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Knowing that my cousin and my second sister have always been close

518
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Of course I help him talk

519
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But in the end, it's our wife's family

520
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Usually, Li Ying should be cautious

521
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
My second sister is righteous

522
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But women are involved in men's affairs

523
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's still not beautiful and harmful

524
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Harmful

525
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Sister

526
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You are here today

527
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Can you balance the Su State?

528
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
What does it have to do with Su State?

529
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Grandmother, you don't know

530
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Of course it's for our Jiang Li

531
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
No comment

532
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
After that thing is over

533
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We were going to leave

534
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But the Su State invited us

535
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
To invite us to drink tea

536
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What did he say to you?

537
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What did he say?

538
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Nothing

539
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Just said a few words to me

540
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The Su State said

541
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
There are women and women

542
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And asked me to greet my father

543
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Since it's like this

544
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It seems that today's matter

545
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Is not Li's fault

546
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Okay, I understand

547
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You can go back

548
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The children are young

549
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
They are afraid of losing the dignity of the Jiang family

550
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
They are disturbing the old lady's rest

551
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We are leaving now

552
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
We won't disturb the old lady's quiet

553
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Grandmother

554
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I will leave now

555
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Grandmother, Rui'er is leaving too

556
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I was worried

557
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It seems that the second girl

558
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Hid the table

559
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm sorry

560
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I didn't know

561
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You were worried about me

562
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I didn't know

563
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I didn't know

564
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm sorry

565
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The Su State is really good

566
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
No wonder you told Tong'er to tell me

567
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
To take the Su State out in front of Grandmother

568
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
He praised me

569
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
He said that I was a loser

570
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Did the Su State really praise you?

571
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
No

572
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You dare to lie

573
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The Su State will know

574
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
They will definitely get you to settle the accounts

575
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
He is not that idle

576
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Master

577
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Master Li wants to see you

578
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Master Li

579
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yes

580
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I wonder why Mr. Li came to me

581
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I just heard about Meng Hongjing

582
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
He was not humble

583
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
He is really a gentleman

584
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So I was determined to meet him

585
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So I was determined to meet him

586
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
What's wrong?

587
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You are so handsome

588
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm sorry

589
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I came to see you

590
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You are too polite

591
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You used to read the holy books alone

592
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm afraid you don't know much about the capital

593
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
There are many people here

594
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
If you are not reliable

595
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,980
You will be

596
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
From now on

597
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Not to mention the Imperial College

598
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The whole capital

599
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
No one dares to bother you

600
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You mean

601
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You want to be my partner?

602
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yes

603
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The people in the Imperial College

604
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
They just want to get out of the city

605
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Once they leave the city

606
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The official exchange

607
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Will become a learning experience

608
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The study of the study is wise

609
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
The Su State has changed a lot

610
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Let you and me have a chance

611
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
To learn the study of the study

612
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Think about it

613
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
If you come with us

614
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You will win the championship

615
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Not only can you save your future

616
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But also can you study at ease

617
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And can help you solve some unnecessary problems

618
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
What do you think?

619
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You are not in a hurry

620
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You can answer me tomorrow

621
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Goodbye

622
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Goodbye

623
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Madam Jiang

624
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
What's up?

625
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
The time is urgent

626
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I heard you haven't been in the team yet

627
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Thank you for your concern

628
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's true

629
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's a fate

630
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That we have a marriage contract

631
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I admire your experience

632
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
If you are just admitted to the school

633
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And you are being attacked

634
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's a pity

635
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
In the end

636
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I should help you

637
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Have you asked Ruoyao?

638
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
If you want

639
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I will convince Ruoyao

640
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Mr. Zhou

641
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Aren't you with us

642
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Jiang's other sisters?

643
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You are here to beat up Jiang Li

644
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Which one do you want to kick out?

645
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Or you want to eat in the bowl

646
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Or in the pot?

647
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I just want to help Madam Jiang

648
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Besides

649
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I haven't decided about Jiang Ruoyao

650
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
How about this

651
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You go back now

652
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And cancel the marriage contract

653
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Then you can marry Jiang Li

654
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Then you can be a couple

655
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's a deal

656
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Jiang Jingrui

657
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You are too much

658
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I just said what I thought

659
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I just said what I thought

660
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You go back now

661
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And ask your father and daughter-in-law

662
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
If they want you to cancel the marriage contract again

663
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Jiang Li

664
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Let's go

665
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Ignore him

666
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Mr. Ye

667
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Mr. Ye

668
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Are you Dao Enru?

669
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
What do you mean?

670
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I saved you

671
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But you are hiding from me

672
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
What are you afraid of?

673
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Afraid that I will ask you to repay me?

674
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
What else do you want to do?

675
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Buy me a cup of tea

676
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I refuse

677
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
After school

678
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I will wait for you in the teahouse

679
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yesterday you taught Meng Hongjin

680
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I heard about it

681
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So?

682
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I thought you were like them

683
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You are a coward

684
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Who is weak, weak, soft and afraid of hard things

685
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I didn't expect you to be so hard

686
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I am a little hard

687
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But I want to know you again

688
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I am Liu Xu

689
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
If you meet me in the Hall of Fame

690
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Call me by my name

691
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I will protect you

692
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Thank you

693
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I heard you haven't found someone to join the team

694
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I am also

695
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
How about we two?

696
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We two?

697
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And your brother

698
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Who looks not so smart

699
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
He is not so smart

700
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And Ye Shijie?

701
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The one in Luyangye's family

702
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Yes

703
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
He

704
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
He is a little knowledgeable

705
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But he is willing to be in the same team with us

706
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I am not sure

707
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But I have to try

708
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Madam, please

709
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I have been waiting for half an hour

710
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You always have to clean up when you make an appointment

711
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I am coming here very soon

712
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I will pay for the tea

713
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You can drink as much as you want

714
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Cousin

715
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You and I should call each other by our names

716
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We are family

717
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But why do you always turn me away from you?

718
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Madam

719
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You are a noble girl

720
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I am the son of a merchant

721
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I can't afford to be your cousin

722
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
What do you mean?

723
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You forgot that when your grandmother came back to the capital

724
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
To pick you up from Luyang

725
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
What did you say?

726
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
A'Li

727
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Xia A'Li

728
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You have suffered

729
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Come on

730
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Come on

731
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Let me hug you

732
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Come on

733
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Go home with your grandmother

734
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I won't go anywhere

735
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
This is my home

736
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
My home is your home

737
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
No

738
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You are not my family

739
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
A'Li

740
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Why do you say such a nonsense?

741
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
My mother is standing here

742
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I am the wife of the general

743
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I don't want to be a merchant

744
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I won't go with you

745
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
A'Li

746
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You should go with me

747
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You should go with grandmother

748
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Mother

749
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Mother

750
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Mother

751
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Mother

752
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
After grandmother went back

753
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
She was seriously ill

754
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
She had been recuperating for a whole year

755
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Father has been worried about her for many years

756
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Now

757
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You are here to get married

758
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I dare to believe you

759
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So our family

760
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Is cut off from contact

761
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Dare to contact?

762
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What are you doing?

763
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Listen to me first

764
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
There is something

765
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
That has been hidden in my heart for many years

766
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I have been trying to tell grandmother

767
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But I didn't have the chance

768
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You don't have to say it

769
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It's not an excuse

770
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I was young

771
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But I am not that heartless

772
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Back then in front of grandmother and you

773
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I thought what I did

774
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Was protecting the Jiang family and my father

775
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Who knows that I was just young and ignorant

776
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Who knows that I was just young and ignorant

777
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Who knows that I was just young and ignorant

778
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Who knows that I was just young and ignorant

779
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Tong'er

780
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Tell me everything you know

781
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I want to know

782
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The gap between me and the Ye family

783
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
In the ten years of being locked in the Zhen Nv Hall

784
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
My wife has been regretting

785
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
What she did back then

786
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Look, mother is there

787
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Mother, what's wrong?

788
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Mother

789
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Li'er

790
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Li'er, you are here

791
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Li'er, tell me

792
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
What did mother do to you?

793
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Mother treated me very well

794
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Li'er, I grew up

795
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I always wanted to be with you

796
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I even wanted to take off your clothes

797
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But

798
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
But how could I resist

799
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
The rumors of the outsiders?

800
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What did you say?

801
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Mother

802
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Mother

803
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Mother, what's wrong?

804
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Li'er

805
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Your grandmother is coming to pick you up

806
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
There are rumors out there

807
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
That our madam is abusing you

808
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Isn't it normal to say these things?

809
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Look at our madam's heart

810
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So the madam was so abusing

811
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
This is a one-sided father

812
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
What's wrong?

813
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What misunderstanding?

814
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Don't blame me for being rude

815
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
What kind of family is Lu Yangye's family?

816
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That's a business

817
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
He really wants to get married

818
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
He just wants to take you

819
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Look at our master's position

820
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'll help them do business in the future

821
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You are not a person

822
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
People say it's hard to be a person

823
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
If you leave with the Ye family

824
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
That's a fact

825
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The rumors of the outsiders

826
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
That our madam is abusing

827
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That's a rumor

828
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
That our madam is going to die

829
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Mother, don't be angry

830
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm not going anywhere

831
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Jiang's is my home

832
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm not going to bully my mother

833
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
My mother's heart is so painful

834
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I was still young at that time

835
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I believed them foolishly

836
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I treated the Ye family like a wolf

837
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Then how did you live in the family?

838
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
How did you treat your stepmother?

839
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
She is indeed a good person

840
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
People are good to me

841
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't want to learn when I don't want to learn

842
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I don't want to practice when I don't want to practice

843
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I can stop when I don't want to be a female worker

844
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I made a mistake and covered it up for me

845
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Let me grow up at home

846
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
More arrogant and domineering

847
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You mean

848
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Pong Sha

849
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
These are just your words

850
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You tell me this now

851
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's to repair the Ye family

852
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Don't offend Meng family

853
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It turns out that cousin is angry with me because of this

854
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Cousin is blaming me

855
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Why didn't you send Meng Hongjing to the official?

856
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And give him a step down

857
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Isn't it?

858
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I don't want to give him a step down

859
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's just that in the capital

860
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
All parties are complicated

861
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Although the Ye family is rich

862
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
But the children in the family have no official position

863
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
After all, it's a piece of fat under the group

864
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
The official is injured

865
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The official is up and the injury is down

866
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
In fact, it's good for Meng Hongjing to step down

867
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
If cousin is shameless

868
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Then Meng family is just trying to get the best of it

869
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Cousin is also a smart person

870
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I was just angry yesterday

871
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'm just trying to remind you

872
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I understand

873
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Otherwise, I won't forgive him this time

874
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What do you mean?

875
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I always dislike to owe people

876
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
This is a thank you for your goodwill yesterday

877
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Cousin Ye's way of thanking

878
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It really has the characteristics of the Ye family

879
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Your Ye family is a businessman

880
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
But I'm not

881
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
If my righteousness becomes a transaction

882
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Then I will also become a wave of Meng Hongjing

883
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Change a way

884
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
What way do you want?

885
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Match me

886
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Help me pass this level

887
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
This

888
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
This is not difficult for cousin

889
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
To be honest

890
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Li Lian looked for me

891
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Li Zhongnan's son Li Lian

892
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Correct

893
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Cousin knows what is the relationship between Meng Hongjing and Li Lian?

894
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Do I need to know?

895
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Meng Hongjing's father Xuanwei general

896
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And Li Zhongnan have a long-standing relationship

897
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The two families have deep personal relations

898
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Maybe Li Lian and Meng Hongjing have long been familiar

899
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
This is not easy to forget

900
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
When did Li Lian find you?

901
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
After Meng Hongjing made trouble

902
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
This is right

903
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Right what?

904
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I guess he will say

905
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
If you are like him

906
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
From now on

907
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Similar things will not find you again

908
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
How do you know?

909
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So

910
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Meng Hongjing's back is Li Lian

911
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Cousin

912
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Their original plan is

913
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Want to make Meng Hongjing to make you embarrassed

914
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Then when you are helpless

915
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Come out to help you deal with Meng Yangzi

916
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
They just want to get you into trouble

917
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But they didn't expect

918
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Meet me in the middle

919
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You tell me this

920
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Is to make me team up with you

921
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So that you can pass

922
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I am going to stand at the foot of the Mingyi Hall

923
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But what I want most

924
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Is to let the Ye family know

925
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
What is the real Jiang Li

926
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
When I was a kid, I was blinded

927
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So my grandmother was sad

928
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
In fact

929
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
In my heart

930
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Family is the most important

931
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Thank you cousin for treating me to tea

932
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Jiang Li

933
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I promise you

934
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
General Meng is in charge of the order

935
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Don't worry, husband

936
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Give his wife clothes

937
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
The other party also returned the gift

938
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Li Er and Meng Hongjing

939
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
That matter is over

940
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I thought Li Er would be bullied

941
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
When he entered the Mingyi Hall

942
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I didn't expect

943
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
He has such a strong spirit

944
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Husband

945
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You have always been cautious in the court

946
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
The Mingyi Hall and the Imperial College of the Imperial Family

947
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Are all the most important

948
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
After the late emperor

949
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Li Er and Meng Hongjing

950
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It doesn't matter

951
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm afraid this time

952
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
In the future, you will hurt the nobles

953
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And get you involved

954
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
This is too cautious

955
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's all the kids' grudge

956
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I am the prime minister

957
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm not so trapped in this matter

958
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Li Er experienced something special

959
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Husband, did you forget

960
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
How to get him back

961
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
There are some things

962
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That will be heard by the world

963
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm afraid

964
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
If you keep going

965
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You will be in trouble

966
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You worry too much

967
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
If Li Er can really do such a big thing

968
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I will be strict

969
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Come here

970
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Sister Ye

971
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Really agreed to come to our team

972
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You seem to care about him

973
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I care about you

974
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Don't go

975
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Did he agree

976
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You can ask him yourself later

977
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Xiangli

978
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I have been running for an afternoon

979
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
The whole Guo Zijian

980
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Everyone is in the team

981
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Except you and me

982
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Ye Shijie

983
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
There is one person left

984
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I can only think of another way

985
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
This is not the first day of school

986
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I have a bad temper

987
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And then I had a fight with someone

988
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I went to class and slept

989
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The daughter of the vice minister of the Ministry of Revenue

990
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Liu Xu

991
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Jiang Jinrui

992
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Jiang Li

993
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Even if we have to make up for someone

994
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Don't look for him

995
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Jiang Jinrui

996
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Jiang Li

997
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Don't blame me for not reminding you

998
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
If you want to live a life of drunkenness

999
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You have to be more cautious

1000
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Like him

1001
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Slip tongue

1002
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
The one who boasts about it

1003
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Will only be a mess

1004
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
But Liu Niangzi

1005
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You don't have to worry

1006
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I will do my best

1007
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
To make up for your shortcomings

1008
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
What's my shortcomings

1009
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
We are all classmates

1010
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Don't break it

1011
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Jiang Jinrui

1012
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'll give you a face

1013
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
My lady

1014
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
You are really cruel

1015
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Who is cruel

1016
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Let go

1017
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Let go

1018
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Let go

1019
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It hurts

1020
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Let go

1021
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Mr. Ye

1022
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You are here

1023
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
This is killing without blood

1024
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
What's wrong with you

1025
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Nothing

1026
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Ye Shijie

1027
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Ye Shijie

1028
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I didn't expect you to refuse Mr. Li

1029
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
To be with these

1030
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
East worm, down grass

1031
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Is it the East worm, down grass

1032
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Or the crooked, rusted, cracked, and rotten

1033
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Meng Hongjie

1034
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You can't even make it clear

1035
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I don't want to talk to you

1036
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Like a crooked, rusted, and rotten

1037
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Ye Shijie

1038
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You leave them now

1039
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It's not too late to be with us

1040
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Then the reward of the emperor

1041
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Will be yours

1042
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Thanks to Mr. Li's appreciation

1043
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But I haven't promised Jiang Li

1044
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I can't do it

1045
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Haven't you heard

1046
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Jiang Li's good deeds in Zhennv Hall

1047
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
With such an ungrateful person like him

1048
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Being together

1049
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'm not afraid to tarnish your reputation

1050
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Meng Hongjie

1051
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
People here are all reasonable

1052
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But you are all wise

1053
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
You are so arrogant

1054
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
You are so shameless

1055
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Apologize

1056
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Apologize

1057
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Ridiculous

1058
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Why should I apologize to you

1059
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Those who are about to be expelled from the school

1060
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Ye Shijie

1061
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
No matter how good you are

1062
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
You will be dragged down

1063
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
With them

1064
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm afraid you will be disappointed

1065
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
We are looking at the overall score

1066
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
With Mr. Ye

1067
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Our team is not far from each other

1068
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Really?

1069
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Then make a bet

1070
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
If you are eliminated

1071
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Ye Shijie

1072
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Then you kneel in front of the public

1073
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Apologize

1074
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Meng Hongjie

1075
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Is there something wrong with your brain

1076
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Are you learning Jiang Li's justice and straight words

1077
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
He has a father of the country

1078
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Do you have

1079
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Meng Hongjie

1080
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I tell you

1081
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
If you are so unreasonable

1082
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Be careful of my iron fist

1083
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You will die

1084
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I don't think you dare to respond

1085
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You are all scoundrels

1086
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I bet with you

1087
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Since you want to bet

1088
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
The conditions are mutual

1089
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
If we are not eliminated

1090
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Then you

1091
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Meng Hongjie will kneel down

1092
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Apologize to Jiang Li

1093
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
What?

1094
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Dare not

1095
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
On the contrary

1096
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You just made me angry

1097
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I'm changing my way of reading now

1098
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
If you are eliminated

1099
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
All of you today

1100
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Kneel down and apologize to me

1101
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Apologize

1102
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
This is between you and me

1103
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It has nothing to do with others

1104
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Don't be too much

1105
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Didn't you just

1106
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Look like you were still being righteous

1107
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
What

1108
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I can't bear to see your cousin kneel down for me

1109
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Senior

1110
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Since you put us all in

1111
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
How can we forget the Li family's son

1112
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
If we are eliminated

1113
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
We can kneel down

1114
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
But if we are not eliminated

1115
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Then you

1116
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And Li family's son

1117
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Kneel down for me

1118
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Apologize

1119
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
How dare you

1120
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Who is going to play with you

1121
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
This time

1122
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You have put Li family's son's knees

1123
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
In

1124
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
This bet

1125
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
We can bet like this

1126
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
We can bet like this

1127
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
You

1128
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You are all crazy

1129
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I don't want to argue with you

1130
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Why did I hear someone talking about me

1131
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Li son is here

1132
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Li son is here

1133
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Li son

1134
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You don't know

1135
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
How much they have gone too far

1136
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
They said they bet

1137
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
If they lose

1138
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Let us kneel down for them

1139
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Meng Hong

1140
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You can really make a bad person to report first

1141
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
We are all students of the same family

1142
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Why kneel down

1143
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Kneel down

1144
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It's not good to spread it out

1145
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It's still Li son who knows the etiquette

1146
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But Li son

1147
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
You have to teach your classmates

1148
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I just found out

1149
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
This bet is all based on the matter of Jiang Erniangzi in Zhennv hall

1150
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Of course I can't blame others

1151
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Since you all want to hide

1152
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
How about this

1153
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Our two teams are competing

1154
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
If you lose

1155
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Jiang Erniangzi will go back to Zhennv hall by herself

1156
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Go back to Zhennv hall

1157
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Meng Hongji is the first to bite

1158
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Why should we let Jiang Li go back

1159
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Then if we lose

1160
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I, Li Lian, am willing to be a monk

1161
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Jiang Li

1162
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
From now on

1163
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
You are me

1164
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I am you

1165
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
In the future, we will decide our own way

1166
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
No one can send us away

1167
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Everything is from Zhennv hall

1168
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I take you away

1169
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
From now on

1170
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Never look back

1171
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Li son

1172
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
This is the matter between me and Meng Niangzi

1173
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
You don't have to involve yourself and others

1174
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Mr. Ye

1175
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
If you change your mind and come to me

1176
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
The bet just now

1177
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
All gone

1178
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
You have been an official for many years

1179
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Have you killed a tiger

1180
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
What are you thinking about when killing a tiger

1181
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I can't do anything

1182
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
No need to waste

1183
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I accept the bet

1184
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Good

1185
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I will keep my word

1186
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
It's hard to follow

1187
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I will keep my word

1188
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I will keep my word

1189
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I will keep my word
