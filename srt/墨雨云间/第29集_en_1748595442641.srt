1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't admit it

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
When the spring color is still the same

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What a bad thing

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I've been teaching it for so many years

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I was forced into the mirror by a yellow-haired girl

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I even saw my hand cut off to Liu Wencai

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm so crazy

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
My father still has a face to teach

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Since I was a child

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You only treat us as your sister's tool to conquer the whole world

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If it wasn't for your carelessness

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm afraid that I wouldn't be so crazy

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You still treat me as your father

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You know you're my father

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Then you should do something that should be done by a man

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What do you mean?

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You write a letter to the crown prince

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Say that this is not a father's fault

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're willing to be a monk

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You go to the Buddha to be punished for the innocent

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Are you crazy?

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why should I do this?

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
To save my sister

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
To save your sister

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You should leave your father

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You just have to be grateful

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When the wind blows

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll find a way to take you back

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And continue your life

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're so good at talking

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You know I've been in the temple for years

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's why you're so crazy

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If you don't want to help me

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Then you're not just a daughter

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You...

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You...

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Madam

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The medicine is ready

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll send it to you tonight

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
All of this

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Is all my fault

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If it's a Jiang family

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I thought I've already seen it well

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I didn't expect to let the night market

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Find the way to the ceremony

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The child went early

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Leave a second girl

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's so pitiful

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't believe him

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What mother and son

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
A bowl of dirty water

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He went after her

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He's a new wife

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Now I remember

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm so confused

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Madam

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't blame yourself too much

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
When the night market was there

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Even if it was outside

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Madam

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're so careful

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You can't stop the worries outside

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't love me

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's wrong

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's wrong

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Madam

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Second mother wants to see you

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Come

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Second girl

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You have time to rest

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I want to ask

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How can we solve the crisis

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Ouracking

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
has already been discussed

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,640
Let people carry the PSY

87
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,440
For the medicine,

88
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,600
give it to him later.

89
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,720
Okay.

90
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,240
I'll send him to the last city.

91
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,440
I want to

92
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
tell you some things clearly.

93
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,640
You can go

94
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,400
when it's time.

95
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,920
Thank you, grandmother.

96
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,960
Girl.

97
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,560
Girl.

98
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,000
I know you've been wronged

100
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,600
for all these years.

101
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,400
But even now,

102
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,120
you're so cruel.

103
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,680
You can't be so innocent.

104
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,960
But don't worry.

105
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,360
You have to beg for anything in the future.

106
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,360
As long as you can do what you can,

107
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,480
you'll do it.

108
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
It doesn't matter.

109
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,200
candies in the way

110
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,960
to get your best colleges

111
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,680
Stop.

112
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,440
I don't want to use this.

113
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,640
I don't ask you to do this.

114
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,480
Girl,

115
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,360
Your Highness duke has sent me a message.

116
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,800
A lite, I've bowed my finger before it lay on it.

117
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,760
It said in Fair Envoy's image

118
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,760
that they lost everything,

119
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,200
that someone else took care of them.

120
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,560
Although the worst of the worst,

121
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,160
the epidemic is still in effect.

122
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,320
So,

123
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,960
please leave the country to Mrs. Jiang.

124
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,360
Jiang Xiangguo,

125
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,760
you didn't know

126
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,080
what I said.

127
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,680
I heard it clearly.

128
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,400
Girl.

129
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,600
Where are you going?

130
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Such good news.

131
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
I must tell mother quickly.

132
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,560
Let her go.

133
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
We've wronged her.

134
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,720
We've wronged her.

135
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
Consort Li.

136
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,640
The message is here.

137
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Mrs. Jiang has agreed.

138
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,400
Leave.

139
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,040
Yes.

140
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,440
Xiang Yi.

141
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,200
Uncle Ji.

142
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,600
It's time for you to pay back the debt.

143
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,600
It's here.

144
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,560
Uncle Ji.

145
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,400
You're so evil.

146
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,680
You owe me Yu'er's life.

147
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,120
You should pay back.

148
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Shuren.

149
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,800
Don't fight anymore.

150
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,600
Xiang Lan, don't fight with me.

151
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,200
Xiang Lan, don't fight with me.

152
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,560
Uncle Ji.

153
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,600
It's time for you to pay back the debt.

154
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,920
You owe me Yu'er's life.

155
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,800
You should pay back.

156
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Xiang Lan.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,760
You should pay back.

158
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,800
Come down and pay back.

159
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
I'm so sorry.

160
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
I didn't mean it.

161
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,800
You owe me Yu'er's life.

162
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,400
Xiang Yi.

163
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
You're so evil.

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,600
Come down and pay back.

165
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Yu'er's life.

166
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,400
Your life.

167
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
What are you doing here?

168
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm here to see you off.

169
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Don't be scared.

170
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm the mother of the Jiang family.

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,600
My son is the eldest son of the country, Jiang Bingji.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
My sister is the most favored concubine in the world.

173
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,800
I have a family.

174
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
You don't understand me.

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,800
The mother of the Jiang family.

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You forgot

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the position of the Jiang family.

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You're the eldest son of the Jiang family.

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're the eldest son of the Jiang family.

180
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
How did you do it?

181
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
What do you mean?

182
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,000
Aunt Hu told me.

183
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
I heard from Ji Shuran and Sun Mama.

184
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
The doctor who was sick at night

185
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,600
came back to the capital.

186
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,200
He had to find someone to kill him.

187
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,000
Kill him?

188
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
You mean

189
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,200
my mother died because of me?

190
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,800
She was weak.

191
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,000
She was weak.

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,400
She was just a little girl.

193
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,600
But after a month,

194
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,800
her body

195
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,600
was already well-being.

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
She was suddenly so weak.

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,600
She must have been sick for half a year.

198
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
Now I think

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
maybe Ji Shuran didn't

200
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
buy the doctor who was sick at that time.

201
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,000
She made a hand-pick in the medicine shop.

202
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
You bastard.

203
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
You're a mad woman.

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,400
Father will never believe her.

205
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
I'll teach you a lesson when I go out.

206
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,600
If you're willing,

207
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,000
I can send you to see her.

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What?

209
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Aunt Hu

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
went to see her daughter.

211
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,000
She left me a letter before she left.

212
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,000
She only knew you were poison to my mother.

213
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Are you going to find her a funeral?

214
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Lei Yun.

215
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,200
I want to see Jiang Xiangdu.

216
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Open the door.

217
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,600
It's useless to teach you.

218
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Ji Shuran.

219
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,200
Grandmother and father have been in contact with you.

220
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,800
It's just that you lost a child.

221
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,800
But now you're officially

222
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,000
your wife

223
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,600
is just a conspiracy of you.

224
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,600
You know that

225
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
leaving people's lives will change your trust.

226
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Now,

227
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,000
your retribution is coming.

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,400
Those people who are stubborn,

229
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,200
they're not willing.

230
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,800
They want to get pregnant.

231
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,800
They won't let you go even if they're ghosts.

232
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,800
You can't beat them, Ji Shuran.

233
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Remember.

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,600
From now on,

235
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,000
no one in the Jiang family will believe you.

236
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Jiang Li.

237
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,000
I won't let you go even if I'm a ghost.

238
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
I won't let you go even if I'm a ghost.

239
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,400
Okay.

240
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Go find her.

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,200
You saw Jiang Li in the Ninth Quarters.

242
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,600
Jiang Li won't let you go even if he's the first one.

243
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
You...

244
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
What did you say?

245
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
You...

246
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,600
You're not Jiang Li.

247
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
Do you know that

248
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,000
Jiang Li was in a lot of trouble

249
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,200
in the Ten Years' Poverty.

250
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
She was supposed to be loved by her father

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and be a good daughter.

252
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
But what happened?

253
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
You killed my mother.

254
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,600
You're not enough.

255
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
You still want to insult her reputation.

256
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,600
You want to send her away.

257
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
You want to send her to those people's hands

258
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,600
and let her be tortured to death.

259
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
And tortured to death, Ji Shuran.

260
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,000
Do you understand those pain and pain?

261
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Do you understand?

262
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,200
Do you know how to hurt people?

263
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
I...

264
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm a baby.

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can't do that.

266
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,800
I can't do that.

267
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Ji Shuran has been a ghost for ten years.

268
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
You have countless chances.

269
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
You can save her.

270
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,200
You can save yourself.

271
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But you didn't do anything wrong.

272
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
You're now in the end.

273
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
You're the one who saved yourself.

274
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
From now on,

275
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,200
you have to reflect on your evil

276
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,600
every day.

277
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,200
I'm also a ghost.

278
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm also a ghost.

279
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
A ghost.

280
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
A ghost.

281
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
A ghost.

282
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,200
I'm also a baby.

283
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
A ghost.

284
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
A ghost.

285
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I'm a baby.

286
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Lady, slow down.

287
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Slow down.

288
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Lady.

289
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Lady, you're...

290
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Lady.

291
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Lady.

292
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
You have to rest well.

293
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Lady.

294
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Lady will be fine.

295
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Consort Li has opened her mouth.

296
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
No one will hurt her.

297
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
I just want to know

298
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
if she's not willing to die

299
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
when she's doing the medicine for me.

300
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Lady.

301
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
How is she?

302
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
She's crazy.

303
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Father is in pain.

304
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
What do you think

305
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
she's going to do?

306
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Since she's crazy,

307
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
let her go to the woods.

308
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm going to go to the woods.

309
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
I'm going to go to the woods.

310
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
I'm going to go to the woods.

311
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
I'm going to go to the woods.

312
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm going to go to the woods.

313
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Let her feel

314
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
the pain that Lady Hu has been through.

315
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Li'er.

316
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Are you hating me?

317
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
I don't know

318
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
how she's going to do it.

319
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
But I know

320
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
when your mother's illness

321
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
was getting worse,

322
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
I only thought that she was weak.

323
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
I never thought

324
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
she was killed by others.

325
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
If I knew,

326
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
I would never let Ji Shu Zhan

327
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
enter the Jiang family's gate.

328
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
I shouldn't have

329
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
blamed you for killing your mother.

330
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
I've been in the dark for ten years.

331
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
I even

332
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
almost lost you.

333
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Li'er.

334
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
You're still

335
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
hating me for the time being.

336
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
I don't hate you.

337
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
I forgive you.

338
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Li'er.

339
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Father.

340
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,200
If you want to hear this,

341
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
I can tell you.

342
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
But do you think

343
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
it's possible?

344
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
You can't imagine

345
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
what you've been through

346
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
in this girl's hall.

347
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
You're always

348
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
eating alone in ten years.

349
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
You're always washing clothes and sewing.

350
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
You've been sick and cold.

351
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
You've been in a bad mood.

352
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
You're always

353
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
living in others' eyes.

354
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
You're always waiting

355
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
for your family to come to you.

356
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Even if you give a letter,

357
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
you won't have anything.

358
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
You won't have anything.

359
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
So you're disappointed.

360
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
You feel like you're completely abandoned.

361
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
I want to go back to Jiang Family.

362
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
You've worked hard for death.

363
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
But even this wish

364
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
can't be achieved.

365
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Sister.

366
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I want to go back to Jiang Family.

367
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I want to go back to Jiang Family.

368
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
You're always waiting for me.

369
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Father.

370
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Why don't you tell me?

371
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Tell Li'er

372
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
how this scar

373
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
can heal in ten years.

374
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Only the scar can heal,

375
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
but the scar will always exist.

376
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Because of the retribution.

377
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
The scar will always exist.

378
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Your Li'er

379
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
can't come back.

380
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
You...

381
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
You're not going to the court?

382
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Ruo Yao has been

383
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
always making trouble to see her mother.

384
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
I want to take her

385
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
to leave the capital for a few days.

386
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
I want to change her.

387
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Then...

388
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
What about Li'er?

389
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
As she wishes.

390
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Let Ji Shuran

391
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
go to the capital.

392
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
You're not staying in the capital?

393
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Now,

394
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
you're just

395
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
making your relationship with your father...

396
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Mother.

397
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Maybe I'm

398
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
a little bit far away.

399
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
It's her

400
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
most desired

401
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
to not interfere with Li'er.

402
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
I think so.

403
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Congratulations, Your Highness.

404
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
The victory begins.

405
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
The battle is over.

406
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
The soldiers are suffering.

407
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
They're suffering.

408
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Let's have a drink tonight.

409
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Cheers!

410
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Cheers!

411
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
All right.

412
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Let's go.

413
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Yes.

414
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
My sister

415
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
is not very useful.

416
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Although she's not very good at it,

417
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
she has an accident.

418
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
The Ji family

419
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
has paid a lot of price.

420
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Jiang Yuan Bai is not a good person.

421
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
He's going to the court.

422
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Then my brother's court

423
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
is all ours.

424
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Since it's nothing,

425
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
let's leave the court.

426
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Your Majesty.

427
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Your Majesty.

428
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Prince Cheng has taken

429
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
my Yan State

430
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
as a lost land

431
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
and has taken the emperor

432
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
to the northern border.

433
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
The people of Beijing

434
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
have also got the An Dun.

435
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Such a great thing.

436
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
It's a great honor.

437
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
I'm going to reward you.

438
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
I'm going to be a soldier

439
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
and a soldier.

440
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Li Xing, what do you think

441
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
I should reward you?

442
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Although the State of Dai is retreating,

443
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,720
I still have a lot of

444
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
heart to my Yan State.

445
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,200
I'm going to reward you

446
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
as a soldier and a general

447
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
to strengthen my power in the northern border.

448
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I'm going to be a soldier

449
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
and a general to strengthen my power in the northern border.

450
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
What do you think, Shu Qing?

451
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm going to be a soldier.

452
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm going to be a soldier.

453
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm going to be a soldier.

454
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
I'm going to be a soldier.

455
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
This is a bad thing.

456
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Those officials

457
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
have become the people of Prince Cheng.

458
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Jiang Yuan Bai is not here.

459
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Only a group of people

460
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
are left to help Li Zhongnan.

461
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Your Majesty, don't worry.

462
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
The state of Cheng is in danger.

463
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
It's hard to get rid of the internal organs.

464
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Your Majesty,

465
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
you can't be too anxious

466
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
to be a soldier.

467
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I know that.

468
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
But it's hard to get rid of the internal organs.

469
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
The state of Cheng has the state of Cheng.

470
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
We can't deny it.

471
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
I just got the informant.

472
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
The internal organs of the state of Zhao

473
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
are about to end.

474
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
The state of Zhao is in danger.

475
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Exactly.

476
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
The state of Zhao is in danger.

477
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
The state of Zhao is in danger.

478
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
It's a success to be a state.

479
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
In order to prevent the rebel army

480
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
from coming back to the capital,

481
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
what he needs now

482
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
is a reliable ally.

483
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
And we have such a ally in the south.

484
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
The soldiers of Prince Cheng

485
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
are not enough.

486
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
How can you be sure?

487
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
He will help us.

488
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
The state of Zhao is young.

489
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
There is no Zi Si.

490
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Only a sister.

491
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
The internal organs of the state of Zhao

492
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
are damaged into my smoke.

493
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
I saved them in the south.

494
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
And he has been smoking in my house.

495
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
You have a plan.

496
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Good.

497
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
We congratulate the state of Zhao

498
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
for inviting the state of Zhao

499
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
to come to our country.

500
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
We will do our best

501
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
to make the world know

502
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
that the state of Zhao is in a good relationship with me.

503
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Okay. I will do it now.

504
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
By the way,

505
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
such a national gift

506
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
is from the letter of the chancellor Jiang Yuan Bai

507
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
who will be with the Ministry of Rites and Honglu.

508
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Now he is going to the house of the Gao family.

509
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
The Minister of Rites

510
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
has a difficult to handle.

511
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
If you try your best,

512
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
you will be in danger.

513
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Do you have any suitable candidate?

514
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Since His Majesty asked about this,

515
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
I think there is a suitable candidate in his mind.

516
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
What do you think of Shen Yurong?

517
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
He is good.

518
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
But His Majesty should know his background.

519
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Then this time,

520
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
will the chess piece around you

521
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,200
give up the chance to get close to Shen Yurong?

522
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
His Majesty is going to put that chess piece

523
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
in danger.

524
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Are you worried that he will be in danger?

525
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
A chess piece

526
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
will be dead.

527
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,200
It is not a good thing for us.

528
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
You are the one who killed the most

529
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
in the previous chess piece.

530
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,200
You are the one who killed the most.

531
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
What?

532
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Did you hesitate today?

533
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Not only did I hesitate.

534
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Xiao Heng,

535
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
did you go to the theater?

536
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
No.

537
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
You are the best.

538
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Haven't you found the four-leaf clover?

539
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Master, why do you have to find him?

540
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Last time, Mo Min was so angry with you

541
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
that he moved the whole State Office's wine to the sky.

542
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Master,

543
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
I mean,

544
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
the four-leaf clover

545
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
is fine.

546
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
He likes to go to the mountains and forests.

547
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
He won't come out

548
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
every ten days and a half months.

549
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Unless he wants to get the medicine.

550
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Send someone else.

551
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
You must find him before

552
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
the Great Zhao Group comes.

553
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Yes.

554
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Your Highness,

555
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
our men have sent a message.

556
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
The Great Zhao Group is going to send a envoy to Da Yan.

557
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
The Great Zhao Group has been in the camp.

558
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
The two countries will be in a hurry.

559
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
The Great Zhao Army will personally lead the envoy to Da Yan.

560
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
The Great Zhao Group and Da Yan are good friends.

561
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
They are a pervert to us.

562
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
What's the plan?

563
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
The two countries are in a hurry.

564
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
But they came too soon.

565
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
What do you mean?

566
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
The Great Zhao Group escaped from Da Yan

567
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
in a mess before the Great Zhao Group.

568
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
The reason why he came personally

569
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
is to take the princess back.

570
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
I'm afraid Zhao Ye has already found the princess.

571
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
So the Great Zhao Army

572
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
led the troops to Da Yan personally.

573
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
The Cheng Yan is a good match.

574
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
The Cheng Yan is a good match.

575
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
If the princess of the Great Zhao

576
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
dies in Da Yan,

577
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
I will

578
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
be the one to take the throne.

579
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Go and take care of Xiao Heng.

580
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
Take care of everyone around him.

581
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Yes.

582
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Please disappear.

583
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
시면 Party was restored in time.

584
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
There is a release command force response.

585
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
You are...

586
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Finally the group has been recharged.

587
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
It is a pity.

588
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
The lead was wrong!

589
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
A unloved guest.

590
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,360
Can you let her

591
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
come online with us?

592
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
I just give you a relief.

593
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,520
You can't compare with the old people.

594
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,720
As for the talents that the Shui Team needs,

595
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,720
I will follow the rules of the Ministry of Rites

596
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,640
and make a plan for you.

597
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,280
I will make a plan for you.

598
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,520
If you have any intention to take this decision,

599
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,360
please give me a name card.

600
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,440
Then I will thank you for your concern.

601
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,880
I will take my leave.

602
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:22,920
I will take my leave.

603
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,480
Shen Xueshi,

604
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,160
this meeting is very important.

605
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,920
You should take care of yourself.

606
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,400
If you need anything,

607
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,440
I will help you.

608
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,280
Thank you.

609
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Eat more.

610
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,960
Eat more.

611
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,480
Eat more.

612
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,560
You know how to eat.

613
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,160
A Li is so thin.

614
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,160
Don't you know how to persuade him?

615
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,280
You don't know how to remove A Li's temper.

616
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,280
Besides,

617
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,640
you don't know me.

618
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,000
Why don't you say Ye Shijie?

619
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,280
My husband is her new lover.

620
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,920
Perhaps he wants to see her.

621
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,300
Black Feather Ranked

622
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,320
they just melted in the ice.

623
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,000
The minister of scientists

624
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,200
for culturalzone could not avoid his decision.

625
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
The minister 듯

626
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,200
To my husband,

627
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Eat together.

628
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
What did you just say?

629
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
He asked you to eat with him.

630
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Come, eat quickly.

631
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Okay.

632
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Everything will get better.

633
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Li'er.

634
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
The time of the big day is coming.

635
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
The court has chosen the receptionist.

636
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
You can take part in it.

637
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
I just heard Jingrui and Liu Xu say

638
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
they will all take part.

639
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
If we are in the middle,

640
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
we can get up again.

641
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
No.

642
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
I just want to rest well during this time.

643
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Then you...

644
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Liu Xu, Jiang Jingrui.

645
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Don't come to me.

646
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,200
I will go first.

647
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Okay.

648
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Zheng.

649
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Now, dad can eat and drink normally.

650
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Although he may not remember us for the time being,

651
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
but as long as he is alive,

652
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
he will have a hope.

653
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,200
I was alone when I came to the capital.

654
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
Now,

655
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
I have dad by my side.

656
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
And I have a friend who is hard to get along with.

657
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
Zhao.

658
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Am I very lucky?

659
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
But I...

660
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
But I...

661
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
You are very hard to get along with.

662
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
So,

663
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,200
no one will be implicated by me.

664
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Tong.

665
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
No parents are living here anymore.

666
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,300
All this requires

667
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
one day to realize after you leave luôn.

668
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
You want to go in the city,

669
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
you know nobody bit you.

670
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Everyone on my mind is too useless.

671
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
People look for you on those streets.

672
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
To find L nagging.

673
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
You want to go in the city?

674
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
No.

675
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
I only wanted to go to the city.

676
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,520
Zhao Ke brought him back.

677
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,560
He doesn't trust others.

678
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,280
Be careful when you see him later.

679
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Wife!

680
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,320
Kureka can't pick her own name!

681
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,500
Xun ejean.

682
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,600
She cares about us.

683
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,340
Good Comb.

684
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,160
Good one!

685
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,660
Thank you!

686
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,480
Good!

687
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:53,740
Hang's

688
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,740
Begonia, it's me.

689
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,740
Begonia, it's me. Don't be afraid.

690
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,740
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

691
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,740
Don't touch me.

692
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,740
It's me, Begonia. It's me.

693
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,740
I'm the Consort of the Snow.

694
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,740
Begonia.

695
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,740
Begonia, it's me.

696
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,740
You're still alive.

697
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,740
I'm still alive.

698
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,740
Let me see you.

699
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,740
What's wrong with you?

700
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,740
It's me.

701
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,740
I'm still alive.

702
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,740
I can't stand you anymore.

703
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,740
I'm sorry.

704
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,740
I'm sorry.

705
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,740
I should have brought you away.

706
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,740
I'm sorry.

707
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,740
I'm sorry.

708
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,740
What happened after you left?

709
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,740
After I sent a letter to the Wolf Lord,

710
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,740
someone was taken to the Ma Dai.

711
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,740
Come on.

712
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,740
Throw it here.

713
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,740
Go.

714
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,740
When I woke up,

715
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,740
the Wolf Lord was already in the forest.

716
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,740
They thought I was dead,

717
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,740
so they left.

718
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,740
I ran past the forest and didn't dare to go back.

719
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,740
I didn't dare to go back to my hometown.

720
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,740
I was afraid they would catch me.

721
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,740
So I spent months in the next county.

722
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,740
I spent months in the next county.

723
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,740
I spent months in the next county.

724
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,740
I went back to my hometown and met my father.

725
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,740
After I heard it,

726
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,740
I knew the cause of the blood.

727
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,740
Begonia.

728
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,740
It's hard for you.

729
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,740
I'm sorry.

730
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,740
Lady, you didn't say sorry to me.

731
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,740
It's the people who hurt us who said sorry to us.

732
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,740
I should have been with the Shen Family.

733
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,740
I just want you to live well.

734
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,740
I just want you to live well.

735
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,740
Take good care of yourself here.

736
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,740
I will make you take good care of yourself.

737
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,740
Duke Su, I have a favor to ask you.

738
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,740
You want to say that his father

739
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,740
is a doctor?

740
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,740
Yes.

741
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,740
If I come to you in September, please tell me.

742
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,740
I want to ask for the blood and the sugar.

743
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,740
He is a poison.

744
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,740
You don't know it.

745
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,740
I will ask for it.

746
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,740
I will inform you when I get in touch with him.

747
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,740
Duke Su, please.

748
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,740
Do you know how to protect a person?

749
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,740
You want to protect the person who pushed you away.

750
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,740
You want to keep him by your side.

751
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,740
You want to keep him by your side.

752
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,740
Did you do that?

753
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
I don't need it.

754
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,740
Duke Su, you really can't change it.

755
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,740
You are so bad at listening to others.

756
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,740
You are too loud.

757
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,740
So it's my fault.

758
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,740
It's good that you know it's your fault.

759
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,740
The street in the Great Zhaos is Zheng Xuan.

760
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,740
Do you want to go?

761
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,740
Why do you say that?

762
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,740
It's Shen Yurong who is responsible for this.

763
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,740
Duke Su,

764
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,740
you told me the story of the Eastern Sea Palace.

765
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,740
Today I will tell you a story of a beautiful woman.

766
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,740
When a young man went out for a walk,

767
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,740
he was so beautiful that he fell in love with a woman.

768
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,740
He was so beautiful that he fell in love with a woman.

769
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,740
When he was in a mess,

770
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,740
he abandoned his wife and went back to the capital.

771
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,740
The young man gave his parents' order and married a female monkey.

772
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,740
I never thought that the female female monkey

773
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,740
would not only look like a female monkey,

774
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,740
but also have a good taste in detail.

775
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,740
The young man decided that

776
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,740
the monkey wouldn't want to marry a real female monkey.

777
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,740
So he asked someone to marry her.

778
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,740
The woman who was officially abandoned

779
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,740
was the wife of the man who was married.

780
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
She was so shameless.

781
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,740
The young man didn't think about

782
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,740
his own guess.

783
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,740
In the end,

784
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,740
guess what happened?

785
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,740
He killed that enemy woman.

786
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,740
Duke Su,

787
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,740
why do you like to play the role of killing?

788
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,740
Could it be that

789
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,740
he is more than a double-dead woman?

790
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,740
Please take a look.

791
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,740
I will play this play

792
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,740
for Duke Su.

793
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,740
Why didn't Jiang Li participate?

794
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,740
Didn't he want to

795
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,740
ask for a leave with Shen Yu Rong?

796
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,740
What are you doing?

797
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,740
I'm not smart.

798
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,740
Why?

799
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,740
Li must be in a bad mood.

800
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,740
There are so many things happening in your family.

801
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,740
And he left suddenly.

802
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,740
Who can be in a mood to learn?

803
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,740
And to ask for a leave?

804
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,740
People who like to learn from them,

805
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,740
learn from them is the cure.

806
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,740
You don't believe in your own time?

807
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,740
Since Jiang Li doesn't want to participate,

808
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,740
let's not mention it.

809
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,740
Let him be quiet.

810
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,740
We don't want to disturb him.

811
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,740
That's not good.

812
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,740
Then we can't let him be alone.

813
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,740
What are you talking about?

814
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,740
What are you doing?

815
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,740
You are walking without sound.

816
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,740
Where are you going?

817
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,740
Cousin,

818
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,740
Shen Yu Rong sent

819
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,740
the matter to Shi Tan.

820
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,740
Right?

821
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,740
Yes.

822
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,740
I want to join.

823
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,740
Cheng Li

824
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,740
Hey,

825
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,740
three翅膀

826
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,740
theOS

827
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,800
Xin Yiming

828
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,760
were all Jin Wei

829
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,100
when you went to seeibilang

830
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,740
How could you!

831
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,740
Is that true?

832
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,740
Who knows?

833
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,040
Then,

834
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,840
Brother.

835
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,120
I'm at the Zhao Group.

836
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,680
Can I help you?

837
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,000
Just put it down.

838
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,680
Okay.

839
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,600
All right.

840
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,160
Right.

841
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,040
My son.

842
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,480
How are

843
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,080
you doing at Zhao Group?

844
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,200
I'm good.

845
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,440
I heard from your sister

846
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,880
that so many people

847
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,760
and taught the man the name of the man.

848
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,880
Did that Jiang Er

849
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,040
teach the man the name of the man?

850
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,880
I have a suggestion.

851
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,640
Now, the Shen family

852
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,120
can eat such a delicious food

853
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,400
and live such a good life.

854
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,520
They all depend on the Princess of the Chief.

855
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,320
You must be careful

856
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,520
before doing anything.

857
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,680
Don't make the Princess of the Chief angry.

858
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,840
Do you hear me?

859
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,040
Princess of the Chief.

860
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,720
Every day, the three of us don't leave the Princess of the Chief.

861
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,960
Are we the Princess of the Chief?

862
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,880
What... What are you talking about?

863
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,880
You think everything you have now

864
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,320
is the Princess of the Chief.

865
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,400
Then how can I

866
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,720
pay for the court and the emperor

867
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,680
for all these years?

868
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,840
The food and drink we eat and drink

869
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,800
are all the food and drink I have

870
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,840
changed to the Princess of the Chief.

871
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,560
It's not the Princess of the Chief.

872
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,400
Mother cares about you.

873
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,600
She is afraid that you will be misled

874
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,720
and you will be eliminated.

875
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,280
You remind me every day and night.

876
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,400
How dare I

877
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,120
to mislead you?

878
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,640
I will understand what you mean.

879
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,080
The result of the election of the Crown Prince is out.

880
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,800
It's out.

881
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,120
Ye Shijie,

882
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,320
Liu Xu and I

883
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,320
have been criticized.

884
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,040
The four of us can be together again.

885
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,200
What's wrong?

886
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,520
A Li didn't receive the tomorrow.

887
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,080
He didn't receive it?

888
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,960
He is the best among us.

889
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,000
He won't be criticized.

890
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:11,920
Idiot.

891
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,120
He said he didn't receive the tomorrow.

892
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,000
Even if he didn't receive it,

893
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,440
he will remember the post.

894
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,040
If A Li didn't receive the tomorrow,

895
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,920
he would be lost.

896
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,600
He won't be lost.

897
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,280
He is still in the decision to come to the Shen School.

898
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,640
What do you mean?

899
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,720
I want to ask you for a favor.

900
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,600
What?

901
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,520
I want him to come to Jiang's house

902
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,440
and ask for my permission.

903
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,640
Your Majesty.

904
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,160
I have arranged the day

905
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,520
of the Li Dai Zhao Group.

906
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,720
It's like

907
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,400
I have invited the outside members of the Ministry of Revenue

908
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,520
and Ye Shijie to come here.

909
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,640
I will leave now.

910
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,320
Okay.

911
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:45,960
Your Majesty.

912
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,800
I have a bold suggestion.

913
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,920
Jiang Erniang is good at

914
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,280
making the way to Li Hua Bai.

915
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,040
It's a long way from here.

916
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,000
If Jiang Erniang

917
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,920
is in the reception group,

918
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,400
he will play a song for the Zhao Group

919
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,560
at the banquet.

920
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,040
I will play a song for the Zhao Group.

921
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,360
I will play a song for the Zhao Group.

922
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,360
I will play a song for the Zhao Group.

923
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,600
I will play a song for the Zhao Group.

924
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,600
I will play a song for the Zhao Group.

925
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,560
I will play a song for the Zhao Group.

926
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,920
I will play a song for the Zhao Group.

927
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,960
I will play a song for the Zhao Group.

928
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,160
I will play a song for the Zhao Group.

929
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,280
I have heard the song a few times.

930
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,600
It has always been

931
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,000
a great example of

932
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,920
the Li Hua Bai.

933
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,840
When I was at the banquet,

934
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,640
I wanted to let it play a song for the Zhao Group.

935
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,800
It's a pity that I have the evidence.

936
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
I have left early.

937
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,240
Shen Qing is here at the moment of the time.

938
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,480
What do you think?

939
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,360
Your Majesty.

940
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,680
It's a great song.

941
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,920
There is no Jiang Erniang

942
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,080
in the reception room of the banquet.

943
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,680
Is she missing her head or her body?

944
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,040
really recited the name of theEarth in order to mix.

945
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,760
It's just that I think

946
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,720
the thing happened to Jiang Jia

947
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,160
has steadily been killed.

948
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,360
Shen Qing feels

949
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,080
Jiang Erniang is guilty.

950
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,880
What Jiang Jia did is a���.

951
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,680
It's not right for a strange interesting people

952
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,280
to discuss through public interests.

953
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,840
Shen Qing Motorship

954
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,040
I'm ashamed.

955
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,920
Outside the smoke truck.

956
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,200
I'll just use the name of Miss Jiang Er.

957
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,840
You and her are a couple.

958
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,680
You can take the position as the transfer.

959
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,080
Shen Xueshi,

960
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,840
I'm not good at taking the position as the transfer.

961
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,480
Moreover, you never used the name of her.

962
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,520
I'm afraid Miss Jiang Er will misunderstand you.

963
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,320
If you don't go,

964
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,600
how can I explain it?

965
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,120
Madam, you really are as good as a god.

966
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,000
Shen Xueshi really came to see you.

967
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,800
He's just outside.

968
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,440
No matter how late I am,

969
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,760
how can Shen Xueshi come to me?

970
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,880
I have a favor to ask you today.

971
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,880
Today, I stopped at the banquet.

972
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,880
The emperor suddenly mentioned

973
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,320
that he wants to hear Miss Jiang Er's

974
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,600
story about the falling of the flower petals.

975
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,760
The falling of the flower petals.

976
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,160
I've played this song

977
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,200
in the Sui family in the Mingyi Hall.

978
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,720
I didn't expect His Majesty to be so kind.

979
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,840
Miss Jiang Er's love story

980
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,760
has already been spread in the capital.

981
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,000
It's hard to avoid the public's comments.

982
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,920
Miss Jiang Er is the only one who is hiding the wind.

983
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,720
The falling of the flower petals is a joke.

984
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,160
Now the great Zhao's envoy is here to meet me.

985
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,480
It's not easy to play this song.

986
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,560
So I'd like to ask Miss Jiang Er to play the song

987
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,120
and end this matter.

988
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,040
I know what you mean.

989
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,200
I know what you mean.

990
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,840
People who don't know what to do

991
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,520
really think that

992
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,840
you're not good at studying.

993
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,000
You're so thoughtful.

994
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,400
You're so thoughtful.

995
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,800
I just think

996
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,800
Miss Jiang Er is wise.

997
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,920
That's why I came to beg for your forgiveness.

998
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,760
If Miss Jiang Er doesn't want to,

999
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,160
I will ask His Majesty to give me his permission.

1000
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,920
I'm sorry for today.

1001
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,760
I'll take my leave.

1002
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,720
Shen Xue Shi.

1003
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,320
What are you afraid of?

1004
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,320
What do you mean by this?

1005
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,440
If you don't want me to pick a substitute,

1006
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,360
you can take back my reputation.

1007
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,760
But you don't have the right to take it back.

1008
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,320
Are you hesitating?

1009
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,280
What am I hesitating about?

1010
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,800
You should know.

1011
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,040
After all, your intention is too obvious.

1012
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,400
My intention?

1013
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,280
Shen Xue Shi, did you misunderstand anything?

1014
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,800
You can hide it from others.

1015
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,120
You can't hide it from me.

1016
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,480
Shen Xue Shi.

1017
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,560
I should say you're stupid.

1018
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,040
Or you're self-reliant?

1019
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,760
It seems that Shen Xue Shi

1020
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,120
is still treating me as your old friend.

1021
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,760
Since you're so stubborn,

1022
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,240
why did you

1023
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,080
oppose me in front of the Imperial Palace?

1024
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,880
You should know it very well.

1025
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,680
I

1026
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,520
was the Emperor's minister of the Central Academy's

1027
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,960
master of the Imperial Academy.

1028
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,040
Not your royal wife.

1029
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,840
Even if I can be like her as a real person,

1030
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,920
what can I do?

1031
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,920
Since that,

1032
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,240
why did you have to

1033
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,240
go to my ring?

1034
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,480
The maid around me

1035
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,040
died for me.

1036
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,760
I'm like her sister.

1037
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,840
I'm sad.

1038
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,800
I'm sad.

1039
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,400
I can't control myself.

1040
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,520
I just want to have a good time

1041
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,720
at the meeting of the high-ranking board.

1042
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,640
Am I right?

1043
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,800
Shen Xue Shi

1044
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,800
is going to take back my reputation.

1045
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,880
Please don't

1046
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,160
put your feelings

1047
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,800
on me.

1048
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,800
Instead, find a reason

1049
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,120
to make people happy.

1050
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,080
Otherwise, the others will think

1051
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,360
you're guilty.

1052
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,160
You should go, Shen Xue Shi.

1053
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,160
Shen Xue Shi

1054
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,320
is the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1055
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1056
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1057
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1058
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1059
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1060
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1061
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1062
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1063
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1064
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1065
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1066
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1067
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,320
He's the most important person in the Imperial Palace.

1068
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,180
parappa

1069
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,400
Son.

1070
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,420
Mother.

1071
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,460
Shen Ji thisanyu

1072
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,780
how can you

1073
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,260
to have the perfect gift

1074
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,680
with your.

1075
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,680
For a beautifulになHow would

1076
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,680
it look as if we are all the wirders?

1077
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,120
You really hurt my heart.

1078
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,240
Unfortunately, I can't take care of you anymore.

1079
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,440
The maid around me died to protect me.

1080
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,520
I'm like my sister to her.

1081
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,040
I just want to have a hot drink at the meeting of the high-ranking man.

1082
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,080
The maid is here.

1083
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,080
She's here.

1084
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,080
She's here.

1085
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,080

She's here.

1111
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,480
I'm here.

1112
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,480
She's here.

1113
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,480
She's here.
