1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I have a two-way solution.

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What is it?

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
From today on,

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I am Jiang Li.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What?

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Anyway, in the past ten years,

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Jiang Li has never been out of the True Maiden Hall.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Ten years?

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What does she look like?

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Others have long forgotten.

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You are the one who took over the True Maiden Hall.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You have been ordered to do so.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Who dares not to obey?

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But...

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What do you know?

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The dead camel is bigger than the horse.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
She is the daughter of the Grand Preceptor of the Central Command.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Better than me, the daughter of the village head.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Maybe the Jiang family will remember me one day.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Then I can enjoy the glory and wealth.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Deal?

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Chief.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Will she still not get up?

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Tell everyone.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't worry about Jiang Li.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
She will rest here for seven days.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then let her be.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let her be.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I will be here.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I will be here.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Are going to spend the rest here.

41
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,460
Follow the wind andukes

42
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,220
Flowing to the end of the universe

43
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,380
My easily going to scent

44
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,240
Go wide open

45
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,840
I want to ask

46
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,220
a question

47
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:33,220
If I can meet you, it will be more comfortable

48
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,220
I'm willing to go home with her

49
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Tong'er

50
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,820
Tong'er

51
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,820
What are you doing?

52
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,220
If it wasn't for you, my wife wouldn't have died

53
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,620
I didn't expect you, ungrateful woman, to take her identity

54
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,620
Today, I'm going to kill you to avenge my wife

55
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,020
Tong'er

56
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,020
Tong'er

57
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,020
Tong'er

58
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,620
Do you think it's enough to kill me and Master Tang?

59
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,620
Those who sent Li Yao to Zhenli Hall

60
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,620
Those who didn't ask her for ten years

61
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,620
Do you think they will feel sorry for her?

62
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,620
They won't

63
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,620
They won't

64
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,620
They will only cry and throw the dead body away

65
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,620
Then they will be free in the high door

66
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,620
Is this what you want?

67
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,620
Your wife will die for nothing

68
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,620
Master

69
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,620
Master will be the master for my wife

70
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,620
Master will be the master for my wife

71
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,620
I

72
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,620
Master

73
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,620
I've been thinking about her for ten years

74
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,620
I didn't ask her about her daughter

75
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Now she's dead

76
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,620
I'm relieved that she's the master

77
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,620
What can I do as a master?

78
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,620
I sealed Zhenli Hall

79
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,620
I took Li Yao's body back to the grave

80
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,620
I let her bury the ashes

81
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,620
What about going back?

82
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,620
I'll give her a good name

83
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,620
A name that doesn't care about her future

84
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
Tong'er

85
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,620
I do need Jiang Li's identity

86
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,620
What do you want to do?

87
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,620
Jiang Li and I are living in the dark

88
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,620
No one believes us

89
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,620
Li Yao trusts me

90
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,620
I trust her too

91
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,620
But now

92
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,620
Li Yao is dead

93
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,620
She can't change herself

94
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,620
I'll change for her

95
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
They think

96
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,620
we live in the dark forever

97
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,620
Let them see

98
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,620
how you and I

99
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,620
hide in the dark

100
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,620
and escape

101
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,620
Clean it up

102
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,620
every corner

103
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,620
Especially under the tree

104
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,620
You need to cheer up

105
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,620
Clean up the Zhenli Hall

106
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,620
Everyone needs to do

107
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,620
their job

108
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,620
Tong'er

109
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,620
Tong'er

110
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
Why did you come out?

111
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,620
It's hard for you

112
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,620
to do your job alone

113
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,620
I'll go with you tomorrow

114
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,620
The master said

115
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,620
you can't come out

116
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,620
I'll never touch it

117
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,620
Don't be so Dang

118
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,620
I'll never touch it

119
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,620
I said you crazy

120
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,620
I'll let the master see it

121
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
I'll never touch it

122
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,620
You can't

123
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,620
You can't

124
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,620
You can't

125
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,620
You can't

126
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,620
What are you doing?

127
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,620
I can't

128
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,060
Only the Hall Leader can touch it.

129
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,100
You're so disobedient.

130
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,060
You're so ignorant.

131
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,380
Stop looking. Let's go.

132
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,620
If they find out,

133
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,380
why can't the lantern be moved?

134
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,660
Zhen Nv Hall has rules.

135
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,180
You can't light the lantern at night.

136
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,300
Only outside the ancestral hall can light the lantern.

137
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,580
So only the Hall Leader of Zhen Nv Hall can light the lantern.

138
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,260
No one else can move it.

139
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,100
The four types of women.

140
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,500
One is the one who is good.

141
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,100
Two is the one who is strict.

142
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,820
Three is the one who is gentle.

143
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,820
Four is the one who is good at making contributions.

144
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,300
Five is the one who is good at making contributions.

145
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,180
Your female skills are not bad.

146
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,500
You've practiced a lot in your daily life.

147
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,980
In a few days,

148
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,140
I will do my best to tell everyone that you are Jiang Li.

149
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,020
Then you can appear in front of everyone.

150
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,220
Thank you, Hall Leader.

151
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,020
Give it to me.

152
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,460
Give it to me…

153
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,540
This one is mine.

154
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,940
Give block to them when they see me.

155
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,580
Do you feel unwell?

156
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,780
I'm okay now.

157
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,500
Jiaxian has got the upper hand

158
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,620
and is making decisions about the height of the Phantom Ninth.

159
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,940
He is DOING lawfully questioning about storefront.

160
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,100
He doesn't even think about the target about the staff's interests.

161
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,660
As long as you're obedient,

162
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,660
you'll have a meal.

163
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,460
I'll listen to you.

164
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,420
Master.

165
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,660
You're in disguise today.

166
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,780
Don't talk too much.

167
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,340
Master, take care.

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,500
There's nothing wrong in it!

169
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,260
Yes.

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,760
Look!

171
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,640
It's anback!

172
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:09,940
One moment you need follows one day concentrate you come long

173
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:29,300
Uniqueness to

174
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
I didn't get a chance to escape.

175
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,140
I'm afraid it's harder now.

176
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Where are you going?

177
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,640
I want to go out and take a breath.

178
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,140
No.

179
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,640
It's not a good time to go out.

180
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
You're going to get beaten up.

181
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,140
Everyone is sleeping now.

182
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
I'll take a break.

183
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
I don't think I'll be caught.

184
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,640
The True Daughter Hall has a rule that you can't go out late at night.

185
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,140
Because

186
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,640
there was a real woman

187
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
who sneaked out late at night to meet her lover.

188
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,640
She fell off the cliff and died.

189
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,640
But she kept her soul with her.

190
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
She was entangled in the True Daughter Hall all night.

191
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,140
Then there was another real woman.

192
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,640
She sneaked out late at night.

193
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Then she met that woman.

194
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
She was scared to death.

195
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,140
I'm afraid it's not because I don't want you to go out.

196
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
You're just making up things.

197
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,140
No, it's true.

198
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,640
That woman remember it clearly.

199
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,640
That woman also wore the clothes of the real woman.

200
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,140
And they are tall.

201
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
It's scary.

202
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
It's scary.

203
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Tall and female ghost.

204
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Three days later

205
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Mrs. Liu, who will attend the monthly court

206
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
will come to feed the True Daughter Hall.

207
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
Because the journey is long

208
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Mrs. Liu will stay here for a night.

209
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
These days, you have to tell her

210
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,640
to clean up the True Daughter Hall.

211
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
So Mrs. Liu can live comfortably.

212
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
I know.

213
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
When Mrs. Liu comes

214
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
let them two have a good time.

215
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
Don't go out at will.

216
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
In case you get the wrong idea.

217
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
Yes.

218
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
The wife of the Deputy Minister of Revenue, Liu Yuanfeng.

219
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Tong.

220
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
You know Mrs. Liu?

221
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
If I remember correctly

222
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,640
she was a good friend of Mrs. Ye.

223
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
The hairpin on your head

224
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,640
was also given to Mrs. Ye by her.

225
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
I don't know.

226
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
She was with Mrs. Ye.

227
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Mrs. Liu, you have a long journey.

228
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
I'm here to help you.

229
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
How can I be tired?

230
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
Greetings, Mrs. Liu.

231
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,640
The True Daughter Hall is well-organized.

232
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
The owner of the Hall of Ten Swords is very considerate.

233
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
I came here in a hurry.

234
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
I'm afraid I disturbed you.

235
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
How dare you.

236
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
We are very grateful for Mrs. Liu's visit.

237
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Prime Minister is well-prepared.

238
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
I hope Mrs. Jiang can accept this.

239
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Please Bravo!

240
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Tong?

241
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Tong?

242
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Wake up.

243
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Tonight

244
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,680
is the only chance for us to leave here.

245
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,520
How?

246
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,000
Mrs. Liu.

247
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,960
But Mrs. Liu

248
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,040
always knows that you're in Zhennv Hall.

249
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,480
She doesn't come to say hello to you.

250
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,640
Besides, if the Jiang family doesn't say anything,

251
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,920
can she take us away?

252
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,080
Give this hairpin

253
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,080
to Mrs. Liu.

254
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,520
Can it work?

255
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,880
Tell Mrs. Liu

256
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,360
that there's a disaster in the Jiang family.

257
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,920
She'll come with you

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,120
when she sees this hairpin.

259
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,160
But now,

260
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,360
all the people in Zhennv Hall

261
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,760
are the masters of the Hall.

262
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,080
Even if Mrs. Liu is willing to help us,

263
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
what if the Hall owner doesn't recognize us

264
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,120
and bites us?

265
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,160
If Mrs. Liu

266
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
sees it with her own eyes,

267
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,320
the Hall owner will be in a bad mood.

268
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,680
You mean...

269
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,040
Have you ever smelled

270
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,520
the fragrance of the Hall owner?

271
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,880
She's using the powder every day.

272
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,040
What's so strange about that?

273
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,680
Is it every day

274
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,040
or occasionally?

275
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,400
It doesn't seem to be every day.

276
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,000
That's right.

277
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,640
When I first smelled the fragrance of the Hall owner

278
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,600
during the female festival,

279
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,760
it wasn't an ordinary fragrance.

280
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,280
It was...

281
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,800
Yilan incense.

282
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,200
Yilan incense?

283
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,000
It's used to make love between couples.

284
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,920
How...

285
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,120
How did you know?

286
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,800
Madam,

287
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,680
I saw that the master didn't come to see you these days.

288
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,360
I prepared something for you.

289
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,560
What's this?

290
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Yilan incense.

291
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,880
When the Hall owner smells the fragrance of love,

292
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,400
the lantern will appear at the height of tonight.

293
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,400
If the Hall owner doesn't smell the incense,

294
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,240
the lantern won't be so high.

295
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,080
So the lantern has a meaning.

296
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
Near the Hall of True Maid,

297
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,920
is there a Spirit-gathering Cove?

298
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,880
Yes.

299
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,200
On the opposite hill.

300
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,000
When I was helping you with the firewood,

301
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,800
I went to the direction of the Spirit-gathering Cove.

302
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,600
I found that when the lantern was hanging at a high position,

303
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,920
the lantern could be seen on the hill.

304
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,240
But when the lantern was at a low position,

305
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,600
it couldn't be seen.

306
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,880
I went to the Spirit-gathering Cove to smell the incense.

307
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,760
There will be a meeting every night.

308
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,960
When there is a meeting,

309
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,840
the Hall owner will smell the incense of love.

310
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,840
At this time,

311
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,040
the lantern will be seen on the hill.

312
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,280
What does it mean?

313
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,360
It means that the lantern

314
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,840
is for the people who attend the meeting.

315
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,840
Yes.

316
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,080
But what does it mean?

317
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,440
Is it just a coincidence?

318
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,160
It's not a coincidence.

319
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,400
One day,

320
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,560
I went to pick the fruit while they were out.

321
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,760
I deliberately lowered the lantern.

322
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,000
Guess what?

323
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,120
That night,

324
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
I thought something must have happened.

325
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,040
When you were asleep,

326
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,240
I sneaked out.

327
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,520
Then I met the one you mentioned,

328
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,480
the High-Leveled Witch.

329
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,400
The High-Leveled Witch

330
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,760
Ruo Ye can't go out.

331
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,120
The Ghost of the Goddess.

332
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,360
It turns out that all this was to control us

333
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,520
and let her act on her own.

334
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,680
But if we were caught in the Hall of the Goddess,

335
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,320
we would be locked up.

336
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,560
And there is a court meeting at the Hall of the Holy Spirit.

337
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,000
How dare the Hall owner call out when Mrs. Liu came?

338
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,200
I hung the lantern.

339
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,760
Sister, you are so great.

340
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,320
I'll go find Mrs. Liu now.

341
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:24,960
Tong Er.

342
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,320
Go find Mrs. Liu.

343
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,880
You need a reason

344
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
besides for hairpin.

345
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,800
Do it.

346
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,480
No.

347
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,520
There's no need to do it.

348
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,360
We don't have a chance.

349
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,200
I don't have the scar from Jiang Li.

350
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,960
We need to act as a group

351
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,120
to clear our suspicion.

352
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,760
For Jiang Li,

353
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,040
we must do it.

354
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Chu этом

355
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,400
Chu em

356
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,000
Chu sem

357
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,160
Chu subm

358
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,360
Chu em

359
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Chu sem

360
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,280
Chu

361
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
Chu

362
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,940
Chugen

363
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,920
The True Maiden Hall is ahead.

364
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
True Maiden Hall?

365
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
It's closed to women who can't go down the mountain.

366
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
It's indeed a good place to hide.

367
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Who is it?

368
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
Come out.

369
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Come out.

370
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Come out.

371
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,360
Lady Nv.

372
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,040
I was harmed by someone.

373
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
Lady Nv, please help me.

374
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,320
This is not the Buddha Hall.

375
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,640
I'm not a Bodhisattva.

376
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
If you hide here,

377
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,640
you'll be found sooner or later.

378
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,120
Behind that window is the back mountain forest.

379
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Hurry up.

380
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
Let's go.

381
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Thank you.

382
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
Come here again.

383
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
I'll kill him.

384
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Kill him.

385
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
You can add another murder charge.

386
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Lady Nv.

387
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Childe Qin.

388
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,520
Stop saving Qin.

389
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,040
You can't escape the crime of selling your own salt.

390
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
You can't escape the crime of selling your own salt.

391
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
You can't escape the crime of selling your own salt.

392
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
You can't escape the crime of selling your own salt.

393
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
I don't understand what you're saying.

394
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,640
You told me where the salt came from.

395
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
You made my master chase me to this place.

396
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
If he can't explain it clearly,

397
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,120
even if the God King comes,

398
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
he can't save you.

399
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Don't praise me.

400
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
If you have it,

401
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
what good will it do?

402
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,120
If you don't let me go today,

403
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,920
I'll die anyway.

404
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Why don't you die here?

405
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,040
There's a beauty on the way to the netherworld.

406
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,120
I'm kind-hearted.

407
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,520
If you think so,

408
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,120
I'll do as you wish.

409
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
I'll let you and your beauty

410
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,720
reunite in the netherworld.

411
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Madam.

412
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,520
My wife is dying.

413
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,120
Please save my wife.

414
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,120
This is the hairpin I gave Zhenzhen.

415
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Could it be...

416
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
Li?

417
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Yes.

418
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,120
Hurry up. Take me to her.

419
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Okay.

420
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Let's go.

421
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Li.

422
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Lord.

423
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,520
How about we give up?

424
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
What are you talking about?

425
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
I said,

426
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,320
how about we give up?

427
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Duke Su

428
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,520
has already caught Zhen Nv.

429
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
Now,

430
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,920
he caught you and me on the spot.

431
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,520
What else can we say?

432
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
You bitch.

433
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

434
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,320
What does the person above mean?

435
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,120
He pushed us to the dead end.

436
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,720
Let me go first.

437
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
Let's

438
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,720
confess to Duke Su.

439
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,920
Maybe we can still live.

440
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,320
Who are you?

441
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
My dear.

442
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,120
I'm your accomplice.

443
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
Do it.

444
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
What are you talking about?

445
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,520
You've been fighting for a long time.

446
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,920
You're colleagues.

447
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
You should kill her.

448
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
After you kill her,

449
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,320
I'll take you away.

450
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,920
I want to see

451
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
how you clean up the gate.

452
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,320
I'll kill her now.

453
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,320
No.

454
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
I'll kill her.

455
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Get up.

456
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
Get up.

457
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Chu Jun.

458
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
Look at her.

459
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,320
Isn't she familiar?

460
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
My dear.

461
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Look at this cloth.

462
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
My dear.

463
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,920
Someone is looking at you upstairs.

464
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,520
It's hard to buy other things.

465
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,620
What does the picture say?

466
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,220
Pink is needed.

467
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,720
How come there is none?

468
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:46,160
There is someone else in the picture at

469
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,720
It's not a good thing to be targeted by him.

470
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,600
Let's go.

471
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,960
Don't tell me your surname is Xue.

472
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
You've got the wrong person.

473
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
That's right.

474
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
You're dead.

475
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Why are you still here?

476
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
You're a thief.

477
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
You're unbelievable.

478
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Let me go.

479
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Let me go.

480
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
Don't listen to this crazy woman.

481
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
I'm innocent.

482
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
You've got the wrong person.

483
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Let me go.

484
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
Let me go.

485
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Let me go.

486
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
You're so annoying.

487
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Take him back.

488
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,960
Lock him up.

489
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Guards.

490
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
I'll interrogate you here today.

491
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
After the interrogation,

492
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,960
I'll tell your management to take you back.

493
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Get up.

494
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Duke Su, don't you like me?

495
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
You're so rude.

496
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
A woman in Zhennv Hall

497
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
can't do anything that's against the law?

498
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
I know

499
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
that you're not as good as that woman.

500
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Why don't you take her back to the capital?

501
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
Why don't you take me?

502
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
You want me to lock you up?

503
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
You're interesting.

504
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
In this place,

505
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Duke Su can't torture me.

506
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Don't you think it's not fair?

507
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
Li'er.

508
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Are you in there?

509
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Li'er.

510
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
If we didn't come in today,

511
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,960
you want to sing another song, right?

512
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Are you saying that you're not a good singer?

513
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,960
Take me back to the capital to interrogate.

514
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
I'll understand everything.

515
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Which song did you want to sing?

516
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,960
Can you sing it today?

517
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Duke Su wants to see it?

518
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
You're here.

519
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Tie me up.

520
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Take me out.

521
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
I'll sing it for you.

522
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
My lady, why are you tied up?

523
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Don't touch her.

524
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,960
She's now Duke Su's prisoner.

525
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
What's going on?

526
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960
What's going on?

527
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Mrs. Liu, right?

528
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
Duke Su.

529
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
I've been pursuing the court's criminals so far.

530
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Or this woman and the prisoner have a conspiracy.

531
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
Now this woman,

532
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
I want to take her back to the capital to interrogate.

533
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Duke Su,

534
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
there must be some misunderstanding here.

535
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
Tong'er.

536
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Tong'er.

537
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
This lady is...

538
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
My lady.

539
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,960
This is Mrs. Liu who used to come to see you and your wife when you were little.

540
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
It's actually Mrs. Liu.

541
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Mrs. Liu, you're really...

542
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
Mrs. Liu.

543
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Help me.

544
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,960
I'm not a prisoner's accomplice.

545
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
I was framed.

546
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,960
I'm innocent.

547
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
I don't want to be taken back to the capital to interrogate.

548
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
Help me.

549
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Okay, okay, okay.

550
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,960
Don't worry.

551
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Duke Su,

552
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
how can you arrest people at will?

553
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
This is the Hall of True Daughters.

554
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Just taking the real daughter away from the Hall,

555
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
and not telling the Hall Master about it,

556
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
isn't that a little inappropriate?

557
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Aunt Liu,

558
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
please help me beg the Hall Master

559
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
to let him speak for me.

560
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Don't be afraid.

561
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
I'll go find the Hall Master now

562
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
and let him speak for you.

563
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
I'll wait for you here,

564
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Mrs. Liu.

565
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Okay.

566
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Why are you here?

567
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
You hung the lantern high.

568
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
I naturally came.

569
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Lantern?

570
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
Not now.

571
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
A noble man is coming.

572
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Hurry up and go.

573
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Get up.

574
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
Hurry up and go.

575
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
I'm here.

576
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,960
I've seen it.

577
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
There's no one outside.

578
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Let go.

579
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Let go.

580
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Madam Jun.

581
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Madam Jun.

582
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,960
ommen lle.

583
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Yes?

584
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Where?!

585
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
Get power.

586
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
Madam Liu!

587
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Hurry and take her down!

588
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Madam Liu!

589
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Hurry!

590
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
Kneel!

591
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,960
This is the first time I've seen someone who is the master being carried here.

592
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
This Mount Qingchen really opens my eyes.

593
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Madam Liu, I was framed!

594
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
I saw it with my own eyes.

595
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Do you still want to deny it in front of Duke Su?

596
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
I don't care about the dirty things here.

597
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Please do as you please.

598
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Guards!

599
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Wake up all the maids!

600
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Leave two open-door maids.

601
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Take them all back!

602
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,960
Tomorrow, report to the government and let the government investigate.

603
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
These two scoundrels are not as good as before.

604
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
I can tell that they are in a bad mood.

605
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Take them away now!

606
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Yes!

607
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
It's not like that!

608
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
It's not like that!

609
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
Madam Liu!

610
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
You're framing me!

611
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Madam Liu!

612
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
Madam Liu!

613
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Madam Liu, can I take my prisoner away?

614
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Mother!

615
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,960
Chu Jun, she's injured.

616
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
What should we do now?

617
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Take her away or...

618
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Find a room for her to rest.

619
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,960
Also, you...

620
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Come here.

621
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Check on this girl.

622
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Yes.

623
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
What?

624
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
What's wrong?

625
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,960
What's wrong?

626
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
What's wrong?

627
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
What's wrong?

628
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
What's wrong?

629
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
What's wrong?

630
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
What's wrong?

631
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
What's wrong?

632
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
You finally woke up.

633
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Madam Liu, I'm tired.

634
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,960
You've suffered a lot.

635
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,960
How did you get hurt like this?

636
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
Don't move.

637
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Are you still dizzy?

638
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Lie down for a while.

639
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
How did you get this injury?

640
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,960
I know that you're not going to tell me.

641
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,960
It must be the woman who tortured you.

642
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,960
That maid came to me with a hairpin.

643
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,960
When I saw the hairpin, I knew that you were in trouble.

644
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,960
If your mother knew that you suffered such a crime here,

645
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
she would be so heartbroken.

646
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,960
Madam Liu, it's okay.

647
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
It's all in the past.

648
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,960
I'm already content to see Madam Liu this time.

649
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,960
I just don't know if Duke Su will...

650
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Li'er, don't worry.

651
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Although I can't take you away from Duke Su,

652
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,960
I will make the Jiang family take you away from him.

653
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Just wait.

654
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Hurry.

655
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
Hurry up.

656
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
Don't follow me.

657
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,960
I heard that Duke Su is good at forcing people to share.

658
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,960
But I have to remind you that this woman is the daughter of the Prime Minister.

659
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,960
If I find anything wrong with her,

660
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
I will report it to the Prime Minister.

661
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Will the Jiang family still care about her?

662
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
If the Jiang family doesn't care about her,

663
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,960
then the court can't control Duke Su.

664
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Madam Liu is quite good.

665
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
Let's talk about business.

666
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Business is about people.

667
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
Should we take her away?

668
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,960
Let her rest for a night before leaving.

669
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,960
So that people won't say that I treat criminals.

670
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,960
But Mr. Qin has already taken her away.

671
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,960
The criminals are different from the criminals.

672
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
Prepare a paper and pen.

673
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
I want to write a letter.

674
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,960
I also want to have fun in this Zhen Nv Hall.

675
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Yes.

676
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Tong'er.

677
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Sister, I'm sorry.

678
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,960
I told you about my sister's self-harm.

679
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,960
I'm really useless.

680
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,960
It's okay.

681
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
It's not important now.

682
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Sister, what's wrong with Duke Su?

683
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
It's an accident.

684
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
I heard it from outside.

685
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,960
They said they would take my sister back to the capital to be interrogated.

686
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
Isn't that good?

687
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,960
We can go to the capital after we get the chance.

688
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,960
But sister, even if we can go back to the capital,

689
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
we can't go back to the Jiang family.

690
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,960
And will Madam Liu really go to the Jiang family?

691
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
Madam Liu doesn't need to go to the Jiang family.

692
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,960
The marriage between Tang and the people has already given Duke Liu a word of speech in the court.

693
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,960
As long as this matter is put in front of the emperor in the court,

694
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,960
the Jiang family will have to remember this lost daughter for ten years.

695
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
The Jiang family is afraid of the high position.

696
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,960
They are not willing to fall into a heartless and ungrateful name.

697
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,960
So whether the Jiang family is willing to take Jiang Li home,

698
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,960
they will not only do it, but also do it in a grand way.

699
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Did you sleep well last night?

700
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
Duke Su didn't sleep well last night.

701
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
Duke Su didn't sleep well last night.

702
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,960
After thinking about it for a night, what is your last name?

703
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Duke Su, didn't you ask Madam Liu?

704
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Madam Liu said that you seem to be called...

705
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Li Hua?

706
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
Li Mao?

707
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Li Mao?

708
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Duke Su, please be self-cultivated.

709
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,960
This is the first time I've heard a prisoner teach me self-cultivation.

710
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,960
You are too uneducated.

711
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
How about this?

712
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,960
Yesterday, you were so cruel to your own back.

713
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Today, you are so skilled.

714
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,960
You are so unlucky.

715
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Duke Su, you are not afraid of people who are hard-working, are you?

716
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
I'm leaving.

717
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,960
Sister.

718
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,960
West and西 tournickers

719
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:42,860
That pretty pretty

720
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:47,640
are fraternity and familiar joys together in a life of Products.

721
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:56,780
I'm willing to come home with him.

722
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,160
I promise to earn a good 72 million.

723
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,640
For Your Majesty's benefit,

724
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,740
I am willing to go with you.

725
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,040
I, I beg of you.

726
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,780
Please appear with me some next time.

727
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,080
Sure!

728
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,840
Goddess of everlasting beauty.

729
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,240
I am répahing for you.

730
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,260
Do you look scared?

731
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,800
I, I am ok.

732
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,960
Let me help bédé light a arrangements stone.

733
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,080
Here's gong warm tea.

734
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,560
Ok.

735
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,440
You did such a good job.

736
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,800
You're really a capable official.

737
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,880
Your Majesty,

738
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,880
I was too careless

739
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,280
to take care of my wife.

740
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,400
I was hurt.

741
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,160
I had to go back to my mother's house

742
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,360
to deal with the funeral.

743
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,880
I'm afraid that

744
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,000
you can't go to the mountain.

745
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,960
I'm afraid of being late.

746
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,240
Please forgive me.

747
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
People know the long-term.

748
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,560
What's the crime?

749
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,000
Shen Qing and Wang Qi are close to each other.

750
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,840
They are very filial to their families.

751
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,680
They are our role models.

752
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,200
The officials in the court should take this as an example.

753
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,240
If there is a love between a husband and wife,

754
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,320
and a filial son,

755
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,600
they should also be recommended

756
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,040
as the most important thing in the court.

757
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

758
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,800
Jiang Qing.

759
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

760
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,160
How's the progress on the cultivation?

761
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,000
Empress Dowager Xia's spirit zither has been completed.

762
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,760
Only three rooms are left.

763
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,120
I totally fell in love!

764
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:35,080
In a aggi 큐

765
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,520
Each room has to be cleaned.

766
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
Which room?

767
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,920
Palace of edge 자orie

768
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,760
is a row with holding 저�

769
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
You may rise.

770
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,760
Your Majesty.

771
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,260
I just learned from the Ministry of Works.

772
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:04,760
This time, the repair of the mausoleum is very empty.

773
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,760
Your Majesty, last month, the capital was in a heat wave.

774
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,760
I saw that someone fell down from the mausoleum.

775
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,260
I had to stop the project.

776
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,260
But the period of the mausoleum cannot be wasted.

777
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,260
The only way to get the workers out of the city is to drive them out.

778
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,260
It's more likely to drive people out of the city south.

779
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,260
To attack the workers.

780
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,260
There must be a way.

781
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,260
But how can it be slandered as empty?

782
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,760
They say the secretary of the central office loves the people like a chicken.

783
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,260
It's not true.

784
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,260
But repairing the mausoleum is a key issue in the court.

785
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,760
Not to mention the people's words.

786
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,260
Which one of the officials is not looking at this?

787
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,260
It's not a small matter to change the budget of the Ministry of Works.

788
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,260
Prime Minister Jiang is alone in the prison.

789
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,260
But he was shocked. I remind you.

790
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,260
What's the matter with you?

791
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,260
Prime Minister Li.

792
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,260
Prime Minister Jiang.

793
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,260
Enough.

794
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,260
After you get the mausoleum, you can get it back.

795
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,260
You don't have to argue.

796
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,260
Yes.

797
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,260
Liu Qing.

798
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,260
Yes.

799
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,260
The Mausoleum of Qingcheng Mountain is not a place for the officials to live.

800
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,260
It's not a school for the officials to live in.

801
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,260
But I heard that in recent years,

802
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,260
the officials in the capital have donated a lot of food and clothing to that place.

803
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,260
Such a place.

804
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,260
Such a ridiculous and ugly thing happened.

805
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,260
Your Majesty.

806
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,260
The lady in the family went to the Mausoleum to ask.

807
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,260
She saw it last night.

808
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,260
The Minister of the Central Office ordered the daughter to be a witness.

809
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,260
This is definitely not fake.

810
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,260
The Minister of the Central Office ordered the daughter to be a witness.

811
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,260
Why is the daughter in the Mausoleum?

812
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,260
Your Majesty.

813
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,260
My daughter made a big mistake before.

814
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,260
So I sent her to the Mausoleum to rest.

815
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,260
Prime Minister Jiang.

816
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,260
This should be your family affair.

817
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,260
I shouldn't ask.

818
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,260
The other child was sent to the mountain.

819
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,260
It's a long time ago.

820
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,260
You haven't received it back?

821
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,260
Thank you for your advice.

822
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,260
I will handle my family affairs properly.

823
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:21,260
I also hope that your daughter will be reunited soon.

824
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,260
With the last report,

825
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,260
I don't think it's strange that Duke Su participated in this.

826
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,260
The real daughter of the Mausoleum

827
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,260
colluded with the fugitives who sold the salt.

828
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,260
They hid the fugitives and hid the money.

829
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,260
It's unforgivable.

830
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,260
I ordered Duke Su to investigate this matter thoroughly.

831
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,260
No matter who is involved behind it,

832
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,260
I will never give up.

833
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,260
It's a good time to warm up.

834
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,260
These dishes

835
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,260
are for the master and the old lady.

836
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,260
I will go to the Mausoleum

837
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,260
and use the wild ducks

838
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,260
to make soup

839
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,260
with the horse and the yellow flag.

840
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,260
How to say,

841
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,260
the taste of the master and the old lady

842
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,260
is the most accurate.

843
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,260
It's just that I took care of it delicately

844
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,260
to make everyone have a good taste.

845
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,260
Go and prepare it.

846
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,260
Yes.

847
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,260
Master.

848
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,260
Husband.

849
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,260
Why are you so hasty?

850
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,260
I will take Jiang Li back immediately.

851
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,260
Why?

852
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,260
Why did you suddenly say this?

853
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,260
Today, His Majesty ordered two reports.

854
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,260
One is from Liu Yuanfeng.

855
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,260
One is from Duke Su.

856
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,260
Duke Liu

857
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,260
actually brought this matter

858
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,260
to His Majesty's eyes

859
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,260
and made you lose face for nothing.

860
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:05,260
Who is Liu Yuanfeng?

861
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,260
Your father was the one who put his own people in the court

862
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,260
and took his way of life.

863
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,260
With this opportunity,

864
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,260
can he not participate in the Jiang family?

865
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,260
He was so lucky.

866
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,260
Now,

867
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,260
the Xia family is in the hands of the Emperor.

868
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,260
It's a good time to take care of it.

869
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,260
Now, the imperial concubine of the Empress Dowager Xia

870
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,260
will be in the palace.

871
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,260
It's the time when His Majesty missed his mother

872
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,260
and became a filial son.

873
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,260
His Majesty has been a mother since childhood

874
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,260
and he has been disliked by the Empress Dowager.

875
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,260
You know this.

876
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,260
He took Liu Yuanfeng's report

877
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,260
and put His Majesty's pain

878
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,260
in my bones.

879
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,260
Li's surname is Jiang.

880
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,260
Now, the Zhen Nv Hall has this matter.

881
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,260
Even if His Majesty and the Six Palace don't mention it,

882
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,260
we should bring Li back.

883
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,260
Don't you blame him?

884
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,260
What's there to blame?

885
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,260
It's been so many years.

886
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,260
I believe he has already repented.

887
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,260
Besides,

888
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,260
what's in this world

889
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,260
can compare to the innocence and reputation of the Jiang family?

890
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,260
Please make the decision.

891
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,260
The trouble is

892
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:24,260
Li is still in the hands of Duke Su.

893
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,260
Duke Su?

894
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,260
Why is he in his hands?

895
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,260
I don't know how this person

896
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,260
put a criminal in Jiangli

897
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,260
and hid the money.

898
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,260
Once this crime is proven,

899
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,260
Li Zhongnan won't be needed to make the mistake.

900
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,260
The Jiang family will never be able to wash their hands again.

901
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,260
I have to see Duke Su.

902
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,260
If we can bring him back,

903
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,260
we can't just let it go.

904
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,260
It will make the Jiang family feel guilty.

905
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,260
I understand what you mean.

906
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,260
If Duke Su is willing to let Li go,

907
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,260
and bring Li back,

908
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,260
I will take care of the whole thing.

909
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,260
The Jiang family is a prosperous family.

910
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,260
We can bring Li back.

911
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,260
Who else would dare to

912
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,260
teach the Jiang family a lesson?

913
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,260
Madam.

914
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,260
You have such a big heart.

915
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,260
Such a big body.

916
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,260
I am really touched.

917
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:29,260
For so many years,

918
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:33,260
you have been the one who has suffered the most.

919
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,260
When Li did that to you,

920
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,260
It's all in the past.

921
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,260
If you don't mention it,

922
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,260
I...

923
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,260
I...

924
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,260
I almost forget about my child.

925
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,260
Madam.

926
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,260
I promise you.

927
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:06,260
If Li is still as unrepentant as he was before,

928
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,260
and still has a grudge against you,

929
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,260
I will not let him go.

930
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,260
Thank you, husband.

931
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,260
Husband.

932
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,260
After using me,

933
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,260
aren't you going to give me an answer?

934
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,260
Duke Su.

935
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,260
What do you want to ask?

936
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,260
What is your surname?

937
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,260
You should already know.

938
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,260
I ask, you answer.

939
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,260
My surname is Jiang.

940
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,260
My surname is Li.

941
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,260
I am the daughter of the Grand Preceptor.

942
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,260
Why did you collude with the criminal?

943
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,260
I lied to you.

944
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,260
Lied to me?

945
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,260
That means you didn't collude with the criminal.

946
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,260
It's the private lover.

947
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,260
Duke Su is good at talking.

948
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,260
I don't know him at all.

949
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,260
I just wanted to see Madam Liu in the ancestral hall.

950
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,260
I didn't provoke any of you.

951
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,260
I didn't force you to marry me.

952
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,260
This is not the answer I want.

953
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,260
I only have this answer.

954
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,260
You can't ask me the answer I want.

955
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,260
No one can get out of this room.

956
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,260
Maybe I am an exception.

957
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,260
Zhu Xun, Mr. Jiang is here.

958
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,260
He is already in the main hall.

959
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,260
You came so fast.

960
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,260
He asked me to bring you a message.

961
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,260
What?

962
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,260
He said if you dare to go to the court,

963
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:38,260
he would bring the seal and go to the Emperor.

964
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,260
Okay.

965
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,260
It seems that he can't live here.

966
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,260
Did he trick us on the way?

967
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,260
He asked us to catch him on purpose.

968
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,260
But he can't be interrogated.

969
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,260
He is like a god.

970
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,260
It's not bad to see it as a play.

971
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,260
How should we deal with him?

972
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,260
The former takes good care of him.

973
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,260
He has no harm.

974
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,260
He will be here when the Jiang family comes.

975
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,260
But there is no woman in our house.

976
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,260
Go and bring his maid back.

977
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,260
Mr. Jiang,

978
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,260
the lady in the house made a request.

979
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,260
Say it.

980
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,260
She said she wanted you to arrange for her

981
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,260
to meet some people in the main hall.

982
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,260
Why does she think I will help her?

983
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,260
She said if you don't help her,

984
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,260
she will never let you

985
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,260
return her to the Jiang family.

986
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,260
Where is the Duke?

987
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,260
He just finished his question.

988
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,260
He is resting.

989
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,260
Where is my daughter?

990
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,260
I want to see her now.

991
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,260
Don't worry, Mr. Jiang.

992
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,260
You have already asked about the second lady.

993
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,260
It's a misunderstanding.

994
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,260
The second lady is fair and innocent.

995
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,260
She just got a little scared.

996
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:02,260
The lord asked me to say something to the Jiang family.

997
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,260
The second lady can be brought back by the Jiang family.

998
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,260
Duke Su, you have nothing else to say?

999
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,260
Yes, I have two more words.

1000
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,260
One is that the second lady

1001
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,260
is indebted to the emperor.

1002
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,260
The other is that when the second lady

1003
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,260
came to the house to pick up people,

1004
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,260
she sent the second lady to the Duke's house

1005
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,260
to take care of the second lady.

1006
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,260
What are you doing here?

1007
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,260
I'm here to help you.

1008
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,260
I am lucky to have you.

1009
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,260
I can go back to the Jiang family now.

1010
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:47,260
I will be back soon.

1011
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,260
I will be back soon.

1012
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,260
I will be back soon.

1013
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,260
So I will make sure you don't die.

1014
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,260
Just die?

1015
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,260
Of course.

1016
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,260
But

1017
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,260
you have to

1018
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,260
swallow the Jiang family's matter completely.

1019
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,260
I am doing this for your own good.

1020
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,260
This case will be investigated immediately.

1021
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,260
You committed a crime of theft of the Qin family.

1022
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,260
You are a victim of the Ming family.

1023
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,260
You are injured by the phoenix painting.

1024
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,260
It has nothing to do with them.

1025
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,260
You don't have to die.

1026
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,260
I am begging you.

1027
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,260
I can release the painting in advance.

1028
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,260
But you

1029
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,260
killed the Prime Minister's daughter.

1030
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,260
It is a death penalty.

1031
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,260
I am at most

1032
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,260
a greedy and rich person.

1033
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,260
I can't risk my life.

1034
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,260
But you

1035
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,260
are still alive.

1036
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,260
None of you can escape.

1037
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,260
Don't think that

1038
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,260
you can take me by force.

1039
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,260
I can't die.

1040
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,260
But I can watch you die.

1041
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,260
Is he okay?

1042
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,260
He still has feelings towards you, right?

1043
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,880
He is no longer everybody's

1044
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,880
subordinate.

1045
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,460
Because this is a happy ending.

1046
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,460
This is one of them.

1047
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,460
Defeat the Empress!

1048
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,460
No way.

1049
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,020
P advertisement to the King of Phoenix Journey bi窒

1050
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,960
Bailey someone Aleper

1051
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,960
Slowly leave.

1052
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,960
If there is no happy memory

1053
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:31,960
How can I cross the sad bottom

1054
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,960
Two cold and heartless people

1055
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,960
Holding hands

1056
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,960
Can we get through the cold

1057
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,960
Can we get through the snow

1058
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,960
In the cold wind

1059
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,960
In the long night

1060
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:05,960
Hugging the remaining warmth

1061
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,960
Stepping on the ground

1062
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,960
Uncertain

1063
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,960
Can we bury the regret of yesterday

1064
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,960
Love to cherish with life

1065
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:35,960
Live on even if it's a little hurt

1066
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,960
No matter sorrow or joy

1067
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,960
I believe you

1068
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,960
I'd rather be trapped in the world

1069
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,960
Live on, gather all the courage

1070
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,960
Love on, love on until you breathe

1071
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,960
The loneliness of crossing the half life

1072
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,960
Only for you

1073
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,140
After the

1074
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,960
It's not far away

1075
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,960
After the

1076
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:30,960
It's not far away
