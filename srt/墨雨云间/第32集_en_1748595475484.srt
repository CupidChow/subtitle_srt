1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hold a lake in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't know

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When the spring color is still the same

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 1

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's good to be honest with your past life

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Never do it for others

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And do it for someone else

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That other person also includes me

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Put down your hair

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
These viewers are very screenshoting

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,400
Please accept these

21
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Good.

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,080
Good.

23
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,640
Dollong...

24
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,160
Girl N俭月...

25
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
Now are you confused withếuS?

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,960
I just gave them Leiao Fang message.

27
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,240
and after some more time,

28
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,120
you'll depend on S chops.

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,840
Thank you.

30
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,680
No need.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,080
Xiao Heng has already returned this love to you.

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
If I can help you in the future,

33
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,240
I will do my best.

34
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,040
If you really want to help me,

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,880
then take a deep breath and look ahead.

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Where's your bell?

37
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,640
It's in Wenji's place.

38
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,400
That's what I gave you.

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
You should take care of it.

40
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,960
What did I keep in my wife's house?

41
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm so blind.

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,720
Why did I give you the thing?

43
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,040
Jiun Yu.

44
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,480
The truth is light to you.

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,400
Yang Freshman'syasca

46
00:03:41,560 --> 00:04:06,360
Did you

47
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,160
I'll go to the Great Yan Emperor to talk to Lian Ying.

48
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,360
Brother.

49
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,240
There are some things that I can't ask for.

50
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,640
If he really likes me,

51
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,960
how could he wait for you to say it?

52
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,580
Please come through this way.

53
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,320
You, please come there.

54
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,800
If you really don't like me,

55
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,560
there would be an enormous risk that you take me there.

56
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Brother.

57
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,660
Don't be!

58
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,180
You just wanted to change.

59
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,960
I wouldn't have to take you there.

60
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,260
You two try yourself!

61
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,080
What's wrong with you?

62
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,380
And then Home Director even let his son return.

63
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,960
His start was very liberal.

64
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,300
I don't agree.

65
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,800
Princess' banes will be soon to be品.

66
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,380
My mother has an GitHub.

67
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,480
Don't let Jiang Li come.

68
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,320
You can't mi sorry.

69
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
Okay.

70
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,420
I won't let her come.

71
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,320
I'll see if you feel hot.

72
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,800
And go get some water.

73
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,200
All right, if ø, Adviser Means You Will Come

74
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,520
Alright, let's beanc Channel

75
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,600
Thank you

76
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Brother, where is Mother?

77
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Why can't I find her?

78
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Mother has been busy all day.

79
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
She has a cold.

80
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,360
I just gave her some medicine to sleep.

81
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
I'll go and see her.

82
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
Don't disturb her.

83
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
She has already slept.

84
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Go change your clothes.

85
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Come with me to the camp.

86
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
I'll go to the study first.

87
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,560
Brother, I thinkanga is here.

88
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,120
Good morning, Mr. Wu.

89
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,760
Your Highness.

90
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Get prepared.

91
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
I thinkanga is at the bridge,

92
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360

93
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,020

00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,020
Pickкий

95
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,160
Where do you want?

96
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,480
No

97
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,200
Why do you appear so close to no one?

98
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,980
If I'm all right, what do you want to know?

99
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,020
I am just a new woman

100
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:06,640
All the devil's laws that the irritated chitis

101
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,020
Here, come.

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,060
Many thanks to the Weon Club.

Here.

104
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:25,200
These are the gifts from the washi根

105
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,680
Until now you already know.

106
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,020
Since the time you're alive,

107
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,380
I acted as if I was in your heart.

108
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,980
Shen Xun is now a popular person in front of His Majesty.

109
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,780
I hope Shen Xun will take more care of you.

110
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,980
Shen Xun, I toast to you.

111
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,980
Come.

112
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,980
Let's toast to you.

Come.

118
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,780
You said it well.

119
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,580
You said it well.

120
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,780
I said it well.

121
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,980
Come.

122
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,780
You drink.

Come.

Go.

126
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,980
Go.

127
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,980
You're welcome.

128
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,780
You're welcome.

129
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,780
You're welcome.

130
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,180
You're welcome.

131
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,380
You're welcome.

132
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:27,780
Come.

133
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
Let me introduce you to my wife.

134
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,780
She's a good woman.

135
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,980
You're welcome.

136
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,980
You're welcome.

137
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,980
You're welcome.

138
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,180
So, A'Li, from now on,

139
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,980
you don't have to go to any person.

140
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
Let me go.

141
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,980
Let me go.

142
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Let me go.

143
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,980
Let me go.

144
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,980
Let me go.

145
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,980
Let me go.

146
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,980
Let me go.

147
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,980
Let me go.

148
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,980
Shen Xun.

149
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,780
When will you come with me?

150
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,980
This is the first time

151
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,080
I have come to ShenZhai

152
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,380
for the first time.

153
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,180
If you want

154
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,680
to go in,

155
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,280
I can leave it to you.

156
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,880
Only a place

157
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,080
that will make you want toacho.

158
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,480
Do you think

159
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,280
that I will go in

160
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,280
this place?

161
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,780
I'm not pretending.

162
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,780
I tried to convince myself to believe you were Jiang Li.

163
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,780
You can continue acting and pretending.

164
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,780
I will also continue to believe you.

165
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,780
Now, you don't need this.

166
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,780
If you confess, aren't you afraid that I will attack you?

167
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,780
You knew my identity long ago.

168
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,780
So, as long as you think about it, you can always remove your clothes.

169
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,780
But you didn't. Why?

170
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,180
You planned to steal my love.

171
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,380
It was your mother who arranged it.

172
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:23,380
You killed me because your mother was dead.

173
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,180
I didn't do anything wrong.

174
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,380
You always liked to push all the mistakes towards others.

175
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,180
Li...

176
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,780
Shen Yurong, you are used to being that uneducated, uneducated person.

177
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,980
Everything was forced by others. You are not wrong. You are pitiful.

178
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,980
You believe it yourself.

179
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,780
So, that day, you blocked that knife for me.

180
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,180
You also said that love word to me.

181
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,180
I only felt disgusting after listening to it.

182
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,780
Since your love words can speak,

183
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,580
why can't you see it with your guilt?

184
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,580
You protected my identity in the hall.

185
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,580
You saved me with your life when I was in the knife house.

186
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,380
You haven't reached the end yet.

187
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,980
Li...

188
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,580
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,980
You and I...

190
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,780
Let's change the way.

191
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,780
What way?

192
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,780
The hall...

193
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,180
The face of the holy man.

194
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,380
You personally went to the holy man

195
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,980
to expose you and Wan Ning to the so-called evil sects of Xue family.

196
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,780
The so-called evil sects of Xue family are all out.

197
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,180
This is the only way you can be guilty.

198
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,980
I know that you have a good life.

199
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,980
This is the last chance I give you.

200
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,980
You are so greedy to meet me.

201
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,180
Just to let me go to the police.

202
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,980
This is what you should do.

203
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,780
Shen Yurong, you are a student of ten thousand books.

204
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,980
You are a little pervert. You are not late.

205
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,580
Li...

206
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,980
I already have a life of your life.

207
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,380
I already regretted my life.

208
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,980
If mother and sister die because of me,

209
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,180
then I will be in great pain.

210
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,180
I can give my life to you and let you be the host.

211
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,380
But I must keep the holy family.

212
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,980
So,

213
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,980
in your eyes,

214
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,980
your mother and sister's crime

215
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,580
does not need to belong to my innocence and wrongness.

216
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,980
It does not need to be returned to normal.

217
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Right?

218
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,980
I am sorry.

219
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,980
Okay.

220
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,980
Shen Yurong,

221
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,980
Shen Yurong,

222
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,980
you are not allowed to choose this path.

223
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,180
Just think that I have wronged you again.

224
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,380
Continue to keep your word.

225
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,980
You wait.

226
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,580
I will take your retribution

227
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,180
and personally get the day you and Wanning met.

228
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,980
You are not like Wanning.

229
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,580
She has a king in her hand.

230
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,780
I am not like you.

231
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,780
You are timid and coward.

232
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,180
I am reminding you.

233
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,780
No need.

234
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,380
No need.

235
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
Let go of me.

236
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,380
Shen Yurong.

237
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,380
Let go of me.

238
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,580
Let go of me.

239
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,380
Let go of me.

240
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,980
Are you okay?

241
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,380
I'm fine.

242
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,580
I saw you come out for too long.

243
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,580
I was worried that I would come out to find you.

244
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,180
I didn't expect that she would dare to treat you.

245
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,380
I am still in a hurry.

246
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,780
I should be fine.

247
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,580
I will go find the doctor first.

248
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,980
Cousin,

249
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,180
don't worry about this.

250
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,180
I will handle it.

251
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,980
Why?

252
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,180
I saw her treated you so badly just now.

253
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,380
She is going to be so rude to me.

254
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,180
So I hit her with my hand.

255
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,780
I hit her?

256
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,380
Behind Shen Yurong,

257
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,380
is Princess Wanning.

258
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,580
If you are in this situation because of Wanning's grudge,

259
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,780
you and Ye family will be in trouble.

260
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,380
Listen to me.

261
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,180
Wanning and I are just a couple.

262
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,380
We don't need to worry about this.

263
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,780
But how could I push this thing to you?

264
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,780
I am not going to hide it.

265
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,380
I was going to hit her with my hand.

266
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,380
You just did what I wanted to do.

267
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,180
Moreover,

268
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,980
you won't be able to help me in the future

269
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,180
until you are in this situation.

270
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,380
I can help you in the future.

271
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,180
This is my personal grudge.

272
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,980
I know.

273
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,980
You don't know?

274
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,580
Have you been framed?

275
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,980
Have you been framed?

276
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,580
Have you been locked up in the cellar?

277
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,380
Have you been buried alive?

278
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,380
Do you know

279
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,380
how many people have been killed for this?

280
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,380
Consort Xue,

281
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,180
I am a little help from the bottom of my heart.

282
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,580
Since you know everything,

283
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,580
listen to me.

284
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,380
Leave now.

285
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,380
Or else, you will be in trouble again.

286
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,580
I beg you, Yan Shi Jie.

287
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,880
You're hungry?

288
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Youriscorr.

289
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,180
What's wrong?

290
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,220
It's a joke.

291
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,780
Where are you?

292
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,380
Where are you?

293
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,980
Don't scare me.

294
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,780
What's going on?

295
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,580
I don't know.

296
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,180
Where are you?

297
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,780
What's wrong?

298
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,580
Where are you?

299
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,380
What's wrong?

300
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,180
Go and look over there.

301
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,780
Let's go.

302
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,380
Let's go.

303
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,980
Let's go.

304
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,380
Mother.

305
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,180
Mother.

306
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,980
Mother.

307
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,780
Mother.

308
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:31,980
Mother.

309
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,780
Shen Xuan wants to steal my house.

310
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,380
What?

311
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,580
Son.

312
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,980
Let go of my son.

313
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,380
You want to ruin my son.

314
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,780
Son, come back.

315
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,780
Son.

316
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,580
You want to ruin my son.

317
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,180
Let him go.

318
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,580
You.

319
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,380
Don't go.

320
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,180
I'll catch him.

321
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,380
He stole my son's blood.

322
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,980
Mother.

323
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,580
What are you doing?

324
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,580
It's Shen Yurong who is rude to Jiang Li.

325
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,180
He has been sent to the Dali Temple.

326
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,980
If you call the police again,

327
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,580
he will never come back.

328
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,780
Mother.

329
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,780
Mother.

330
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,980
Shen Yurong.

331
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,780
Mother.

332
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,380
Mother.

333
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,580
Mother.

334
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,380
Mother.

335
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,780
Mother, wake up.

336
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,980
Mother.

337
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,980
Mother, wake up.

338
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,580
Mother.

339
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,380
Mother, wake up.

340
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,980
What happened?

341
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
Mother.

342
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:55,980
What happened?

343
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,380
I don't want to tell the future比如

344
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,340
I won't talk about

345
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,680
the future

346
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,020
If you have any worries

347
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,300
It's also not a bad thing

348
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,100
I will tell you

349
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,140
Please

350
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,300
I can't

351
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,860
I want to talk about

352
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,300
If I go

353
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,740
I can't let you suffer so much.

354
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,940
Come, take a rest.

355
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,500
What are you going to do?

356
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,580
Li is the eldest daughter of our Jiang family.

357
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,260
I don't know how to

358
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,580
make a contribution for the child.

359
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,940
Just say Shen family.

360
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,060
He dared to bully our Jiang family.

361
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,420
This has been passed down to the police

362
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,180
and the police station.

363
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,740
You have to know for a lifetime.

364
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,140
Now, what does this name

365
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,100
look like to be harassed by the Shen family?

366
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,700
Can you really feel this anger?

367
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,780
Li's son was abandoned in Zhenyu Hall.

368
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,780
For so many years,

369
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,580
you haven't been responsible for your father.

370
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,220
Last year, after he was taken back,

371
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,820
he kept on doing things.

372
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,460
He has little physical education.

373
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,300
This time, you really have to think about it.

374
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,460
Mother taught me a lesson.

375
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,460
Before, I was too careless.

376
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,700
I hurt my parents' feelings and didn't know myself.

377
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,180
This time, I must take the responsibility of being a father

378
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,340
and make a contribution for my daughter.

379
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,580
Bai An!

380
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,020
I will personally write a complaint for Li!

381
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,260
Don't shout at me, girl!

382
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:06,380
penis,

383
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
All right, my way.

384
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,340
You took the blame for so many troubles.

385
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,180
I mistreated your kingdom after you wore this suit.

386
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,860
I walk in with the dust.

387
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,220
Zhenyu's military work has been completed in two more days.

388
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,500
I was busy with the chaos and chaos.

389
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,820
But I was confused.

390
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,100
What's the use of

391
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,100
making His Majesty react?

392
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,860
The Great Zhao State Army came to my camp

393
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,260
and separated my sister from home.

394
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,060
The result was so coincidental.

395
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,900
My sister met the assassin.

396
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,020
So ridiculous.

397
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,460
Did they catch him?

398
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,820
They did.

399
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,500
This is the worst.

400
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,940
They let the assassin get out of the capital.

401
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,900
Do you think I'm angry?

402
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,620
The emperor is angry.

403
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,220
He's not.

404
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,900
So I killed the assassin

405
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,340
who killed my sister.

406
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,460
The emperor?

407
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,580
Yes.

408
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,860
I'm also curious.

409
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,100
Why did the emperor

410
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,620
change the main position in our camp?

411
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,740
My sister asked me

412
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,420
if someone

413
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,180
wanted to fight with the Great Zhao State

414
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,620
without my camp.

415
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,180
The emperor made a military service in the north.

416
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,340
His Majesty fought with the Great Zhao State.

417
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,940
The north and the south are stable.

418
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,860
It's my father's.

419
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,620
Why did someone break it?

420
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,260
My sister is right.

421
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,180
Now there's someone who wants to be a dog.

422
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,060
That's a stupid thing.

423
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,260
Now the meeting is over.

424
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,620
It's a big deal.

425
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,060
Unfortunately,

426
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,060
my sister didn't get to see

427
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,380
the two generals' unborn children.

428
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,060
My sister said

429
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,460
the second wife of the emperor is Shen Yurong's wife.

430
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,060
I don't think

431
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,700
I can save my life.

432
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,860
His Majesty said

433
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,380
it's my fault.

434
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,060
It's a pity.

435
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,620
Now Shen Yurong

436
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,140
is thinking about the future of the Great Zhao State.

437
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,380
It's clear that

438
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,740
he's not good for the second wife of the emperor.

439
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,260
He's a good man.

440
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,940
He's a good man.

441
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,820
Is this the meeting

442
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,660
for the Shen's unborn children?

443
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,940
Yes.

444
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,820
I'm surprised.

445
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,500
It's late.

446
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,140
Go back and rest.

447
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

448
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,300
Yes.

449
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,820
this meeting is very important.

450
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

451
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,500
To the imperial court.

452
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,580
Yes.

453
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:46,980
Wait.

454
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,240
Psalm Recesses?

455
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Then don't you worry about that how many she'll be left with?

456
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:08,200
So, you're wondering whether Shen Yurong is guilty of any kind of harrisment?

457
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:14,260
Huantu and she are pregnant,

458
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,940
Aren't you afraid of dying?

459
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,800
Lift your head up.

460
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,140
You looked at me with your eyes high and low.

461
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,700
You knew I was a bad man.

462
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,780
You were so innocent.

463
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,580
But you still wanted to make me a fool.

464
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,580
I'm tired.

465
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,860
Aren't you tired?

466
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,060
I killed my wife

467
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,300
for my mother and sister.

468
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,340
For the sake of the whole world,

469
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,100
I have no credit for my suffering.

470
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,260
I deserve to die.

471
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,220
You're blaming me again?

472
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,820
I'm not blaming you.

473
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,820
I'm not blaming anyone.

474
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,540
I just hope you can live well

475
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,740
and let my mother and sister go.

476
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,020
As for me,

477
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,380
if you don't kill me,

478
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,300
you'll be waiting for the court to judge me.

479
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,260
It's good to keep you in custody.

480
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,020
It's good to be a part of it.

481
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,020
It's good to keep you in custody.

482
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,540
I admit it.

483
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,900
What nonsense are you talking about?

484
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,060
You're not pitying me?

485
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,660
Are you pitying me?

486
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,220
Are you the only one?

487
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,220
Your Highness, you don't have to save me.

488
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,780
You've been so nice to me.

489
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,700
It's your turn.

490
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,620
I don't tell everything,

491
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,820
so you can learn her first.

492
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,980
Crown Princess,

493
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,340
maybe nothing了吧.

494
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,580
It's a big deal.

495
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,240
That's right.

496
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,560
in my hands.

497
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,600
What are you doing?

498
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,120
Of course,

499
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,360
I'm saving you.

500
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,760
Why do you come so late?

501
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,360
You're back from Zhao Fei.

502
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,280
Why are you at home?

503
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,280
I'm here for you.

504
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,960
Please take care of her.

505
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,560
You came to me at that time.

506
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,400
I'm not afraid of being discovered.

507
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,800
Tea.

508
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,320
Where's the next one?

509
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,480
Do you remember I asked you before?

510
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,160
Which brick of the palace

511
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,360
is Shen Yurong and the princess standing?

512
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,040
I thought Shen Yurong could return to the city.

513
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,880
But I didn't expect he was still obsessed with the wealth.

514
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,600
Now,

515
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,640
I need to use Shen Yurong to find that brick

516
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,920
and find out the relationship between them

517
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,520
in front of the people.

518
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,320
Do you think

519
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,960
Wan Ning will save Shen Yurong?

520
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,640
If she doesn't save him,

521
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,080
she will lose.

522
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,560
As best as your princess.

523
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,040
What a great pair of match.

524
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,200
What's the matter?

525
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,480
When you take your reputation

526
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,980
intoắn his future and fight against it together

527
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,160
just win it.

528
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,040
Xiao Heng.

529
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,520
I was not thatpper as you thought.

530
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,720
Right.

531
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,080
Void luck.

532
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,920
Fate's equations and interests

533
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,080
always make meです 如果咱们每一句话算 prom了

534
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,120
each other.

535
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,840
I'm not as shallow as you think.

536
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,720
I want to go out with Shen Yunrong.

537
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,720
I want to be in my place of harm.

538
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,240
I want to see if his conscience is still alive.

539
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,240
How much did he dare to commit suicide?

540
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,240
I didn't expect that he would still reject me.

541
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,680
At that time,

542
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,120
I was going to beg for mercy and beg for mercy.

543
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,720
He was so entangled

544
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,240
that he would make Ye Shijie misunderstand

545
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,600
and beat him up.

546
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,440
Ye Xia is Jiang Li's family.

547
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,000
She is also my family.

548
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,720
I can't let them

549
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,280
suffer because of me.

550
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,560
So I must take the blame

551
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,720
for this beating.

552
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,720
So he really has no reason for you today.

553
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Otherwise, you're the one in jail today.

554
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,480
Yes.

555
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,720
You promised me that you wouldn't go out with Shen Yunrong twice.

556
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,080
This is your second time to tell me.

557
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,800
This time, it's not because of my intention.

558
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,680
It's just that the situation is not good.

559
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,720
Hongzhu,

560
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,620
this is a case of

561
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,960
an utilization of the pride of our family.

562
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,400
We have to make Sister Yang

563
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,000
our next success.

564
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,920
Lin Yu 的读斯,

565
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,240
Let's just go back to the opera house.

566
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,080
We're waiting for an opportunity

567
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,440
to be together again.

568
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,520
Youngest Reign is back.

569
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,240
Won't oy him here again with Lin Yu?

570
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,240
Now, I am willing to go to you.

571
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
I am not Fu Lei Yi.

572
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,240
I want to help you.

573
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
I want to help you.

574
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Lady, Wen Ji Fei asked me to tell you

575
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,240
that the main emperor knows about you

576
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,240
so he sent a group of people to come back from the border to the border.

577
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
I know.

578
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,240
His clothes are still in the underwear that was worn at the beginning.

579
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
Princess, I hope you can let me know.

580
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Shen Yurong is now a master of the world.

581
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
If Princess is saved now,

582
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,240
she might have her hands dirty.

583
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Why don't you wipe your face off

584
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
and pretend to be the one who killed you?

585
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,240
It's like that when the wind blows and the grass moves.

586
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,240
You are still so calm.

587
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Tell him to train his soldiers.

588
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,240
I will of course move in the court.

589
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Yes.

590
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,240
Consort Xue, it's time for me to come back to you.

591
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,240
How are you going to deal with Shen Yurong?

592
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
I want to see what the Jiang family is going to do.

593
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,240
The Jiang family won't let him go?

594
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
That's not the right reason.

595
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
I want to see what Wan Ning will do.

596
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,240
This Jiang Erniang is a very good person.

597
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,240
It's a pity that he is not a god of the south.

598
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Otherwise, he can do anything for the court.

599
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
I have thought about it.

600
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
If we move further, it will be dangerous.

601
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
You used to take advantage of him to get into Shen Yurong.

602
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Now you want Princess to come and fight with you.

603
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
Have you thought about it?

604
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,240
He might not be able to bear the rebellion of Princess.

605
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Isn't he just a pawn?

606
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
Why are you so nervous?

607
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
He is not a pawn.

608
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
Xiao Heng.

609
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
You are in love.

610
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Yes.

611
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,240
I warned you not to be too angry.

612
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
Have you forgotten what kind of road we are going to take?

613
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,240
If I say that I have to sacrifice him to complete our red-painted big night.

614
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
Do you still remember

615
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,240
when you first went to the court?

616
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,240
Why hasn't His Majesty come yet?

617
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,240
He hasn't come for the first time.

618
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
He can still wait for the next time.

619
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
I am sorry.

620
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
Your Majesty.

621
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
Your Majesty.

622
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
Your Majesty.

623
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
Your Majesty.

624
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
Your Majesty.

625
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,240
Where are you, Your Majesty?

626
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,240
Your Majesty.

627
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,240
They are all looking for you.

628
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,240
If I leave,

629
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
they won't be able to live.

630
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
You went to the court the day before.

631
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,240
If you are not here,

632
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
they will be the sixth-gen.

633
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
Come.

634
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,240
I will put you in the tree.

635
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
I know.

636
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,240
They are not really trusting me.

637
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,240
I am not capable of facing those two-and-meals.

638
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,240
Why don't you let the one who can do it do it?

639
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
If I don't try,

640
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
how can I know that I can't?

641
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
Tell me.

642
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
Did Father see my beauty?

643
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
Maybe what His Majesty saw

644
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
is your heart.

645
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
You care about the people.

646
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
If you can remember this kindness

647
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
and be a good emperor,

648
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
I believe that God will be a good emperor.

649
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
And I

650
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
will always be with you.

651
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,240
At that time,

652
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
I don't want to recall.

653
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,240
I know that you are under great pressure.

654
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
You are a man of the world.

655
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
You are a man of the world.

656
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,240
You shouldn't be so anxious.

657
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
You shouldn't forget your original intention.

658
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
No matter what,

659
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
I will always be by your side.

660
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,240
As long as you are a good emperor,

661
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,240
I will sacrifice my life

662
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
for the rest of my family.

663
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
You are your wife.

664
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,240
You are a good emperor.

665
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
You should protect yourself.

666
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,240
The next two days are

667
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
the day when the Great Li Temple interrogates Shen Yurong.

668
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
Are you really not going to let me admit

669
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
that I got her married?

670
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
If the oral palace changes,

671
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,240
it will cause people to doubt.

672
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
The point of this matter

673
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,240
is not who got Shen Yurong.

674
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
It's Shen Yurong who is against me.

675
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,240
But I think

676
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
I am too impulsive.

677
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
You are doing this for my own good.

678
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
You are helping me.

679
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,240
I wanted to give you a message.

680
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,240
I asked the Great Li Temple

681
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
yesterday.

682
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
He said that this matter is a serious matter.

683
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Even if Shen Yurong has the ability to be great,

684
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
he can't let everyone shut up.

685
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,240
Since he doesn't want to be a good official,

686
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,240
he should be a good person.

687
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,240
Don't you think it's scary?

688
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
I am not Jiang Li.

689
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,240
I am not your cousin.

690
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
I am a woman who has lost her reputation.

691
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,240
I am the king of Shen Yurong.

692
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,240
I have lived for Jiang Li's identity.

693
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Now I am back to Jiang's heart.

694
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I don't think it's scary.

695
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
I don't care who you are,

696
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
but you helped me

697
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
and the Ye family.

698
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Our friendship

699
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,240
is not fake.

700
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,240
And

701
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
when I know your experience,

702
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
I realize

703
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
that I have known you for so long.

704
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
So,

705
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
do whatever you want to do.

706
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Just do it.

707
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,240
You don't ask what I want to do?

708
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
I just want to tell you

709
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
no matter how far you go,

710
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
I will always be by your side.

711
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
My lady,

712
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
the head of the princess's mansion sent someone to send you a letter.

713
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,240
How dare you.

714
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
This...

715
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,240
this letter

716
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
is intended

717
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,240
to stop the Marquis of Xi Huaiyuan's case.

718
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,240
The head of the princess

719
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,240
will always be against Lin'er.

720
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Why would she

721
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,240
invite him to her mansion

722
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,240
for this marriage?

723
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
What did Lin'er react to?

724
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,240
She said she needs to go,

725
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,880
he always had a way to make her go back on her word.

726
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,720
He also said that if Princess Zhang really wants to do something to her,

727
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,520
he doesn't have to be so bold to make a promise to her in front of us.

728
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,320
Since he has decided, I will accompany him tomorrow.

729
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,440
I don't believe that he would dare to act as if he had forgotten

730
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,040
and be a victim of Li'er in front of me.

731
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,060
Second Sister is here.

732
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:22,240
You need to get on the horse for a journey to village

733
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,440
where you are long living,

734
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,940
you have to bury a place in there

735
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,640
so you will have a way ofkind soul

736
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,640
with her.

737
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,640
Madam Jia, please.

738
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,160
Madam Jia,

739
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
you're the only one who can go there.

740
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,160
You said you'd let someone come.

741
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,480
And you didn't say you'd let only one person come.

742
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,880
Please don't make things difficult for me.

743
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,000
Father Wu Ai,

744
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,200
it's good that you're waiting for me outside.

745
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,920
How can I do if you're here?

746
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,180
igo

747
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,100
I wanted to keyboardize with Madam Jiang for the long run.

748
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,120
It's a shame that I'm kept away from her.

749
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,740
We might as well

750
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,380
treat Madam Jiang

751
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,840
to give me a tip.

752
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,560
Your Highness, please come here

753
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,600
and let my father live outside.

754
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,120
It's not for me to make a mistake, is it?

755
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,360
Life is hard to keep secret.

756
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,440
I also want to see

757
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,440
if I can have the same

758
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,240
high mountains and rivers

759
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,040
as my parents.

760
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,480
Your Highness, thank you.

761
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,760
I can't bear to live in this life.

762
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,640
I can only hear the sound of your love.

763
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,200
Cold blood,

764
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,560
heartless,

765
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,560
and endless hatred.

766
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,720
I don't think so.

767
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,720
Isn't this the essence of

768
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,880
the flower petals falling into the flower petals?

769
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,840
You're the same.

770
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,160
You can only be a person

771
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,880
with hatred in your heart.

772
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,800
I wonder what your hatred is.

773
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,880
As the eldest princess of the Yan State,

774
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,280
you've been raised by thousands of people.

775
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,800
Now you're a noble and a noble lady.

776
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,800
You're a noble and a noble lady.

777
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,600
Your Highness, you're a person with hatred.

778
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,480
You don't need to be a noble lady.

779
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,160
The only thing that matters is

780
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,520
the people's care.

781
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,120
What do you know?

782
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,760
I should go to the state of Daiguo

783
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,000
to take care of the Yan State

784
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,200
and live in the cold and cold place

785
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,280
and live in the cold and cold place?

786
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,040
Then?

787
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,880
You want to make others

788
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,840
suffer in the cold and cold place?

789
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,480
I've never been so desperate

790
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,480
to live with hatred.

791
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,840
But I didn't hurt innocent people.

792
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,720
I didn't cause my own selfishness

793
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,960
to kill people.

794
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,400
You know a lot,

795
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,520
my dear.

796
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,080
You're a rabbit.

797
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,160
You know so much

798
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,800
and you even jumped into my cave.

799
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,280
Should I

800
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,520
kill you in person

801
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,160
and destroy you?

802
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,800
You can't kill me?

803
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,440
You're so confident.

804
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,960
You killed me.

805
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,400
How can you save Shen Yurong?

806
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,280
Do you know why I want to save him?

807
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
Because he's rich and rich,

808
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,560
Shen Yurong is more than you.

809
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,560
If he knows you're not good at him,

810
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,640
he'll definitely drag you into the water.

811
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,240
I'm not afraid of him dragging me into the water.

812
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,200
The whole court

813
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,640
owes me.

814
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,440
I can't pay back.

815
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,200
The person sitting on the chair

816
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,920
can't kill me no matter what.

817
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,320
You're so arrogant.

818
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,840
That's what I'm talking about.

819
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,960
Shen Yurong is like that.

820
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,720
He's so innocent to me.

821
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,840
I like him.

822
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,560
Princess Zhan, please wait.

823
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,400
Where's His Majesty?

824
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,680
His Majesty has summoned

825
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,840
a few imperial guards.

826
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,920
I'm afraid it's not convenient.

827
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,200
Okay.

828
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,080
Obviously he won'tangel his body.

829
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:57,760
Fine.

830
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,760
Let's go.

831
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,220
Who is it?

832
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,340
Zhang Jiuling.

833
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,940
No matter how tasty it is,

834
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,040
There is happiness and joy in this world.

835
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,820
Can we try and pray?

836
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,280
You are soLAl efficient and good.

837
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,580
Check out your social сп Dell.

838
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,860
Others are not concerned with me

839
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,660
specially welcome me

840
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,420
in the future.

841
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,500
Princess, please accept the blanket.

842
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,820
You picked up my handkerchief,

843
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,660
did you bereit my case

844
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,140
to form aando

845
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,940
as any jinx than you and I already have an destiny?

846
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,940
I have expect charts

847
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,660
I don't dare to speak with you

848
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,380
I was clever,

849
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,180
and I was able to pass through the scenery.

850
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,380
At that time, she only wanted to be a good official.

851
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,380
She had a heart of a son.

852
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,780
I had a natural illness.

853
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,980
She was too clean.

854
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,980
She was clean enough to make me think of

855
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,980
standing by her side

856
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,380
as a clean woman.

857
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,180
I was thinking,

858
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,380
if I didn't have a bodyguard,

859
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,380
maybe I would be like you,

860
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,980
and marry a good official

861
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,980
and live a normal life.

862
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,380
I don't think there's any difference between you and me.

863
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,980
If I can't even be happy like this,

864
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,380
what can you have?

865
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,180
Ming Yun and I are not good at each other.

866
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,780
I will hold Shen Yu Rong and scare her.

867
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,380
Then, we can be together.

868
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,380
Is there any point?

869
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,180
You killed Shen Yu Rong

870
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,180
and you were scared of her like the young man

871
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,580
who was scared of you.

872
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,380
As long as she is with me,

873
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,180
I don't care about her anymore.

874
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,380
You and her did so much harm to the world.

875
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,780
Now, you are the most worthy one.

876
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,380
Wan Ning,

877
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,380
you can't save her.

878
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,580
You can't live the life you want.

879
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,780
I can't save her.

880
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,580
You want to buy all the people who are involved in the attack.

881
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,980
I don't believe that you can let Wan Ning

882
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,380
do this to you.

883
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,180
I really don't have that much energy.

884
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,780
Even if Shen Yu Rong doesn't need so many people,

885
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,780
just one person is enough.

886
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,580
As long as you go to the Dali Temple,

887
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,980
and say that this is a misunderstanding,

888
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,180
it's your fault,

889
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,980
won't you be satisfied?

890
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,180
Okay.

891
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,380
I will say it as soon as possible.

892
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,380
As you wish.

893
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,780
Goodbye.

894
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,980
My father is still waiting for me at the door.

895
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,180
Don't worry.

896
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,980
He is here.

897
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,180
I will take you to see someone.

898
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,180
An old master.

899
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,180
I am here.

900
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:50,780
I am here.

901
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,180
I am here.

902
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,580
I am here.

903
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,980
I am here.

904
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,180
I am here.

905
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,380
I am here.

906
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,580
I am here.

907
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,780
I am here.

908
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,980
I am here.

909
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,180
I am here.

910
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,180
I am here.

911
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,180
I am here.

912
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,180
I am here.

913
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,180
I am here.

914
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,180
I am here.

915
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,180
I am here.

916
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,180
I am here.

917
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,180
I am here.

918
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,180
I am here.

919
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,180
I am here.

920
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,180
I am here.

921
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,180
I am here.

922
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,180
I am here.

923
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,180
I am here.

924
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,180
I am here.

925
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,180
I am here.

926
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,180
I am here.

927
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,180
I am here.
