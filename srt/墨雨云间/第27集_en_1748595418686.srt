1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm lonely in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly feel the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've walked through the cold winter and I still feel lonely

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When the spring color is still the same

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yu'er, let's go

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We've already told the Zhou family

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm fine, I'll take you back

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yu'er, come with us

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I won't go

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If I leave, it's nothing

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
As long as I take good care of her, she will get better

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Then we'll have a baby again

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm Mrs. Zhou

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll stay here, I'll be Mrs. Zhou

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yu'er

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's go

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Zhou Lang, Zhou Lang

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You used to hit me like that

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But now I'm not going anywhere

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll be your Mrs. Zhou

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Take good care of you

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let you live happily

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll be your Mrs. Zhou

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You've brought so many gifts

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're so kind

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Our family is looking forward to Ruo Yao

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She will be here soon

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Is Yao'er still unmarried?

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is it because of the love?

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No, she's not

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yao'er, hello to Uncle Qi

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Greetings to Mrs. Qi

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Mrs. Jiang

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I heard that you came to Jiangzhai to make trouble yesterday

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Ruo Yao may not be well

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm worried about you

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm a little bit upset

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This old woman can't be worried

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
She'll be at ease when she's married

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Our marriage will be over soon

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What Mrs. Qin said is...

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've found someone to settle it

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It'll be a auspicious day in three days

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's set the date that day

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It doesn't have to be so late

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
As the family said

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The list of guests will be left to Mrs. Jiang

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let me see what's missing

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Look, the list is already yours

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Our family will be married

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We'll have to make the wedding as grand as possible

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So that everyone in the capital can see it

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ruo Yao, right?

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't be so impulsive

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yao'er

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Please send the iron to Mrs. Qi

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes, there are many things going on

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Jiang Ruo Yao, think about it

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What is the real you?

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We should go back to work

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We'll go first

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Wait, Mrs. Qi

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't agree to this marriage

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If you don't want to settle this marriage

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You should have told me earlier

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why did the Qi family come to the wedding?

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You should have been ashamed

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Your mother did all these things for you

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's so hard for her

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's hard for her

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I can't bear to see it?

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If my mother could listen to me

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's not fair

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Ting Ting, it's my fault

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Since you and Zhou Yan Bang got married

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I've searched for many people

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's why I found this marriage

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't think Mr. Qi is worse than Zhou Yan Bang

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Why are you so dissatisfied with her?

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm not dissatisfied

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why?

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm dissatisfied

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's my mother

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What did you say?

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mother

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I know you've done a lot for me

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Ever since I was a child

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Have you thought about whether I want to do these things?

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
When I was eight

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
My father took me to the amusement park

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You said that women shouldn't go too far

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
When I was ten

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You forced me to love

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You didn't let me go to Liu Xie Jie's house

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
When I was twelve

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I was sick

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You forced me to take medicine

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You let me be the one who doesn't drink

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You even changed me to be the one who has a fixed marriage

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You didn't ask me if I wanted to take medicine

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Then you didn't live to die

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You forced me to choose

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't want to marry you

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But I've paid enough price for this

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So from now on

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I want to do things according to my own will

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Please don't interfere with my marriage

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you know what you're talking about?

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You wanted to marry Zhou Yan Bao at the time

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Now you blame me for everything

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you crazy?

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm not crazy

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I've been obsessed with Zhou Yan Bao

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Even if I find out that he is not a kind and kind person

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I still love him

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But now

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I understand

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm not really obsessed with Bu Hu

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But I want to have a chance to escape from Jiang family

131
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I want to avoid you

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Even if I use my marriage

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Mother, I don't understand anything in the past

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Now I understand everything

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's why I became like this

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You forced me

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Father, look at him

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Enough

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's not a big deal

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I was like him when I was young

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I also proposed to my parents

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
for our engagement

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I chose it myself

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But it turned out to be fine

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I thought that the three girls have the worst idea

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I could only listen to you

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I didn't expect this to be a good idea

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Listen to me

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Just listen to him

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let him choose

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But Qi Jia

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Qi Jia is a man

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What's wrong?

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You still have to make up for us

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Madam

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Madam

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If you want to worry about yourself

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Then you should worry about yourself

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If you get a quiet life

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Then you can sleep

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Come, sit down

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Sit down

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Sit down

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's Jiang Li, right?

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Did he teach you this?

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No one taught me

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Those

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's just that I've been wanting to say it for so many years

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But I didn't dare to say it

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
In these years

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
In this family

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Only mother is willing to do good for you

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You were called by Jiang Li

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Do you know?

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Those words he said

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Are all to confuse you

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He is doing this for his own benefit

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He wants to harm you

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Jiang Li didn't want to harm me

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He never mentioned me

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
From the beginning to the end

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like Zhou Yanbang and Si Ben

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But you

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You have been trying to seduce him to take me in

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What do you know?

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
If he dared to bite you

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Then he would be dead

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He would be in your hands

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He won't be able to escape

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What about me?

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What about my reputation?

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What about my feelings?

195
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You just want to destroy Jiang Li

196
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Have you ever considered me?

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You always say that others want to harm me

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Actually

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I just don't want to let others believe me

200
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I've done this for you

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
My wife

202
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Do you know how much I've paid for you?

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You mean

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
For me

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Did you eliminate Jiang Li and Jiang Yue?

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What do you mean?

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't mean anything

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I just want to tell you

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't need you to do this for me

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I, Jiang Ruoyao

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Not only can I step on others' bones

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
To go up

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
In addition

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If you want to go up

215
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You must step on others' bones

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Then I'd rather not go up

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Later

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll go and explain to my father

219
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I want to go out for a swim

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't want to get married

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You are so ungrateful, wife

222
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Your mother will apologize to you soon

223
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
She will forgive you

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't

225
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
From now on

226
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't let anyone else in

227
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This

228
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Are you still worried about Ruoyao?

229
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Qi's marriage is not a good thing

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's not a good family

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
At the beginning

232
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I and His Majesty

233
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll find a good marriage for Ruoyao

234
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Not a marriage

235
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's Ruoyao

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
She has been bewitched by Jiang Li

237
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
She has completely changed

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I can't control her

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Jiang Li

240
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
How dare you to harm Ruoyao

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If you continue like this

242
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm afraid it's hard for her

243
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This time

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I must kill her

245
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
At the beginning

246
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I remember you personally

247
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Take her out of the prison in Dalisi

248
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I thought

249
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
She would have a few feelings for you

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But now it seems

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm wrong

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't regret saving her

253
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
After all

254
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't want Jiang Yuan to be in trouble

255
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You have a way to avoid it

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
How can you pull together with the princess?

257
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Why did she look for you?

258
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Don't be used by her

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The enemy's enemy is a friend

260
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
She likes Jiang Li more than me

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It seems that you have decided

262
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't worry, sister

263
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I will kill Chu Gen this time

264
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Kill Chu Gen

265
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Madam

266
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I have a letter from my family

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The lady from the sea

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You have news

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Sit down first

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ok

271
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The sea sugar you want

272
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Is from the village rice shop

273
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Before, she was a maid

274
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
under the official title

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
She left for many years

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
She came to a lady in the village

277
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
She was just a scar on her face

278
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Her skin was turned out

279
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It was very scary

280
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't know if she wanted to find her

281
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I hope you can do something

282
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Other people can do it

283
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Don't worry, madam

284
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I have already followed

285
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
the lady's instructions

286
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
to watch over her

287
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I didn't see her

288
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I will go to change the hot tea

289
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The lady

290
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Sea sugar

291
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Why are you here?

292
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I want to take you out

293
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why did they kill you?

294
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The Shen family is a hell

295
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I want to take you out

296
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Don't worry

297
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I am not afraid

298
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I am not afraid

299
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I am afraid

300
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't worry

301
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You can help me

302
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
to pass the message to Xuezhao

303
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
to save me

304
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Madam

305
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Go

306
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't be hard on them

307
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
When the wolf comes

308
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't worry

309
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Go

310
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's just that her scar

311
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
has a long scar

312
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't know what it has

313
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
When you need something

314
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
to blow this scar

315
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
My men will come to protect you for me

316
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It seems useless

317
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's very dangerous

318
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What does máließen afraid?

319
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,600
Since your master has told me about your existence,

320
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,400
he will surely find out that I will ask you this question.

321
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,800
Just tell me.

322
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,400
I promise he won't punish you for this.

323
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
He came here seven years ago.

324
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,400
Seven years?

325
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
It seems that I can't even get his eyes

326
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
out of this yard.

327
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
Madam, is there a master?

328
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,200
I want you to go and check on him for me.

329
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,800
Where has he gone?

330
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Who did he meet?

331
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,200
Yes.

332
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Also,

333
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,800
I want you to bring someone to the capital.

334
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,800
But the master only asked me to protect your safety.

335
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,600
If I let you find this person,

336
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,200
if you fall into someone else's hands, you will be able to threaten my safety.

337
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
I understand.

338
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,800
You want to say that you will eliminate Jiang Yuehe and Jiang Li for me?

339
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Madam Ji, I have already said that you won't be able to get into the court.

340
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,800
My Li'er will soon reveal the ugly things you did.

341
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,800
I can help you eliminate him in here.

342
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,400
Let's see if you are willing to do it.

343
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,200
Madam,

344
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,400
I have already said that you will be able to get into the court.

345
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,800
I will not let you get into the court.

346
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
I will not let you get into the court.

347
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,200
I will not let you get into the court.

348
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,800
I will not let you get into the court.

349
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Madam, Ma Che and He Li are all ready.

350
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Madam.

351
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,800
If it's a difficult situation, you don't have to force yourself.

352
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,400
Since you have made the choice, you have to go to the bottom.

353
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Madam,

354
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
I have already said that you will not be able to get into the court.

355
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,800
I will not let you get into the court.

356
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
Madam,

357
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,400
Madam,

358
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,800
Madam,

359
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Madam,

360
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,600
Madam,

361
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,400
Madam,

362
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,600
You even offended Qi family.

363
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,840
You're so good at playing the badminton.

364
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,960
Father still can't change

365
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,400
the habit of picking troubles on others.

366
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,000
I pick troubles?

367
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,640
You're the most unhappy in the family.

368
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,440
You didn't leave the way of wealth

369
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
for so many times.

370
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,480
You're going to die in the dark.

371
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,560
If I didn't find you back,

372
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,680
you wouldn't have been able to take revenge on me today.

373
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,520
If you dare to approach my daughter again,

374
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,080
I'll let you die in the dark.

375
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,520
It's all my fault.

376
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,840
Please spare him.

377
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,360
Remember his whereabouts.

378
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,560
If you dare to defy my fate again,

379
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,560
I'll destroy you.

380
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,760
If not,

381
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,640
you can still be the current Prime Minister's wife.

382
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,000
Father, have you forgotten

383
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
how I became the Prime Minister's wife?

384
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,800
You wanted to sell me to a fool.

385
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,760
You said you'd marry a fool

386
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,800
and have a daughter in a few years.

387
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,920
You controlled the whole family.

388
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,120
When the rich and the rich are willing to use you,

389
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,000
you said you didn't marry a man

390
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,840
who doesn't have the right to talk.

391
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,600
I begged you not to marry him.

392
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,560
You said you'd find a better man

393
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,960
than him.

394
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Otherwise, I'd marry him.

395
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,440
You've found a better man.

396
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
Shuren, thank you for your hard work.

397
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,880
You're still here to accompany me every day.

398
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,480
We're sisters.

399
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,600
I'll accompany you until you recover.

400
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
I'm leaving.

401
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,040
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

402
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,320
Prime Minister, don't worry.

403
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,520
Madam's body is already recovering.

404
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,280
You don't agree with the marriage I arranged for you.

405
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,760
If you can't marry Jiang,

406
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,200
what else can you do?

407
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,960
The world is turning around.

408
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,200
I can't expect this.

409
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,960
The illness is very complicated.

410
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,480
If he makes some mistakes,

411
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,360
and makes his illness worse,

412
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,800
you can marry him.

413
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,440
How can that be?

414
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,960
You only have two options.

415
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,960
Either marry that Han Sha Prince

416
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,560
or make some mistakes

417
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,760
and become the real heir to Jiang Yuan Bai.

418
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,280
I think you should know what to choose.

419
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,960
You've made me like this step by step.

420
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,440
I should thank you, Father.

421
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,280
You've made me a villain.

422
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,720
You've made me want to kill people.

423
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,480
You've made me suffer.

424
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,040
Your problem is not vicious enough.

425
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,760
You're a little bit close to the original match you made for Jiang Yuan Bai.

426
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,400
But you made the mother die.

427
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,960
It's okay.

428
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,560
You made Jiang Li die.

429
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,320
You said you can't stand it.

430
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,360
Now they're all trying to harm you.

431
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,920
You're mistaken.

432
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,200
You're right.

433
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm not vicious enough.

434
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,960
So I think I know now.

435
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,920
I should be more vicious.

436
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,080
I'll take all the consequences.

437
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,360
What do you mean?

438
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Father.

439
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,280
Isn't it hard to drink this tea?

440
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,280
Father, have a good cup of tea.

441
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,080
What do you want?

442
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,400
Liu Wen Cai is back.

443
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,600
He's been very cruel to me since he came back.

444
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,720
What?

445
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,120
He said he could help me get Jiang Li out.

446
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,200
But he wants me to help him first.

447
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,720
So I'll take his revenge.

448
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,920
Back then, your father shot me to death.

449
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,660
But he lost myplaying my fingers.

450
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,460
Let me be so decent with this Spielberg.

451
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,780
First, I want him die.

452
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,680
Only after he wrote itSub voleo.

453
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,760
I'll wait and see.

454
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,640
What?

455
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,520
This is the reason you came back to me.

456
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,560
Didn't you say that you were not cruel enough?

457
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,080
I can be a coward now.

458
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,600
I just need to hold my father's arm and then cut off another head.

459
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,320
What is he?

460
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,040
He asked me to cut off his arm and let me cut off his head.

461
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,960
Does he deserve it?

462
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,800
He deserves it.

463
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,480
He is now the crown prince's crown prince.

464
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,400
If he is a little eight-hearted crown prince,

465
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,800
can he still be afraid of him?

466
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,400
He is the princess of Wanning Sect.

467
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,240
Moreover, the crown prince's order is to make up for the wrongdoings.

468
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,360
Although the official position is not high, he can still be a courtier.

469
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,920
How can that be?

470
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,960
My daughter is still the most favored concubine in the court.

471
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,160
So you are now living with your two daughters.

472
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,960
How dare you think we are not cruel enough?

473
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,960
Today, I will show my father.

474
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,240
I will first cut off your arm and then drag you.

475
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,040
Then I will go to the entrance of Liu Wencai's house.

476
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,360
Liu Wencai has been missing for so many years.

477
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,680
Now he suddenly comes to the door with the crown prince's order.

478
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,040
Who knows what he is thinking about?

479
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,800
You can't be blinded by him.

480
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,600
I am your father, your father, your biological father.

481
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,360
Shuran.

482
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,440
Shuran.

483
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,560
Shuran.

484
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,160
Shuran.

485
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,640
Listen to me.

486
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,920
Shuran.

487
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,120
When your mother left,

488
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,040
I didn't even think about letting you two go.

489
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,680
I didn't even think about letting you two go.

490
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:55,360
How can you do that for your father?

491
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,040
My good daughter, you can't be so stupid.

492
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,320
Shuran.

493
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,040
Shuran.

494
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,800
Shuran.

495
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,880
It seems I am going to let my father down again.

496
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,800
I still can't do what you want.

497
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Shuran.

498
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,320
Shuran.

499
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,920
Shuran.

500
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,120
Shuran, where is he?

501
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,600
Samdi.

502
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,280
What.

503
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,320
What are you doing?

504
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,520
Who are you?

505
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,320
I don't believe it.

506
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Give it to me.

507
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,920
I don't want to see it.

508
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
I'll kill you with these dead people.

509
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,720
I'll kill you.

510
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,320
Are you that kind of person?

511
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
Second Madam.

512
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,320
Do you know the rules of Jiangzhai?

513
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,920
Second Madam misunderstood.

514
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
Just now, aunt and I were having a meal.

515
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,520
I was busy with the work.

516
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,720
Third Madam, I know that you treat the master like this.

517
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,520
I'll send you back to Jiangzhai.

518
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
And praise you in front of the old woman.

519
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,520
Second Madam, I'm sorry.

520
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,920
I know I was wrong.

521
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Hurry and take your master to the house.

522
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,520
Yes.

523
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,720
Aunt.

524
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
Aunt.

525
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,920
Aunt, let's go.

526
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,720
The ancestral land

527
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,720
is so big for you.

528
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
The monthly salary in the house is sent here secretly.

529
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,520
The winter is so hot.

530
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,720
The fire is not up.

531
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,320
The window is broken.

532
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,920
I should ask you for a tent to see.

533
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,320
Yes.

534
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,320
But I don't feel cold.

535
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,720
I didn't use it to burn the fire.

536
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
I brought some tonics for Aunt Hu.

537
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,920
Tong'er, let her learn

538
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,320
how to serve the master.

539
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,120
Yes.

540
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,320
Let's go.

541
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,320
Don't be afraid, Yu'er.

542
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Yu'er.

543
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Don't be afraid.

544
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Yu'er.

545
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,920
Don't be afraid.

546
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
Aunt Hu.

547
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,320
The person is gone.

548
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,920
We can talk about it.

549
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,320
My Yu'er is cold.

550
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,520
Cold.

551
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Cold.

552
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Cold.

553
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Yu'er.

554
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,720
I've only come once.

555
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,120
Are you sure you want to pretend?

556
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,720
Why did you come to me?

557
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,520
You didn't come to save me, did you?

558
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,920
I want to hear

559
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,920
the story of you and Yu'er.

560
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,120
What did you know?

561
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,920
You asked me so many times.

562
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,920
Yu'er's death

563
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,520
was so hard to understand.

564
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,120
If you come to tell me this,

565
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,520
I won't say anything.

566
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,920
I came here without any trouble.

567
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,320
I've been friends with my mother.

568
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
I remember

569
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
when I was little, she used to hug me.

570
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,520
Yu'er treated me well.

571
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,520
As for the truth,

572
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,320
I left Jiang's family for so many years.

573
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,920
I don't remember much.

574
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,680
But I saw her

575
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,920
so close.

576
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,320
Since she didn't want to tell you about it,

577
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,520
I told you about my story.

578
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,920
I was wronged

579
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,920
by my family.

580
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
I was sent to the mountains of Qingcheng for ten years.

581
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,920
Qingcheng Mountain

582
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,320
is colder than this place.

583
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,120
I've been asking for it for ten years.

584
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,320
It's so cold and cold.

585
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,920
I've been through it for a long time.

586
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,120
I can't see it.

587
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,720
But I don't want to admit it.

588
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,320
If it's fate,

589
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,320
I must be punished.

590
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
Because I'm wronged,

591
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,920
I won't bow down.

592
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,520
Why do those evil people

593
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,320
have to be hurt?

594
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,920
Those who are killed

595
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,720
must be killed in a moment.

596
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,920
So I'm going down from the mountain

597
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
and back to the capital

598
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,720
and stand in front of the world.

599
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,320
Aunt Hu,

600
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,520
you pretended to be alive.

601
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,920
But you've been in pain every day

602
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,720
and can't get out of my daughter's life.

603
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,120
First of all, what's the difference between you living and dying?

604
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
You're as wronged as I am.

605
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,720
I hope you can stand up.

606
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,320
I'll help you.

607
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,320
I also have the ability to help you.

608
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,720
I've finished my words.

609
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,320
I'll have to make a lot of trouble.

610
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,920
My daughter was killed.

611
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,920
My daughter was killed.

612
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,920
Second Lady,

613
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,320
she was killed.

614
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,320
She was killed.

615
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,320
Second Lady, please help me.

616
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,320
I've been waiting for you for so long.

617
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,320
Why are you still here alone?

618
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,920
What are you doing?

619
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,720
Didn't you want my father to admit his mistake?

620
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,920
I'll kneel for him.

621
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,720
You seem to have made a mistake.

622
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,720
I want him to keep his word.

623
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,320
Then I'll kneel for him.

624
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,720
You're wrong.

625
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,320
I want him to keep his word.

626
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,720
Then I'll kneel for him.

627
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,320
I'll kneel for him.

628
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,720
I'll kneel for him.

629
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,320
I'll kneel for him.

630
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
I'll kneel for him.

631
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
Do it.

632
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Did you forget the battle you fought?

633
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,320
You mean I'll give you my life?

634
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,120
You owe me.

635
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,920
How many lives can you give me?

636
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,120
You said I was the cause of my life.

637
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,320
If I follow his instructions,

638
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,320
I'll be in trouble.

639
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,320
He called me a coward.

640
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,320
He ate my cold and ate my food and drink.

641
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,320
I think it's the compensation God gave me.

642
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,320
But I didn't expect that the bigger the punishment,

643
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
the more I started.

644
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
This is also a part of the cultivation.

645
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,720
I can't bear it.

646
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,720
You can kneel.

647
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,120
After the fire,

648
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,120
what can Tang Yong do?

649
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,920
He said others were bleeding.

650
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,120
But he was in the body and was in the blood.

651
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,720
And he was in the blood.

652
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,920
He transferred the blood to the fire and revived me.

653
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,320
He was completely dead.

654
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,320
The more I bleed, the more blood I get.

655
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,720
The more the officials believe us.

656
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,120
After all, no one can be so cruel.

657
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,320
The royal family are willing to pay more for this.

658
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,320
They are so close to each other.

659
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,920
We have a lot of dreams in the capital.

660
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,120
That's why we met the princess.

661
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,520
I like the way you live.

662
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,320
There is a control room in the Ministry of Rites.

663
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,520
You can make up one of my doors.

664
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
You can discuss it.

665
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,120
I like the new and old.

666
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,520
I like the one with the most heart.

667
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,920
You want to die long ago.

668
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Then you should be killed.

669
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,520
From now on, I will do everything for you.

670
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,320
But I decided to live.

671
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,520
I won't die easily.

672
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,120
I can't be Georgian anymore.

673
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,920
You think it's funny?

674
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Don't be rude.

675
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,920
OK, we live it, not criticism.

676
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,920
Under the note of the honorary princess,

677
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Can you?

678
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,520
I have to.

679
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,720
I married him back then.

680
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
And I have Ruoyou.

681
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,120
Your father found out about you.

682
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
I begged him

683
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,920
to let me see you for the last time.

684
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,120
You don't need to mention the past.

685
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,920
Let me think

686
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,920
how to make you feel better.

687
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Do you know why I want to get rid of Jiang Li?

688
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,720
I don't want to know.

689
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,520
"'Nan bientôt d beide grat Warum apologize degere'

690
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:55,960
ลs osobyן

691
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,520
If Yu'er falls off the cliff,

692
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,400
it's not a 100,000RMB.

693
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,520
From the day I entered the palace, I felt that this woman was not right.

694
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,400
So beautiful?

695
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,680
This is the eldest daughter of the Jiang family, Jiang Yue.

696
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,520
She's so cute.

697
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,760
Although she looks like a big fan of Wen Wen,

698
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,080
she's also very nice to Yu'er.

699
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,200
But I just think that she doesn't look like a simple person.

700
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,200
I thought that she was far away from Yu'er.

701
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,800
But I never thought that something would happen.

702
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,400
Sister, play with me for a while.

703
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,600
I won't give it to you.

704
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Sister, play with me for a while.

705
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,600
I won't play with you.

706
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,200
Sister, play with me for a while.

707
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,000
Get up.

708
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Why are you crying?

709
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You want to go and rob yourself?

710
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Give it to me.

711
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,400
This is what my mother made for me.

712
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
I'm crying.

713
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
I won't give it to you!

714
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,400
Ji Shuren asked Su Mama to take Yu'er to the fake mountain.

715
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,400
She made Yu'er walk out of the fake mountain and fell down.

716
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,000
She then lost her life's fake blood.

717
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,400
Xiao Zhuang Zhuang didn't look like she had anything to do with her.

718
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,000
My daughter died like this in Ji Shuren's hands.

719
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,400
You weren't there then.

720
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
How did you know?

721
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,400
I reported to the previous maid.

722
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,200
That day, she was following Yu'er.

723
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,800
She went to the kitchen to feed the children.

724
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,000
When she came back,

725
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,400
I heard Ji Shuren's order to make a move on her.

726
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,600
You ran back and told me.

727
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Where is Baoqing now?

728
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,200
She committed a crime.

729
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,400
After Yu'er died,

730
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,200
Ji Shuren said that she wouldn't be able to bear the consequences.

731
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,400
So she drove her out of the Jiang family.

732
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,600
She never had any chance to get away from this.

733
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,800
You knew about this at that time.

734
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,600
Why didn't you only testify to Ji Shuren?

735
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,000
Only testify?

736
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,800
Second Madam, you've been back to the Jiang family for so long.

737
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,800
How could you still ask me such a question?

738
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,200
What kind of place is the Jiang family?

739
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,600
You should know better than me.

740
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,800
Just like you were sent to Zhenyu Hall.

741
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,200
Didn't you change?

742
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,000
Didn't you only testify to Ji Shuren?

743
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Did anyone believe what you said?

744
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,400
Ji Shuren said that because she lost Yu'er,

745
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,000
she got a stroke and she was able to avoid it.

746
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
She was not in danger.

747
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,400
She was fine.

748
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,800
She was just fine.

749
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,000
She was also in a state of weakness and a state of suspicion.

750
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,200
But I...

751
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,000
became that person who was not a good person.

752
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,400
If it wasn't for my wife's stubbornness and love for me,

753
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,800
I would have been sent to Zhenyu Hall.

754
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Later, I was sent to Ji Shuren.

755
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,400
I pretended to be cured.

756
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,200
The Jiang family couldn't keep me as a lunatic.

757
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,400
They sent me here.

758
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,200
That's why I was able to avoid it.

759
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,200
The whole Jiang family...

760
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,000
didn't have anyone to suspect.

761
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,600
She is the wife of the Ji family.

762
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,000
The current wife of the Zheng family.

763
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
She is gentle and generous. She is virtuous and virtuous.

764
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Who would believe that she would not love her

765
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,600
and kill her own wife?

766
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,800
Even if someone feels strange,

767
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,200
the Ji family at that time was in a fight.

768
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,800
There was also a decent Consort Li who was a demon.

769
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,000
Who would have offended the Ji family

770
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,200
for a dead person?

771
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,000
Second Madam, you are also in the Jiang family.

772
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,200
You are kind and righteous.

773
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,400
You are prouder than me.

774
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,000
If I may do anything wrong,

775
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I will surely cause Yu be Honda during the occasional drought.

776
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,100
Didn't you say that you want my mother to wage war on your children?

777
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,040
And how dare you!

778
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,800
lying at your own無法說你說我誤會了

779
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,100
a bloody show

780
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,500
for your safety

781
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,260
Thank you, Yue

782
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,840
As long as Mom shows discipline

783
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,080
my power might be greater

784
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,100
a demon

785
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,200
Put your power down

786
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,080
Good

787
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,800
Who consumes so much food?

788
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,280
A demon

789
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,040
a demon

790
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,500
A demon

791
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,180
They trample upon you

792
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:32,680
Why?

793
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,680
Why do you hinder them?

794
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:34,720
With your authority

795
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,520
Great.

796
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,520
Being a mother

797
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,040
is a child's priority.

798
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,280
Di'er, go inside.

799
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,160
Don't be touched by the wind and rain.

800
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,320
Mother, please.

801
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,080
I won't leave you alone.

802
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,840
ada.

803
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,560
Sister.

804
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,440
Madam.

805
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,000
What's wrong?

806
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,000
A servant sent a message

807
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,400
saying that there is a residence for the Hu Yi Niang in Jiangli.

808
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,800
They said they had a good conversation.

809
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,040
But Hu Yi Niang didn't make any trouble.

810
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,800
It seems that this time,

811
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,560
she is going to fight with me.

812
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,480
A good Hu Yi Niang

813
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,800
has been pretending to be a fool for so many years.

814
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,920
But it's really hard for her.

815
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,360
Then shall we take that Hu Yi Niang?

816
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,680
That Hu Yi Niang?

817
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,640
Jiangli has found her.

818
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,160
She will naturally let people see her in the future.

819
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,840
A drunkard who used to kill his mother.

820
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,080
A crazy and crazy aunt.

821
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,960
If they were together,

822
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,080
they would have lost their lives.

823
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,240
Mr. Jiangli.

824
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
Younger Sister.

825
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,840
It's time to eat.

826
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,760
Madam has prepared

827
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,600
some calming sacred water.

828
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,800
Let's have some drink.

829
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,780
She loves you even more.

830
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,680
She wouldn't be the one to scold you,

831
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,500
because you love your grandma.

832
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,940
You're my only hope,

833
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,140
if you don't say anything,

834
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,300
she won't accept you.

835
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,900
I'll do whatever you want to do.

836
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,980
Mother Sun, you...

837
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,720
Third Miss.

838
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,840
It's all done for your good.

839
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,780
After you wake up,

840
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,680
everything will be good for you!

841
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,400
What did you do?

842
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,040
What did you do?

843
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,640
Tell me.

844
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,880
My wife is pregnant.

845
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,680
My wife is pregnant.

846
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,680
I'm so sorry.

847
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,360
I'm sorry.

848
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,040
I'm sorry.

849
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,840
My wife is pregnant.

850
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,560
Is your mother's mother

851
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,560
doing this for your own good?

852
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,520
What did the doctor say?

853
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,880
He asked a few doctors.

854
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,360
They said they didn't have any problems

855
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,360
after seeing the doctor.

856
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,840
They didn't have any symptoms.

857
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,360
As for the good people,

858
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,360
why did they turn into this light?

859
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,360
They can't say it clearly.

860
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
Lord.

861
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
Please tell me.

862
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,360
To be honest,

863
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,360
I don't understand what you said.

864
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,360
I'm so angry with you.

865
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,360
I'm so angry with you.

866
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,360
I'm so angry with you.

867
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,360
I'm so angry with you.

868
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,360
I'm so angry with my family.

869
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,360
I'm so angry with you.

870
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,360
Mother.

871
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

872
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,360
I'm too big for the three-day marriage.

873
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,360
Now she's like a mother.

874
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,360
How could I say nonsense?

875
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,360
Although I'm just

876
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,360
a fool.

877
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,360
But I'm not

878
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,360
a person who can't die

879
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,360
without a reason.

880
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,360
Lord.

881
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,360
I'm afraid I should find the three-day marriage.

882
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,360
But the whole city is busy.

883
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,360
How could I find

884
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,360
such a smart doctor?

885
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,360
The monster is so cunning.

886
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
She's so ridiculous.

887
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,360
If you don't have anything else to do,

888
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,760
don't let those

889
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,360
pretending to be ghosts

890
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,360
to make people think of you.

891
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,360
What should I do?

892
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,360
The blood is broken.

893
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,360
The illness of the monster

894
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,360
is really strange.

895
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,360
It's good to see.

896
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,360
Since you've decided,

897
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,360
just listen to her.

898
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,360
I'm going to write a letter to the Tai Paling.

899
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,360
Mother.

900
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,360
You should take care of yourself.

901
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,360
It's still a good day

902
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,360
to go out of the monster.

903
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
Don't worry.

904
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,360
Madam.

905
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,360
The matter of the three wives.

906
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,360
Do you believe it?

907
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,360
The monster is so cunning.

908
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,360
It's the matter of the heaven and the earth.

909
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,360
I can't see it.

910
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,360
But the person who's making trouble.

911
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,360
I'll finally

912
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,360
understand the truth.

913
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,360
I'll go to the Tai Paling.

914
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,360
I'll go to the Tai Paling.

915
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,360
I'll go to the Tai Paling.

916
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,360
I'll go to the Tai Paling.

917
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,360
I'll go to the Tai Paling.

918
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,360
I'll go to the Tai Paling.

919
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,360
I'll go to the Tai Paling.

920
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,360
I'll understand.

921
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,360
Go back to Jiangxiang.

922
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,360
I'll be there tomorrow.

923
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,360
Yes.

924
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,360
Ghost.

925
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,360
This one.

926
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360
Xiaoling, there's a ghost.

927
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,360
There's a ghost.

928
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,360
What's wrong?

929
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,360
Where's the ghost?

930
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,360
You don't know.

931
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
Something big happened.

932
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,360
Jiang Ruo Yao broke his shoes.

933
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,360
And he woke up in the Tai Paling.

934
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,360
He's going to the Tai Paling.

935
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,360
Tai Paling?

936
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,360
This Tai Paling.

937
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,360
He broke his shoes.

938
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,360
It's the King of the King of the Wu Qing.

939
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,360
What he said is right.

940
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,360
What's going on in the court recently?

941
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,360
A few days ago,

942
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,360
the harem kept dying.

943
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,360
Today, four maids

944
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,360
and tomorrow, four maids.

945
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,360
The palace was full of bandits.

946
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,360
They said there were bandits in the palace.

947
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,360
Then,

948
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,360
they asked the Tai Paling to get rid of the bandits.

949
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,360
The Tai Paling said

950
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,360
the bandits were dead.

951
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,360
But the emperor didn't have mercy.

952
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,360
He gave up the wine that day.

953
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,360
The poor concubine in the palace

954
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,360
didn't even have the chance to change herself.

955
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,360
She was...

956
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,360
Do you think the Tai Paling

957
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,360
can catch the bandits

958
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,360
if we come to Jiangjie?

959
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,360
They're here.

960
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,360
They won't back down.

961
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,360
They?

962
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,360
Do you really think

963
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,360
Jiang Ruo Yao broke his shoes?

964
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,360
I see.

965
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,360
If you say so,

966
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,360
the technical department will be so cruel.

967
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,360
You're using your daughter as a knife.

968
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,360
Except for you, Jiangjie,

969
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,360
who else can break the ice?

970
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,360
I'm going to

971
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,360
break this ice this time.
