1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm lonely in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't know

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly stop crying

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Waiting for spring to sunlight

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
уг Paste

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 18

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,460
Hope everybody is

16
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,180
Then go to the Three-Star Camp.

17
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,860
Only when you get to the Three-Star Camp

18
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,140
can you survive.

19
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,300
I love you.

20
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,780
Don't be anxious.

21
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,020
Don't be anxious.

22
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,780
Don't be anxious.

23
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,500
Everyone is here.

24
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,380
Thank you.

25
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,180
Thank you.

26
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,900
Thank you.

27
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,780
Thank you.

28
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,740
Thank you.

29
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,980
Did you see anything?

30
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,500
Did you see anything?

31
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,620
The location is wrong.

32
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,180
What location?

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,980
The people who asked me

34
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,500
to look for me.

35
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,700
What do you mean?

36
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,820
Uncle San.

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,060
We've been on the road

38
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,500
from Huaixiang to Dingzhou.

39
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,980
And our horses are all good.

40
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,020
So the name of my life

41
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,380
is naturally transmitted by ordinary people.

42
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,260
The speed of transmission

43
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,580
is slower than ours.

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,500
According to the factory,

45
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,420
when we go out of Dingzhou,

46
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,700
the people of Dingzhou will hear my name.

47
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,140
You said it's from the factory.

48
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,580
But now these people

49
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,900
are trying to find you.

50
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,700
But the location of my name is wrong.

51
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,180
Uncle San, think about it.

52
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,420
When we came to Dingzhou,

53
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,220
there were a lot of people

54
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,700
who wanted to look for me.

55
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,700
Most of them came from the outside.

56
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,700
They have no conscience.

57
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,660
They all came here

58
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,180
because of their legs.

59
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,180
And the farthest one

60
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,700
came from Ningzhou.

61
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,060
Indeed.

62
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,060
Look.

63
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,940
From Ningzhou to Dingzhou,

64
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,980
if we go out together,

65
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,260
we won't be able to stay up all night.

66
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,380
Now we're...

67
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,180
We've just arrived at Dingzhou.

68
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,940
So some people are focused on these people.

69
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,020
They want to send us to Dingzhou.

70
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,540
And the only one

71
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,140
who was killed in Liangda City

72
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,140
and the Ningzhou on the west side of the capital,

73
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,620
the line of the street,

74
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,940
is only dangerous.

75
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,740
Uncle San.

76
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,580
I'll go find Liu Gong.

77
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:46,820
This...

78
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,660
Miss Jiang.

79
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,140
We found three places

80
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,220
where the disaster relief registration was done.

81
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,900
Shangdu, Ningzhou, and Weixian.

82
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,100
Most of the people in Weixian

83
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,180
are from the half of the city.

84
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,260
Half of them are from Dingzhou.

85
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,780
Weixian has been missing so many people.

86
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,340
I guess

87
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,300
there will be a problem.

88
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,900
I think we've left

89
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,900
so many people in Weixian.

90
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,860
But the local county magistrate

91
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,980
is not informed at all.

92
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,460
I guess the county magistrate

93
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,420
is in a bad mood

94
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,740
and is worried about the people's stomach.

95
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,380
Plus, some people

96
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,740
are sending you to live in the capital.

97
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,660
That's why so many people

98
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,060
come from Dingzhou.

99
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,700
Maybe the county magistrate

100
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,300
is being used by someone.

101
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,500
Maybe there's something wrong with Weixian.

102
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,740
To be honest,

103
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,020
I also suspect that Weixian has a problem.

104
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,740
Someone is trying to kill the people.

105
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,660
We'll be careful.

106
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,980
If we can catch two people,

107
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,380
the one who lead the trouble

108
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,700
and interrogate them,

109
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,780
they might find their mastermind.

110
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,620
Last night, I thought about it

111
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,500
when I was in the palace.

112
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,660
But these bad guys

113
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,740
are really cunning.

114
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,060
If we find them in the crowd,

115
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,660
it's really hard.

116
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,420
No need to go to the city.

117
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,340
Let's make a situation

118
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,300
and lure them out.

119
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,100
A situation?

120
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,060
What situation?

121
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,500
Liu,

122
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,180
I want to go out to the city.

123
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,260
Go out to the city?

124
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,260
No.

125
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:11,980
It's too dangerous.

126
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,740
We can't go.

127
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,180
We can't go.

128
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,380
You can't go.

129
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,260
You can't go.

130
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,020
Stop.

131
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,740
Guys,

132
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,460
I know this guy.

133
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,580
He's with the second wife.

134
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,780
The second wife is a car.

135
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:41,820
Guys,

136
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,260
we can't let her go.

137
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,940
No one can stop us.

138
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,740
What do you think the second wife is?

139
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,180
She's like you.

140
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,340
She's a soft talker in the crowd.

141
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,260
Let me tell you.

142
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,780
The second wife is going to the city to get some food.

143
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,860
If anyone dares to stop her,

144
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,260
don't blame me for not keeping the gun.

145
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,900
These officials are the best at deceiving people.

146
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
They're going to starve to death.

147
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,380
Let's fight.

148
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,740
Made a cash return.

149
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,580
deexpl אתה.

150
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,140
Yes,

151
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,660
these are all deceivers.

152
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,540
What should we do?

153
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,300
Deąda.

154
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,300
Deunda.

155
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,980
That's right.

156
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,780
DEoma.

157
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,220
I...

158
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,740
It's you?

159
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,340
Is it you?

160
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,020
Is it you?

161
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,900
Or it's you?

162
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,040
Let's go.

163
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,320
Arrest the Porter organizing at my place!

164
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:09,380

wrong person,

174
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,280
Let's go.

175
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,540
I'll go with you.

176
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,020
I'll keep you safe.

177
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,620
If I want to leave,

178
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,300
I can leave yesterday.

179
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,220
But now, it's me...

180
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,460
I don't want to leave.

181
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,540
He's recovered.

182
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,180
No.

183
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,780
Then why do you listen to a person who doesn't know the truth?

184
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,020
Duke Su.

185
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,020
Duke Su.

186
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,020
Duke Su.

187
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,020
Duke Su.

188
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,020
Duke Su.

189
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,020
Duke Su.

190
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,820
Duke Su.

191
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,820
Duke Su.

192
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,820
Duke Su.

193
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,820
Duke Su.

194
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Duke Su.

195
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Duke Su.

196
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,740
Please follow me, Your Highness.

197
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,820
I'm the reason

198
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,180
that Ding Zhou

199
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,900
because of me.

200
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,100
I can't leave here alone.

201
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,420
Moreover,

202
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,340
there's a rumor now.

203
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,300
It's when Chousi was released.

204
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,660
I'm not late.

205
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,900
Did you forget what's more important

206
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,500
to you now?

207
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,260
I know better than anyone.

208
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,980
Dingzhou and Huai Xiang's people are different.

209
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,020
They're all killed by the destruction.

210
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,740
Xue Xianling's family's disaster

211
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,540
is the result of the struggle.

212
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,580
It's just that

213
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,060
the solution for Xue family is not enough.

214
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,500
It's even more so to dig out the real Black Hand behind.

215
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,020
Only then

216
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,220
will there be a second,

217
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,340
third,

218
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,260
and fourth Xue family.

219
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,780
You've made up your mind?

220
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,620
Yes.

221
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,340
Then I'll take you out.

222
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
Why did the Su State Palace

223
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,020
appear here yesterday?

224
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,900
You go ask him yourself.

225
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,060
I don't dare to ask him.

226
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,980
But I think you two are quite familiar.

227
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,420
How could you not know?

228
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,540
No wonder Ye Shijie knows how to close the door.

229
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,820
You're not in the mood.

230
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,100
So you've used it in this way.

231
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,740
I...

232
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,740
It's normal for people.

233
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,020
Jiang Jingrui is not in the government.

234
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,740
Why are you looking at me like that?

235
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,700
Forget it.

236
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,820
I won't talk to you.

237
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,660
I'll go ask my father.

238
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
Do you find anyone?

239
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,020
Liu Xun.

240
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,860
Do you know me too well?

241
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,660
We've confirmed it.

242
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,940
Dingzhou's chaos

243
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,660
was caused by Lu Ziyun in Wei County.

244
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,860
They've sent the court's witness

245
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,860
to arrest Dingzhou.

246
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,860
Liu, you know what to do, right?

247
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,420
Thank you for your help.

248
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,220
I understand.

249
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,860
I'll take care of the Wei County.

250
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,580
You can tell Dingzhou's arrest.

251
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,100
Yes, Duke Su.

252
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,460
I told you he had a problem.

253
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,780
He must have.

254
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,660
Let go of me.

255
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,060
You're a bad guy.

256
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,540
Get lost.

257
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,660
Have you handled the situation in Huaixiang?

258
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,340
No.

259
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,700
Why are you here so soon?

260
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,060
What do you think?

261
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,180
I have to remind you.

262
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,860
After you find Xue Huaiyuan,

263
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,420
you're in a bad mood.

264
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,260
Burn a piece of it.

265
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,460
It won't harm you.

266
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,300
Okay.

267
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,060
I'm leaving.

268
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,020
I'm leaving.

269
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,660
I have nothing to say.

270
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,940
Be careful

271
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,220
when you leave tomorrow.

272
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,420
That's a good thing.

273
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,940
Jiang Erniang.

274
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,500
Jianz Thinking for a Life

275
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,580
He's not scared.

276
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,740
Jianzhi is not scared.

277
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,380
mobilizing his phrase

278
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,380
as the medicine at its service

279
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,260
would help her recover from her family's Lot of problems

280
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,620
Liu Xun.

281
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,940
The food

282
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,540
are all here.

283
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,700
I don't think so.

284
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,220
It's rare to see you so serious.

285
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,260
It's really something to be concerned about.

286
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,020
What do you think

287
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,940
I used to be?

288
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,980
You used to be so carefree

289
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,900
and uneducated.

290
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,500
I didn't expect that you'd come across something

291
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,020
that you're reliable.

292
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,980
I'm not.

293
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,020
I've always been reliable, okay?

294
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,180
I'll give you all the food.

295
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,740
Is he going to confess to me?

296
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,260
What's wrong?

297
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,060
You're too weak.

298
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,620
When will you move the stuff?

299
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
You didn't eat again.

300
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,420
Yes.

301
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,860
You haven't eaten for days?

302
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,540
Yes.

303
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,660
I haven't eaten for a while.

304
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,100
You haven't eaten for a while?

305
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,420
I'm discussing with Moliang.

306
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,860
You're not allowed to disturb me.

307
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,220
It's not like this.

308
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,860
You'd better eat something.

309
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,860
It's important to you.

310
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,540
I don't want to.

311
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,740
Is the way to Dingzhou different?

312
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,860
Madam Nan Wei is also thinking about it.

313
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,860
The news that came from outside

314
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,260
said that the people of Dingzhou

315
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,740
have blocked the city gate.

316
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,980
The people inside can't get out.

317
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,380
Li Zhongnan is unwilling to let go.

318
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,780
They want to kill Li'er.

319
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,460
The Ye family has gone to Dingzhou.

320
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,340
They shouldn't have done this to Li'er.

321
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,660
So I'm not only worried about this.

322
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,380
Even if the way to Dingzhou is in pain,

323
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,140
what should they do after they return to the capital?

324
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,140
They beg for mercy.

325
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Will the Prime Minister let go of Li'er?

326
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,820
Will Li Zhongnan let go of me?

327
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,820
Stop.

328
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,500
Who's there?

329
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,400
Get away.

330
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,860
To fallenusa.

331
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,220
Master, there did be rain in Yang excellency.

332
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,260
It's from the imperial garden of the настро.

333
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,420
But Lu Ziyun ran?

334
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,140
The food is done.

335
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,940
Not much.

336
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,820
But it should be worth it.

337
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,780
But it's all so smooth.

338
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,380
The food is not burnt.

339
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,180
We didn't get the obvious.

340
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,780
It's all waiting for us.

341
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,460
Do you think I think too much?

342
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,860
We're in the dark.

343
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,420
Shouldn't we do it smoothly?

344
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,020
The fishing is gone.

345
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,140
Why can't we sell it?

346
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,900
I said we can't sell it for double the price.

347
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,860
The wild wolf is not what I want to sell.

348
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,740
Lu Yang's food stock

349
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,580
was just sold to the court.

350
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,100
The food in our stock

351
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,020
is all the food from the court.

352
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,780
Now it's closed and waiting to be sold.

353
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,220
You said it's for you.

354
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,940
It's not sold for the government.

355
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,340
But it's to kill the head.

356
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:28,940
But...

357
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,980
Senior,

358
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,260
take it away first.

359
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,460
Let's go to another house.

360
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,180
Everyone,

361
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,020
we really don't dare to sell the food.

362
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,220
How much is it? Open the price.

363
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,940
It's not about the money.

364
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,700
Our brothers said it's a fraud on the way.

365
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,020
They're trying to find out the truth.

366
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,580
What if we're the one who's trying to sell the food?

367
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,100
Who would say the truth?

368
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,940
We used to sell the goods from you.

369
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,460
Business is not like this.

370
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,500
Senior,

371
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,620
let's go.

372
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,580
We can't go back and sell the goods.

373
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,700
Let's see if it's enough.

374
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:06,940
Yes.

375
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,700
Officer Yang,

376
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,860
we don't know where they are.

377
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,620
We have to check the stock market by the market.

378
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,740
Excellent.

379
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,220
Okay.

380
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,140
We'll try to investigate them.

381
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,420
Yes.

382
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,460
General,

383
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,700
what business do you have?

384
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,700
They were taken out of the woods in Lu Yang.

385
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
But the land was not built.

386
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
So...

387
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,700
The land in Dingzhou is...

388
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
the only land that has no source.

389
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
It's in Gaoyang.

390
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,700
Li Xiangguo.

391
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Everyone has a place to go.

392
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Hurry up.

393
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
You're so wrong.

394
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,700
Don't be so wrong.

395
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,700
What's wrong with you?

396
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
I told you that everyone has a place to go.

397
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,700
Everyone has a place to go.

398
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Don't be so anxious.

399
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Thank you.

400
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Thank you.

401
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
You can fight here.

402
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Everyone has a place to go.

403
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Everyone has a place to go.

404
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Don't be so anxious.

405
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,700
You can fight here.

406
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
I'll fight for you.

407
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
I'm starving to death.

408
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
I'm starving to death.

409
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Everyone come here and see.

410
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
I'm starving to death.

411
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
Come here and see.

412
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,700
The old town in Chengzhou is so new.

413
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
If we continue like this,

414
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
we'll all starve to death.

415
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Yes.

416
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
What's wrong with you?

417
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
What's wrong?

418
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Who's this?

419
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
It's so new.

420
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,700
How can we starve to death?

421
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Yes.

422
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
We're all starving to death.

423
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
And,

424
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
did you all go to Dingzhou

425
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,700
to save the people outside the city?

426
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,700
No.

427
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,700
Don't talk nonsense.

428
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,700
What about Liang?

429
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Didn't you all live up to her?

430
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
Why didn't you all come out?

431
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
Did we all die?

432
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
Yes.

433
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
Everyone calm down.

434
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,700
No.

435
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Everyone calm down.

436
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
We came to Dingzhou.

437
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,700
We only believed that

438
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,700
the second wife came.

439
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
But after we came,

440
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
we were still starving to death.

441
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
Now we're starving to death.

442
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
We want to see the second wife.

443
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Ask the second wife to come out.

444
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,700
Everyone calm down.

445
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Everyone calm down.

446
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
Everyone calm down.

447
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,700
Everyone calm down.

448
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,700
Is that okay?

449
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
I'll get out.

450
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Everyone calm down.

451
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
Sister Liu.

452
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
Go.

453
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Go.

454
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,700
Everyone listen to me.

455
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
First calm down.

456
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
The second wife.

457
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Open the door.

458
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
Everyone, go outside.

459
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
The outside city has a lot of soldiers.

460
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Open the door.

461
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
We don't have enough people.

462
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
Open the door.

463
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Is that right?

464
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Everyone calm down.

465
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
Everyone calm down.

466
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Listen to me.

467
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,700
This is not what you thought.

468
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,700
A'Li.

469
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Go to the county office with me.

470
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
The outside city has gathered more and more people.

471
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
Everyone is trying to get you out.

472
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,700
I'm afraid that there will be people in the city.

473
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
It seems that those who tried to kill the people in the case

474
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,700
haven't finished catching them.

475
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,700
They can't wait to get out.

476
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,700
Liu Xu and my brother Tang

477
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
are not in the city gate.

478
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
How are they?

479
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,700
I heard that General Rui was trapped outside the city.

480
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
What?

481
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,700
Third brother.

482
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,700
Take Xue Xianling to the county office.

483
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
I'm going out.

484
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
These people are coming from you.

485
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,700
Zheng Ying is like that.

486
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
I can't let my brother Tang take me out.

487
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
How about

488
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,700
let Tong Er take Xue Xianling to the county office.

489
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,700
I'll go out with you.

490
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Third brother.

491
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Maybe there will be some danger next.

492
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
When did you fear danger?

493
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,700
Even if the mountain is alive,

494
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,700
I'll go out with you.

495
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
Everyone, calm down.

496
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
It's Second Mother.

497
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,700
It's Second Mother.

498
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,700
It's Second Mother.

499
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,700
It's Second Mother.

500
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Second Mother finally came out.

501
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Huang Gu is here.

502
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Save us.

503
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Save these people in Li Xiang.

504
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Save us.

505
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Be quiet.

506
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,700
Get up.

507
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Get up.

508
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Everyone.

509
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
I know that

510
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,700
Dingzhou is very busy now.

511
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:21,280
The

512
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:38,700
business is still booming.

513
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:46,700
What should we do.

514
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,700
How will they do it.

515
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
What should we do.

516
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
Shut up.

517
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
What's wrong with them.

518
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,220
to the people.

519
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,220
Now, I won't leave the city alone.

520
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,540
I'll meet the people in Dingzhou

521
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,140
and face the famine with them.

522
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,340
The villagers will be sent to the village

523
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,820
in two days.

524
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,020
We don't believe it.

525
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,620
We won't give them any money.

526
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,060
We won't give them any money.

527
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:13,780
Come on.

528
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,820
Give us money.

529
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,340
Let's go.

530
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,060
Come on.

531
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,860
Look at them.

532
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,620
They're all angry.

533
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,500
How can they hear what you said?

534
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,180
Come on.

535
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,060
No need to come.

536
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:22,980
Come on.

537
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,060
Open the gate.

538
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,660
Open the gate.

539
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,500
Where's Liu Xuelan?

540
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,420
Open the gate.

541
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:27,900
Open the gate.

542
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,140
Depart.

543
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Everyone,

544
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,800
catch them in the起.

545
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,140
Do not get beaten and killed.

546
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,760
We are too crowded.

547
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,400
We don't want you to be scared.

548
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,260
I don't want you to be scared.

549
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,940
We are not afraid.

550
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,520
We claim to be afraid.

551
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,680
They are in the front.

552
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,580
Let's see if they catch them.

553
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,740
Catch them.

554
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,580
Let's go.

555
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,660
Go.

556
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,860
Go.

557
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,460
Go.

558
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,460
Hurry up!

559
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,460
Kill her!

560
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,460
Kill her!

561
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,460
Hurry up!

562
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
Kill her!

563
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,460
Kill her!

564
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
Kill her!

565
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,460
Catch Jiang Erniang!

566
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,460
Jiang Erniang is a big girl!

567
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
Catch her!

568
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,460
We must have food!

569
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,460
Are you blaming the enemy woman for the crime?

570
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,460
Don't be so serious!

571
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,460
Can't you leave?

572
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,460
Kill us all!

573
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,460
Everyone, hurry up!

574
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,460
Catch Jiang Erniang!

575
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,460
Catch her!

576
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,460
What are you doing?

577
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,460
Catch her!

578
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,460
Catch her!

579
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,460
We must have food!

580
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,460
We must have food!

581
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,460
Catch her!

582
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,460
Go!

583
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,460
Go!

584
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,460
Catch her!

585
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,460
Get her!

586
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,460
I'm not coming!

587
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,460
Food is coming!

588
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
Food is coming!

589
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,460
We must have food!

590
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,460
We must have food!

591
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460
Food is coming!

592
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,460
Ye Shijie!

593
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,460
Food is coming!

594
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,460
Food is coming!

595
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,460
Get off!

596
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,460
Get off!

597
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,300
Get off the car.

598
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,700
The cow is coming.

599
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,940
The cow is coming.

600
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,660
Get up.

601
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,420
Get up.

602
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:06,980
Why are you catching me?

603
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,980
Why are you catching me?

604
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,460
Get up.

605
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:09,780
Get up.

606
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,460
Let me run.

607
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,420
No.

608
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,060
Don't run.

609
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,220
Don't rush.

610
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,020
Get on the team.

611
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,860
Everyone has it.

612
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,900
Don't worry.

613
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,620
We all have it.

614
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,260
Thank you.

615
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:18,780
Thank you.

616
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,700
Let's go to the front.

617
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,340
Li.

618
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:20,900
Thank you.

619
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,780
I'm late.

620
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,380
It's not late, cousin.

621
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,540
Thank you for your help.

622
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,740
Otherwise, it's hard to keep it today.

623
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,940
Don't say that.

624
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,940
This is the love of our Ye family.

625
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,020
You are not ashamed.

626
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,060
Cousin.

627
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,260
I'm going to take the team.

628
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,100
Thank you.

629
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,620
That's enough, Ye.

630
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,540
Such a short time.

631
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,780
Why are there so many food?

632
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,100
If I'm not sure,

633
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,420
I won't leave easily.

634
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,740
Before you come back,

635
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,260
Brother Tang wrote to me.

636
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,140
He said you would pass Dingzhou.

637
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,900
But Dingzhou is in a panic.

638
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,580
I'm afraid some people will take this opportunity

639
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,020
to find you.

640
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,340
So from that time on,

641
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,820
we have prepared it.

642
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,780
Li may be trapped in Dingzhou.

643
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,740
The world has let us think of a way to help him.

644
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,700
Boss.

645
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,980
There was some cash on the account.

646
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,420
But now they have invested in the raw materials and artificial materials.

647
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,180
We need to put Li Zheng Dang out first.

648
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,860
We need to keep the money.

649
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,500
And all my jewelry.

650
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
We need to save them first.

651
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,220
Okay.

652
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,060
Sister Jia.

653
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,460
Do you have to go to Cangzhou to buy food?

654
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,620
The food price there is much more expensive than Lu Yang.

655
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,940
I just asked the standard.

656
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,580
From Lu Yang to Dingzhou,

657
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,060
they set up a house.

658
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,900
The Ye family is in the cold.

659
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,580
They will sell food to the food market.

660
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,940
They will deduct the food.

661
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,620
Even if Lu Yang is in the cold,

662
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,060
they can't get over it.

663
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,460
The other world said,

664
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,820
don't let people know that our Ye family is in the cold.

665
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,940
I will keep the money in Cangzhou.

666
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,620
Yes.

667
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,460
Cousin.

668
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,140
How did you know these things in advance?

669
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,780
I received a secret letter.

670
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,860
You dare to believe it?

671
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,860
What if someone tells you the fake news?

672
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,100
If it's from someone else,

673
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,220
I won't believe it.

674
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,060
But...

675
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,620
The Ye family is in a good mood.

676
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,620
Now they are all in the cold.

677
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,500
They can move from Cangzhou.

678
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,860
It's not a good luck.

679
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,940
It's part of the main army's plan.

680
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,540
I can't believe it.

681
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,420
The secret letter from the State Prefect of State

682
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,020
not only sent to the Ye family,

683
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,580
but also sent to the Jiang family.

684
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,500
The secret letter from the Ye family

685
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,380
is from Cangzhou.

686
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,660
What does it mean?

687
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,860
Li Zhongnan

688
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,060
set up the road to Dingzhou.

689
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,740
The road to Dingzhou is full of roads.

690
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,380
The defense can remove the food from the second wife.

691
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,180
But the only person who can handle Cangzhou is us.

692
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,540
But the Ye family will really abandon the ball.

693
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,780
Will the Gao family go to Cangzhou to take the food?

694
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,180
There is no better way now.

695
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,260
You can believe it or not.

696
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,180
Send the message to Cangzhou.

697
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,940
You must ensure that the Ye family's food

698
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,300
is successfully reached Dingzhou.

699
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,300
But how to solve the secret letter?

700
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,260
How to solve it?

701
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,900
Zhongnan is acting.

702
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,140
He thinks I'm the best

703
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,380
in Jiangyuan.

704
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,420
The main army is playing with the east and west.

705
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,500
We can play the game

706
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,820
in Weixian.

707
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,340
If the other party wants to go to the valley,

708
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,860
if we don't take the risk,

709
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,740
they will suspect that the main army has a hard-to-understand plan.

710
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,220
It's hard to put the food in the Ye family.

711
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,820
Only the Ye family can solve the crisis.

712
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,500
If we are really caught,

713
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,340
we won't be able to get the food.

714
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,380
If the main army takes you there,

715
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,380
we will have to pull a piece of the game.

716
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,900
The money is not given.

717
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,500
If we don't go,

718
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,460
they will surely have a plan.

719
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,700
They won't be able to solve the problem.

720
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,540
Dingzhou's problem will be solved.

721
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,140
They will have to take the blame.

722
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,660
What if the Ye family can't catch up?

723
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,020
The main army will be in trouble.

724
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,780
The main army believes that the Jiangyuan family

725
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,780
will definitely wait for the Ye family.

726
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,220
Did they tell Jiangyuan family

727
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,180
about this plan before the main army?

728
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,980
No.

729
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,260
But they...

730
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,580
They are not afraid of the new.

731
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,700
Xi, you are evil.

732
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,180
It's dark.

733
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,660
Why are you looking for me?

734
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,140
Did you hear that?

735
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,300
The general is taking the people of Huaixiang to the capital to report to the imperial court.

736
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,780
I heard that.

737
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,820
He also took someone back.

738
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,340
Huaixiang is in charge of the county.

739
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,740
He is a person of Huaixiang.

740
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,420
It seems that you already know about this.

741
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,700
So you are not surprised.

742
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,020
I just heard what Xue Zijian said.

743
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:49,820
Then how are you going to deal with him?

744
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,980
You don't ask why Xue Huaiyuan is not dead.

745
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,780
You also don't ask if our gold mine is safe.

746
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,060
You just care about how I will deal with him.

747
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,740
He is already taking back the money.

748
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,780
The people of Dali Temple are waiting for him at the gate of the city.

749
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,700
As long as he enters the city, he will be in danger.

750
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,340
Are you so concerned about him?

751
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,220
Are you afraid that he will suffer?

752
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,980
Do you have to treat me like this?

753
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,540
I just think that every time you talk about him,

754
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,780
you want to talk about Consort Xue.

755
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,540
Am I misunderstanding or is it your misunderstanding?

756
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,060
Consort Xue is the one who is going to take the throne.

757
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,460
You are the one who is going to take the throne.

758
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,460
I killed Consort Xue.

759
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,860
You killed Consort Xue.

760
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,260
Now Consort Xue is buried in the earth and will never be able to return to the city.

761
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,940
But Consort Xue is going back to the capital.

762
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,780
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

763
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,940
What did you say?

764
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,140
Once Huai Xiang's case is over,

765
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,660
His Highness and the King of the City will be in a terrible state.

766
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,860
At this time, His Highness will not die.

767
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,060
He will be like me, a dead man.

768
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,260
How dare you scold me?

769
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,660
I know my mistake.

770
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,660
I was too hasty and offended His Highness.

771
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,660
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

772
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,460
Don't think that I can do anything to you

773
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,060
just because I am happy to see you.

774
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,460
My fault.

775
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,260
I can't even turn you down.

776
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,860
Yes.

777
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,260
This Jiang Li will have to come back soon.

778
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,260
I can't wait to see you return.

779
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,260
I can't wait to see you again.

780
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Look at the book written by the Grand Priest.

781
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,660
What does it mean to write in the same way as Li Zhongnan?

782
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,860
It's about the same.

783
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,460
But it's more detailed.

784
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,460
It's about the law of many cases.

785
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,460
I have to punish the crime of this Jiang family.

786
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,460
Li Zhongnan will be even more cruel.

787
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,460
To take this case,

788
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,460
is it only Jiang Yuanbai's fault?

789
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,460
What do you think?

790
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,460
It's a bit difficult.

791
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,460
You think it's difficult, too?

792
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,460
Li Zhongnan's book is very well-written.

793
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,460
After all, Jiang Li and Xue Huaiyuan just returned to the capital.

794
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,460
The charges have not been settled.

795
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,460
The negotiation is too far away.

796
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,460
The book written by the Grand Priest

797
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,460
can't be kept anymore.

798
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,460
I have to criticize it today.

799
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,460
Then criticize it.

800
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,460
So calm.

801
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,460
If you knew that

802
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,460
your son would be in danger.

803
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,460
What do you think of it?

804
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,460
It's a good thing to say.

805
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,460
I will obey your words.

806
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,460
Zhu Xun.

807
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,460
Zhu Xun.

808
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,460
We've been watching the play for several times.

809
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,460
What's wrong with Chu Qing?

810
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,460
Don't talk to him if you don't want to.

811
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,460
Jiang Jia's daughter Jiang Li

812
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,460
saved the world in Huai Xiang.

813
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
The evidence is confirmed.

814
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,460
She is in the back of the Dali Temple.

815
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,460
Miss Jiang Er,

816
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,460
I'm taking you and Xue Huaiyuan to the hospital today.

817
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,460
Are you scared?

818
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,460
Sir,

819
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,460
I've never thought of going to the Dali Temple.

820
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,460
Guards, take her away.

821
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,460
Everyone,

822
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,460
listen to me.

823
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,460
I did collect the ball.

824
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,460
The law should be in the prison.

825
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,460
But I, Jiang Li, don't regret it.

826
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,460
I brought you all to the capital.

827
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,460
Not to make you all suffer for me,

828
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,460
but to hope that your abyss

829
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,460
can reach the heavens.

830
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,460
Our emperor is a wise man.

831
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,460
Xue Xianlin's abyss,

832
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,460
your abyss,

833
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,460
will definitely be the world.

834
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,460
Sir,

835
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,460
I only have one request.

836
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
Tell me.

837
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,460
I want to knock on the door

838
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,460
of the Dengwen Valley in the capital.

839
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
I'll go.

840
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,460
It's been a long time

841
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,460
since no one has knocked on the Dengwen Valley.

842
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,460
What did you say?

843
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,460
The time General Xiao died.

844
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,460
Chang'an Gate.

845
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,460
Denggou Tai.

846
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,460
Dengwen Valley.

847
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,460
Xue Huaiyuan, the county magistrate of Huaixiang.

848
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,460
I've been a courtier

849
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,460
and I've been a good person.

850
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,460
I've been a good person.

851
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,460
But I've been a traitor.

852
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,460
You've been a criminal.

853
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,460
You've been a traitor.

854
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,460
I'm a woman.

855
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,460
But I can't bear to see

856
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,460
the loyal official Meng Yuan

857
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,460
die for good.

858
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,460
Today,

859
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,460
the Dengwen Valley

860
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,460
will be in the abyss for Xue Huaiyuan.

861
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,460
The Dengwen Valley.

862
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,460
The Dengwen Valley.

863
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,460
Qin Qingfeng.

864
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,460
Song Gu Sheng.

865
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,460
Please enter the palace.

866
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,460
The palace is in the abyss.

867
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,460
The palace is in the abyss.

868
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,460
If there is no happy memory.

869
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,460
How can I pass through the deep mountains

870
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,460
and the deep mountains?

871
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,460
Dad.

872
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,460
Dad.

873
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,460
Stop.

874
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,460
Dad.

875
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,460
Tell me.

876
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,460
You come down.

877
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,460
What are you doing?

878
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,460
My dad is a bastard.

879
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,460
I'm going to kill him.

880
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,460
I'm going to give my dad a birth.

881
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,460
Dad.

882
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,460
Your dad is a bastard.

883
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,460
He is the reason why I'm acting.

884
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
Chen Yuanren.

885
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,460
Chen Yuanren.

886
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,460
Let me go.

887
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,460
Let me go.

888
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,460
Let me go.

889
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,460
Let me go.

890
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,460
Dad.

891
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,460
I'm sorry.

892
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,460
I can only serve Xue Xianlin.

893
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,460
I miss the Dengwen Valley.

894
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,460
Let's go.

895
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,460
Wait.

896
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,460
Jia.

897
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,460
Don't be so angry.

898
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,460
We are here.

899
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,460
I'm not angry.

900
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,460
Just tell her.

901
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,460
I will serve Xue Xianlin.

902
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,460
Please send me a child.

903
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,460
Please send me a child.

904
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,460
Please enter the palace.

Sorry.

947
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,740
Your majesty

948
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,740
What's going on outside?

949
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,740
The lanterns outside Chang'an

950
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,740
Who's the heir?

951
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,740
It's the second wife

952
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,740
The third wife of the second wife

953
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,740
She's got many people to look after her

954
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,740
The fourth wife of the eldest wife has taken her

955
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,740
The people who are now the heir of the second wife

956
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,740
Please forgive me

957
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,740
I'm wrong

958
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,740
My niece is not sincere

959
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,740
It has nothing to do with the concubine

960
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,740
She's a good girl

961
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,740
I'll go and see

962
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,740
You're here quite quickly

963
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,740
Tell me

964
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,740
What's going on in Chang'an?

965
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,740
Your majesty

966
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,740
The chancellor ordered the brand to come in

967
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,740
I'm begging you

968
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,740
What do you think?

969
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,740
It's not good to see you

970
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,740
Tell me I'm not free

971
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,740
Please go back

972
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,740
Yes

973
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,740
I'm afraid I can't keep my heart safe

974
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,740
Tell me

975
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,740
The lanterns outside Chang'an are small

976
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,740
The chancellor also caught them

977
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,740
What should I do next?

978
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,740
To make you a wife and a son?

979
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,740
It's not true

980
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,740
He has already left his own path

981
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,740
The case of the end of the world, Xue Huaiyuan

982
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,740
The case of the illness, the case of the heir

983
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,740
Xue Huaiyuan is not a criminal

984
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,740
The case of the end of the world is not sincere

985
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,740
I'm sorry

986
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,740
I'm sorry

987
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,740
What's wrong?

988
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,740
I think it's interesting

989
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,740
Where are you

990
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,740
To pick up this chess

991
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,740
It's not that I picked it up

992
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,740
It was he who sent it to me

993
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,740
Yes, he's a good chess player

994
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,740
I heard the lanterns outside Chang'an today

995
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,740
Are you embarrassed?

996
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,740
Your majesty, aren't you embarrassed?

997
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,740
Embarrassed?

998
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,740
After all, I've been waiting for this day for a long time

999
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,740
It's just that we've been together

1000
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,740
We've been together for a long time

1001
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,740
I've been watching you for a long time

1002
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,740
Pass the order

1003
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,740
In the cold wind

1004
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,740
In the long night

1005
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,740
With the warmth of the treasure

1006
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,740
The body is still alive

1007
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,740
Not strong

1008
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:46,740
Can you sell the stars yesterday?

1009
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,740
Love is a game

1010
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,740
With life to prove

1011
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,740
Live on

1012
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,740
Even if it's a little sad

1013
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,740
No matter if it's a bad luck or a bad luck

1014
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,740
I believe in you

1015
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:16,740
I'd rather be trapped in the cold of the world

1016
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:24,740
Live on, hold all the courage

1017
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:31,740
Love continues until you breathe

1018
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:36,740
Pass the order

1019
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,740
Only for you

1020
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:46,740
After the light is gone, it's not far away

1021
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:55,740
After the light is gone, it's not far away
