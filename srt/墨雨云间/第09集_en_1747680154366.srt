1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm blinded by the thousands of roads

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon knows all my attempts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's just a page of a book written in your heart

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A fox in my heart

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Accept all the gifts of love

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of regrets

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't want to lose

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Slowly resist the suffering of the world

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Walking through the winter, I still miss the old days

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Waiting for the spring to return again

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A bet?

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes, he not only said that whoever lost will apologize

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He also said that if he lost, he would go back to Zhengyutang

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't know if the pig gave me such a brain

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I was so scared before

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I thought he would be Xue Fangfei's revenge

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now I'm relieved

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Except for the appearance of this brain

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The rest are not like

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's just too arrogant

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Dare to make a bet with the Li family's son

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He doesn't know their strength?

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't say it anymore, I don't want to hear this

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Brother, what's wrong with you recently?

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Always unhappy

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Nothing

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There are many things in the dark

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Brother is a little tired

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You go back to the house first

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you worried about Jiang Li?

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Fan Ruoyun

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't be so impudent

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm talking to you

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You want me to ask you

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you want to move back to your own house?

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't want to live here

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
After all, I live in the study all day

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It doesn't look like a good place

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I live here very well

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Brother, you lock your room

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't let people in and clean it

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's not good to go down like this

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Or you give me your key

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I and my mother go to the house

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Throw away his things

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So you can go back to live

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Go out

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Go out

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Go out

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Go out

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Go out

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Go out

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The wind is getting stronger recently

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Wait a minute

56
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:45,120
Wait for me to give you a

57
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Mr. Ji Mo

58
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You

59
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Put your clothes on and talk to me

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Mr. Shu

61
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Did I do something wrong?

62
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I heard people asking me like this

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I have heard

64
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Do you have no money to pay the iron silk?

65
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You can't even count women

66
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What did you say

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't know

68
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Straight talk

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Pour wine

70
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This one

71
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You are her person

72
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What

73
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What are you doing

74
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Don't come over

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You...

76
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,160
Where did you take the

77
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,080
Lian Tie Si's

78
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
Kui Kong?

79
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
I don't know.

80
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
Although I'm his uncle,

81
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
I don't know anything.

82
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
Why did you say so much?

83
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
Aren't we

84
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,080
new guys today?

85
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
What is this?

86
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Good question.

87
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
This

88
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
is what makes you

89
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
a eunuch.

90
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
But

91
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
for a real eunuch

92
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,080
it's a hard way.

93
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
For you

94
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
I might need

95
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
more time.

96
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
What do you want?

97
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Drink wine

98
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,160
and learn how to marry a woman.

99
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
You're lonely.

100
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
You'll be lonely

101
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
and feel lonely in the future.

102
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
I'm not married yet.

103
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
I have no children.

104
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,160
I'll tell you.

105
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
The first year I came

106
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
my brother-in-law didn't let me meet him.

107
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Then he thought I was honest.

108
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
He took me

109
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
to do some

110
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,240
money-making.

111
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
After I got the money

112
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
I was sent to the prison.

113
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
To whom?

114
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,240
I don't know.

115
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
No, no, no.

116
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
I really don't know.

117
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Sister,

118
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
it's all Kong's doing.

119
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
If I tell you,

120
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Kong's going to be fired.

121
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
He won't tell me.

122
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Give him a piece of paper.

123
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Write down

124
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,240
the days when you went to the prison.

125
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
I wrote it wrong.

127
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,320
I'll make you die of hunger.

128
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
I'll write it.

129
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Thank you.

130
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
I don't want money.

131
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
It's convenient for you

132
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
to take the money.

133
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Besides, you deserve it.

134
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
I haven't paid off

135
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Duke Su's debt yet.

136
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
If it wasn't for Sister Yu

137
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
I might have died long ago.

138
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
I'm your eyes.

139
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
I just hope that one day

140
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
I can find General Xiao

141
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
and Sister Yu's real cause.

142
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
My father died in the battlefield.

143
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
My mother died of illness.

144
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
It was already settled eight years ago.

145
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
What's left to investigate?

146
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Do you believe what others believe?

147
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
The more you know,

148
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
the faster you die.

149
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
I don't believe it.

150
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,400
You're so ruthless.

151
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Father.

152
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
I want to go with you.

153
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Xiao Hong.

154
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
We're going to fight.

155
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
We're not going to train.

156
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Then you're in danger.

157
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Don't worry.

158
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
I'll bring the dragon and the tiger army.

159
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
You're not going to die.

160
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I'll take care of the rest.

161
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
I'll go with you.

162
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
You can go.

163
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
I'll go with you.

164
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
I'll go with you.

165
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
I'll go with you.

166
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
I'll go with you.

167
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I'll go with you.

168
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
I'll go with you.

169
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
You can't go.

170
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
Wait for me.

171
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Mother.

172
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
Heng, it's time to sleep.

173
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
I won't go.

174
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
I want to be with father.

175
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Be good.

176
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Go back and sleep.

177
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Mother, I beg you.

178
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Let me go with you.

179
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
When mother comes back,

180
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
sing a song for you.

181
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
I won't go.

182
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Hengguo.

183
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
General.

184
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Send Heng to the Mansion of Duke Guo tomorrow.

185
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Give it to General Xiao.

186
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Yes.

187
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Heng, go.

188
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
I won't go.

189
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Let me go.

190
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Father.

191
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Father.

192
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Father.

193
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Father.

194
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Father.

195
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Father.

196
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Father.

197
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Father.

198
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
Father.

199
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Wake up.

200
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Take her away.

201
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
Father.

202
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
Let me go.

203
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
Let me go.

204
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
Heng, wake up.

205
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Stop it.

206
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
Uncle.

207
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
My father

208
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
will never lose to them.

209
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
There must be a trick in this song.

210
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
We must find out.

211
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
The soul dies in the sword,

212
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
the soul dies in the battle.

213
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,640
The battle will last forever.

214
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
The battle

215
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
is the family's custom.

216
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
Father died in a terrible way.

217
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
Grandfather,

218
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,720
do you really think it's a sword?

219
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
The Holy School is a common thing in the military.

220
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I don't understand.

221
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,720
I don't understand why you are so ruthless.

222
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
No wonder father always said

223
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
you were not satisfied with him since you were a child.

224
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
Now even if he died,

225
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
you wouldn't be willing to defend him.

226
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Ye Langxin.

227
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
I hate you.

228
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
I hate you.

229
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Hurry up.

230
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Hurry up.

231
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Hurry up.

232
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Hurry up.

233
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
It's really a sword.

234
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
The sky is cold.

235
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Look at this.

236
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Look at this.

237
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
Look at this.

238
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Look at this.

239
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
It's so beautiful.

240
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
It's so beautiful.

241
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
The sword is so sharp.

242
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
It's so beautiful.

243
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
It's so beautiful.

244
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Mother.

245
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Mother.

246
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Madam.

247
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Mother.

248
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Mother, what's wrong with you?

249
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Madam.

250
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Mother.

251
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Mother, are you okay?

252
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Qing.

253
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Mother.

254
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Madam.

255
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Uncle.

256
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Is it beautiful?

257
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Yes.

258
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Heng'er.

259
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
This hairpin

260
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
is from your father.

261
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
It's the most precious thing I have.

262
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Here.

263
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Put it on for me.

264
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Mother.

265
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
You look so beautiful.

266
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Mother.

267
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Father died in a very bad way.

268
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
They didn't listen to me.

269
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Heng'er was still young.

270
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
After you grow up,

271
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
you will understand

272
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
many things.

273
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Your father

274
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
is a man

275
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
who is always on top.

276
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
He always respects you.

277
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
So in the future,

278
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Heng'er can't always cry.

279
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Otherwise, your father and I

280
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
will be heartbroken.

281
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
I just hope

282
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
you can grow up safely

283
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
and happily.

284
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Can you do it?

285
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Heng'er.

286
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Heng'er.

287
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
Heng'er.

288
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Heng'er.

289
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Heng'er.

290
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Heng'er.

291
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Heng'er.

292
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Heng'er.

293
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
Heng'er.

294
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Heng'er.

295
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Heng'er.

296
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Heng'er.

297
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Heng'er.

298
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Heng'er.

299
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Heng'er.

300
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Heng'er.

301
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Heng'er.

302
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Heng'er.

303
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Heng'er.

304
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Heng'er.

305
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Heng'er.

306
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Heng'er.

307
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Heng'er.

308
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,760
Heng'er.

309
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,480
Master is not in the mood today.

310
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Then I'll tell you something interesting.

311
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,560
This second lady Jiang and Li Lian are in a bet.

312
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
Jiang Li lost, she wants to go back to Zhennv Hall.

313
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,560
Li Lian lost, she wants to go out.

314
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,640
I was also surprised when I first heard it.

315
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,120
I didn't expect this second lady Jiang

316
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,520
to be really angry with you.

317
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,000
Do you think this Jiang Li

318
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,760
is a stubborn person

319
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,880
or is she ungrateful?

320
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,080
Is she a wild tiger

321
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,120
or a fierce tiger?

322
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,400
We'll know in a moment.

323
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,480
Sister, are you feeling uncomfortable?

324
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
What's wrong?

325
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,040
Why are you crying?

326
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,320
Sister, I heard that

327
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,920
you and that Li Brother were in a bet.

328
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,520
My heart is beating fast.

329
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,320
I only hate myself.

330
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,360
I can't do anything for you.

331
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,440
It's okay, Tong'er.

332
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,680
I'm a little bit sure.

333
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,920
Sister, are you really not afraid?

334
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,760
If you want to give up,

335
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,560
you can't think of anything.

336
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,560
I must see the God and be hurt.

337
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,480
Sister, are you going to tell the God

338
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,600
about the injustice you and my wife have done?

339
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,160
It's not the time yet.

340
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,640
It's thanks to Jiang Erniangzi

341
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,120
that she really returned to the capital.

342
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,560
Everyone in the city saw me.

343
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,880
No one else dared to do anything to me.

344
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,920
And I want to know

345
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,280
who is behind Shen Yu Rong.

346
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,920
Sister, you mean

347
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,000
someone is behind her?

348
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,680
Li, I have no choice.

349
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,800
She wants to stick me to death

350
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,400
like a ant.

351
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,840
There must be.

352
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,600
And this person

353
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,840
has the wealth of the world

354
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,920
to help Shen Yu Rong

355
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,880
to rise up step by step.

356
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,600
I don't know who this person is.

357
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,080
I don't know why this person

358
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,840
will keep an eye on me and my family.

359
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,040
But instead of my hard work to explore,

360
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,080
I'd rather use myself as a bait

361
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,600
to lure her out.

362
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,520
The inner palace banquet

363
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,280
is a good platform.

364
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,520
I stand on it.

365
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,520
That person has to look at me.

366
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,800
What does it say here?

367
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,120
Your Highness, you've pressed my sleeve.

368
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,440
If you need something,

369
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,120
just write it for me.

370
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Keep your mouth shut.

371
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,480
Don't take my sacrificed jacket as a gift.

372
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,720
But you can write it as my love.

373
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,680
What are you writing?

374
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,000
My heart,

375
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,520
for theHeyday,

376
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
I must be careful.

377
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,120
You're talking nonsense again.

378
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,720
Yes.

379
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,320
I know my mistake.

380
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Please go ahead.

381
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,120
Have you heard

382
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,920
about the bet between Li's second son and Jiang's second wife?

383
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
I didn't care about that.

384
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,720
Jiang's second wife is the woman who killed her mother, right?

385
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,720
How is it?

386
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
Is she pretty?

387
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,520
This one is the best.

388
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,220
What woman?

389
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,820
You know.

390
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,920
What woman is it?

391
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,020
Jiang.

392
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,620
Jiang.

393
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
Didn't I tell you to help her?

394
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,320
Long time ago,

395
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,720
i bought her an expensive life shop

396
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,320
That I keyed her with my own money.

397
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,520
The second wife killed her mother.

398
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,000
Do you think

399
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
such a woman

400
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,040
can win the bet with the second son of Li family?

401
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,040
Of course, it's the son of Li family.

402
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,520
Liar.

403
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,360
You wrote it wrong.

404
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,760
Let me write another chapter for you.

405
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,120
No need.

406
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,040
Your heart is in a mess.

407
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,520
What else can you write?

408
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,360
One more chapter.

409
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
I'm sure you can write it well.

410
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,520
I said forget it.

411
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,080
Didn't you hear it clearly, Shen Yurou?

412
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
I'm not in the mood

413
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,120
to be with you anymore.

414
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,360
A man who doesn't even know how to lie.

415
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,480
How can he make me happy?

416
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,680
Chen Wunao.

417
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,360
You apologized to me.

418
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,560
I'm not angry anymore.

419
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,960
I'm not angry.

420
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,760
Don't pretend to be wronged in front of me.

421
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,080
Go out and bet.

422
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,720
Buy me a ginger drink.

423
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,400
In 10 years,

424
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
I'll live within this mansion

425
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Kasana loss

426
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,320
is bribing the men.

427
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,840
The marriage declaration is over.

428
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,320
It's ridiculous.

429
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,200
You are really not obedient anymore.

430
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
I understand everything

431
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,360
If it wasn't for the old lady's persistence

432
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
she wouldn't have stayed for another year

433
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
She has already been admitted to the Hall of Fame

434
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
There are still many troubles in the future

435
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
I have lost my respect

436
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,360
I really didn't expect that

437
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Husband, forget it

438
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
Don't be too harsh on Li'er

439
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Young and vigorous

440
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,360
These are inevitable

441
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
Let her admit her mistakes

442
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
We will come back and teach her slowly

443
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,360
If she can admit her mistakes

444
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
she won't be sent to the real daughter

445
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
I want to see

446
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,360
whether she has been

447
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
repented in the past ten years

448
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
Husband

449
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,360
Husband

450
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
Husband

451
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Calm down

452
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Here she comes

453
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
Wife

454
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Wife

455
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,360
You don't have to help me

456
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
Husband, the wife has been kneeling for a day and a night

457
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
Please persuade her

458
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Father

459
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
What are you doing?

460
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
I did something wrong

461
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
I should be punished

462
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
You know it's wrong

463
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Why are you still doing it?

464
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Because as the daughter of the chancellor

465
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
I am not a good daughter

466
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,360
I shouldn't be ashamed of you

467
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
I don't have the face to be ashamed

468
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,360
But you have your own face

469
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
You are a bet with others

470
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,360
and you are against the Li family

471
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
If you lose

472
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,360
you are a joke

473
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Father

474
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
I wanted to focus on the study

475
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,360
But the master of Mingyi Hall changed the examination system

476
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
If it is not a good test

477
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
I don't even have the qualification to take the exam

478
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
I just entered the hall

479
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
I don't have friends

480
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,360
The sisters have their own ideas

481
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
I finally found the right person

482
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
But the Li brothers

483
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,360
They want to take advantage of me

484
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,360
They are so cruel

485
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,360
They are so rude

486
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,360
They said

487
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
They said

488
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
What?

489
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
They said I can't stay in Mingyi Hall

490
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
They want me to kneel and admit my mistake

491
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
You are so mean

492
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
You don't have to mind it

493
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,360
I will help you

494
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Father

495
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,360
The Prime Minister Li can't do anything for you

496
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
So I am here to provoke you

497
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,360
If I quit

498
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,360
what will happen to you?

499
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
Don't think about it

500
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,360
I will talk to Li Zhongnan tomorrow

501
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
and cancel the bet

502
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Dongyue has spread in the capital

503
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,360
If father can help me

504
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
I will be criticized

505
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I don't want to be humiliated in front of the Prime Minister

506
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,360
Father

507
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
I have grown up

508
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
You have protected me for many years

509
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Now

510
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
I will make a bet

511
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,360
I will make the bet

512
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
I will bet on my future life

513
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,360
I will bet on my dignity as the daughter of the Jiang family

514
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Father

515
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
Please help me

516
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
Please

517
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Sister

518
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
This zither is for you

519
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Since father spoke

520
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
I will help you

521
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
If you need any help

522
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Tell me

523
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
The zither you used

524
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,680
You can help me win the game

525
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,520
This music score is for you

526
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,360
But I don't know how to play the zither

527
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,880
I can't help you

528
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,840
I'm very grateful

529
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,280
to have your help

530
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,840
We don't have much time

531
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,040
Sister

532
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,960
We should get ready as soon as possible

533
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,840
Madam

534
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,360
We sent you good things

535
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,080
You're just helping him?

536
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,880
Yes

537
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,480
Why not?

538
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,360
He wants to fly high

539
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,280
We can make him

540
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,640
fly high

541
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,760
Huang Shulan defeated you

542
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,200
He thought Uncle would scold you

543
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,560
He supported you until the end

544
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,440
Who doesn't have a breath of air?

545
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,400
Father is also a man

546
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,240
I'm really curious

547
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,960
What are you good at?

548
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,560
You can play the zither?

549
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,520
Zhen Nvtang has learned it

550
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,440
Your sister can't even buy the jewelry

551
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,040
You even play the zither for her

552
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,280
I will give her

553
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,720
the jewelry in the future

554
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,880
Mother, don't worry

555
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,480
But if the zither is not repaired for many days

556
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
The hand will be broken

557
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,800
I'm afraid it will be hard to get it back

558
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,200
If I knew

559
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,040
You don't have me and your sister

560
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,400
We would have

561
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,040
been hit by the wall together

562
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,000
Mother, what are you doing?

563
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,360
Why don't you make sense?

564
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,840
Don't touch me

565
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,560
Be careful

566
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,480
Wife

567
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,160
What happened?

568
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Huh?

569
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Honey.

570
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
You're injured?

571
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
I'll call the doctor.

572
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
No need.

573
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
I'll go see the doctor myself.

574
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
No.

575
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
I'll go with you.

576
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Honey.

577
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
Wu Ai.

578
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Let's go.

579
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
The nail is just a little bit cracked.

580
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
It's not that serious.

581
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,160
It's very serious.

582
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
Say it properly.

583
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
You're a country's daughter.

584
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
If you can't cure it, I'll take you to the doctor.

585
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,160
But there's an old wound on her wrist.

586
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Old wound?

587
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
Yes.

588
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
The old wound is not well treated.

589
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Now it's a little bit of a trouble.

590
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,160
But don't worry too much.

591
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,160
These days, you should drink every day.

592
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,160
At the same time, take the medicine I prescribed.

593
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Don't work too hard.

594
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,160
In the next ten days, playing the zither and riding the horse will be fine.

595
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Doctor.

596
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
How long will it take to recover?

597
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
At least a month.

598
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Can't it be faster?

599
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
This is a disease.

600
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
It's not a child's play.

601
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
It needs to be continued.

602
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Thank you, doctor.

603
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Please go and take the medicine.

604
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
Okay.

605
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Why is there an old wound?

606
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Working day and night in Zhen Nv Hall.

607
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
What's wrong with getting hurt?

608
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
I mean,

609
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
You know you have a wound on your wrist.

610
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
What are you fighting with Li's brothers?

611
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
I caught a weak head.

612
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
I'm afraid I can't get it.

613
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
I'm afraid I can't get it.

614
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
I'm afraid I can't get it.

615
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
I'm afraid I can't get it.

616
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
I'm afraid I can't get it.

617
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
I caught a weak head.

618
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
So,

619
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Do you still have a case of fire?

620
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
No.

621
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
No.

622
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,160
I'm serious.

623
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
I'm serious.

624
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
My father was a great national player.

625
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
Later,

626
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,160
When he became an official,

627
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,160
My mother thought playing chess

628
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
would affect her career.

629
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,160
So she didn't let my father play.

630
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
But when I was a kid,

631
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,160
I learned a lot from my father.

632
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,160
I can handle it all.

633
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Then go back and play chess.

634
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,160
You can play chess?

635
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,160
Why do you teach everything in Zhen Nv Hall?

636
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
I want to go there.

637
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Sir,

638
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Can you please help me see if the medicine is ready?

639
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,160
My wife has to take medicine.

640
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Yes, yes, yes.

641
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Take the medicine.

642
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
Is it ready?

643
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
Sister,

644
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
How do you play the zither?

645
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
There must be a way to the mountain.

646
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
We just have to take care of the others.

647
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Yes.

648
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Your son is

649
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
having a fever.

650
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
He seems to be ill.

651
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
The mountain is so beautiful.

652
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
I want to go there.

653
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
I want to see the mountain.

654
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
I want to see the mountain.

655
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
I want to see the mountain.

656
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,160
I want to see the mountain.

657
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
I want to see the mountain.

658
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,160
I want to see the mountain.

659
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
I want to see the mountain.

660
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,160
I want to see the mountain.

661
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,160
I want to see the mountain.

662
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
I want to see the mountain.

663
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
I want to see the mountain.

664
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
I want to see the mountain.

665
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
I want to see the mountain.

666
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
I want to see the mountain.

667
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
I want to see the mountain.

668
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
I want to see the mountain.

669
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
I want to see the mountain.

670
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,160
I want to see the mountain.

671
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
I want to see the mountain.

672
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
I want to see the mountain.

673
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
I want to see the mountain.

674
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
I want to see the mountain.

675
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Show yourself.

676
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
So what?

677
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Show yourself.

678
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Xun.

679
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
You made a good turn today.

680
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,160
I'm cheese behind your back.

681
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Go.

682
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,160
The sun is coming out from the west.

683
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,760
You're really unwise.

684
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,360
This...

685
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
Jiang Li,

686
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,160
What's wrong?

687
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,360
You...

688
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
How did you have the courage to compete to be the top?

689
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Because I'm ungrateful.

690
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,560
Ungrateful to be trapped in Zhen's Hall,

691
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,560
and ungrateful to be stung by Mingyi Hall.

692
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,560
Ungrateful to be hidden in the specifications

693
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
to marry a good husband.

694
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
I want to compete,

695
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,920
I just want to fight for a reason

696
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,120
I want to fight for a reason

697
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,440
to get rid of this place

698
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,560
There's nothing to hide

699
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
I know

700
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,760
why you convinced Yan Shijie

701
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,080
You have a strong will

702
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,080
Only you can convince

703
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,600
such a proud person to join us

704
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,920
I said I wanted to win Li Lian

705
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,560
My cousin is also worthy of the lightening award

706
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,520
This time, whether it's for me

707
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,120
or for him

708
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,360
and us

709
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,720
I will fight for it

710
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,840
I will also do my best

711
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,000
OK

712
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,840
What's wrong?

713
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,360
I fell off the horse before

714
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,680
I didn't want to ride it anymore

715
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,880
Now, I also want to try it again

716
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,640
Liu Xun

717
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,360
Don't worry, I will keep you company

718
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,120
Let's get used to

719
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,840
riding the horse racing

720
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,000
first

721
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,960
I'm fine. Don't worry. Take it easy.

722
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Your thumb is loose.

723
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,960
Don't you know that?

724
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Duke Su.

725
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
You followed me?

726
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
In the eyes of Lady Jiang,

727
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
I'm such a boring person.

728
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
This place is usually a hunting place.

729
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,960
But you guys broke in and it's very dangerous.

730
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,960
We really can't find another place.

731
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Duke Su,

732
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
what did you say about Liu Xu?

733
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
What loose?

734
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
He's a man of his word.

735
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Liu Xu what?

736
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
What loose?

737
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,960
This friend of yours is afraid of the old wounds on the thumb.

738
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
So he brought a loose ring.

739
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,960
I don't know.

740
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,960
The ring doesn't stick to the skin.

741
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
When shooting arrows,

742
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
the ring and the arrow are rubbed against each other.

743
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,960
It's hard to turn.

744
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
The direction before the bow is biased.

745
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Ten miles away,

746
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
it's a thousand miles away.

747
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,960
How can you shoot accurately?

748
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
You're really good.

749
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
Can you shoot arrows?

750
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,960
No.

751
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Bow and arrow are light weapons.

752
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
It's good for women to learn to defend themselves.

753
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Xia Meng, stand here.

754
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Help me hold it.

755
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
I didn't say I wanted to learn.

756
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
I said you sit.

757
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
I'm not going to sit.

758
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
I'm going to sit.

759
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
I'm going to sit.

760
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
I'm going to sit.

761
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
Sit.

762
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
One hand in the middle of the bow.

763
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Be sure to hold tight.

764
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
Can't have a single loose.

765
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,960
Thumb.

766
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
Pull the string.

767
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
That's it.

768
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Remember the position of your thumb.

769
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
I'll take you to pull the bow.

770
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Hold the bow tight.

771
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,960
Otherwise, you're waiting for your opponent to kill you.

772
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Keep an eye on the bow.

773
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
I counted to three.

774
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,960
Follow me.

775
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Let go of your fingers.

776
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Remember.

777
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
Don't hesitate.

778
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
One.

779
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Two.

780
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
Three.

781
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,960
I really hit it.

782
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,960
Try it yourself.

783
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,960
What's wrong with your hand?

784
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Nothing.

785
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,960
You're still fine after getting hurt like this.

786
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
How do you take the class?

787
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
I'm already in the hospital.

788
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
Don't worry, Duke Su.

789
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
The doctor said he wanted to cure it for at least a month.

790
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
Can you wait?

791
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
You still said you didn't monitor me.

792
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
I just passed by.

793
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
Jiang Li, what's wrong?

794
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
If you want to cure it completely,

795
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
come to my mansion today.

796
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
What's wrong with your hand?

797
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
Don't worry.

798
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
It's nothing serious.

799
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,960
I was just saying, why did Duke Su suddenly come to point me out?

800
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,960
Because I'm worried about you.

801
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
He pointed me out.

802
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
So you know each other.

803
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,960
I just heard him ask you to go to his mansion.

804
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Are you really going?

805
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,960
You're going to enter the palace in three days, right?

806
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Yes.

807
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Duke Su is a strange person.

808
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Although he helped us today,

809
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,960
I don't know what he's thinking.

810
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
You'd better not bother him.

811
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
I got it.

812
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,960
Sister, why don't you rest first?

813
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Your hand is injured.

814
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
It's too late.

815
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Isn't there still the Liu family?

816
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
See if they can play the zither.

817
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
Change with me.

818
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Please tell the doctor

819
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Duke Su asked me to come.

820
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
I'm sorry.

821
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
I'm sorry.

822
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,960
I'm sorry.

823
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
I'm sorry.

824
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Duke Su asked me to come.

825
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
Our master asked you to come yesterday.

826
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
He waited for a day.

827
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
He doesn't want to see the guest today.

828
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
I'm late.

829
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
I made Duke Su wait for a long time.

830
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Today, I'll wait for Duke Su.

831
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
Close the door.

832
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,960
There'll be noズ

833
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
Ma'am,

834
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,360
Come with me.

835
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,680
Wait.

836
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,680
What's wrong?

837
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,200
I've been sitting for too long. My legs are numb.

838
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,800
I can't get up.

839
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,600
Your Highness.

840
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,120
You're so elegant.

841
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,880
I'm not here

842
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,680
to eat barbecue.

843
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,680
Since you're not hungry,

844
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,520
wait here.

845
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,280
The doctor hasn't finished his meal.

846
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Please introduce

847
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,440
the best doctor in the world.

848
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,680
Not the best doctor,

849
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,400
but the best gambler.

850
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,520
Xiao Hong.

851
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,600
You brought someone here to teach me how to be a doctor.

852
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,680
What's going on?

853
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,280
Are you going to break my rules?

854
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,560
I won't break your rules.

855
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,120
I'll finish it for him.

856
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,720
You'll take him?

857
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,560
Who is he to you?

858
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,840
What rules?

859
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,120
Xiao Hong hasn't told you yet, right?

860
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,280
If you want me to treat you,

861
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,440
you need to bet with me first.

862
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,080
If you're willing to bet with me,

863
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
I'll bet with you.

864
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,520
Okay.

865
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,000
That's good.

866
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,440
The poisonous spider I just collected

867
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,640
needs someone to test it.

868
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,120
If you win,

869
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,720
I can help you cure your hand.

870
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,920
What if I lose?

871
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,400
Give me your life.

872
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,800
How to bet?

873
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,400
These two spiders,

874
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,960
one is poisonous,

875
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,040
the other is not.

876
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,720
Two to one.

877
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,080
Sometimes,

878
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,240
you need to be lucky to be alive.

879
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,640
Otherwise, even if I save you this time,

880
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,680
you won't live long.

881
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,520
Let me remind you.

882
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,560
There's a poisonous spider in here.

883
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,880
If you choose the wrong one,

884
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,480
and get bitten by it,

885
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,520
you'll be in a state of dizziness.

886
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,400
Shall we start?

887
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,320
Wait.

888
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,400
Okay.

889
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,640
You said

890
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,360
you want me to bet my life.

891
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,040
But you didn't say

892
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,880
you want me to bet my own life.

893
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,520
This is the life I want to bet.

894
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,840
Let me introduce you to a doctor.

895
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,880
You're a kind and generous person.

896
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,640
If you have a short life,

897
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,280
I'll bet my life.

898
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,640
To be kind?

899
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,480
Xiang Heng,

900
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,000
I'm warning you.

901
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,760
I'm a real poisonous spider.

902
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,760
Still not start?

903
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,400
Let me choose

904
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,680
which one is poisonous.

905
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,280
This one.

906
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,480
This one.

907
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,200
Start.

908
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,480
Start.

909
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,960
It's not poisonous.

910
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,040
Xiang Heng.

911
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,920
I'll choose this one.

912
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,400
Start.

913
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,200
You win.

914
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,800
This one is not poisonous.

915
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,800
It seems that my hand gave you good luck.

916
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,120
Get out.

917
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
I'm going to heal.

918
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,360
What a pity.

919
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,760
I can't play the zither.

920
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,120
Can you walk faster?

921
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,560
How did you guess it right?

922
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,920
You see, he is

923
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,400
a man of love.

924
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,040
So what?

925
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,120
You don't?

926
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,680
He is not a man of love.

927
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,680
If you dare to lie to me,

928
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,320
I'll kill you.

929
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,320
Don't show your love.

930
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,440
Or you'll lose the first round.

931
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,760
It sounds like you said it.

932
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,000
Start.

933
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,080
Your meridians are in a mess.

934
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,440
Normal method is useless.

935
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,840
You can only use poison to poison.

936
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,720
But this method is too intense.

937
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,360
You'll suffer a great pain.

938
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,800
You can't sleep even if you're upset.

939
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,080
I believe in you.

940
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,760
How dare you.

941
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,720
No wonder

942
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,760
Xiao Heng Hui came to me for you.

943
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,200
You and Duke Su are very familiar.

944
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,120
We both have a life-saving method.

945
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,800
We can't just leave it to you.

946
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,280
I'm not afraid of it.

947
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,440
I'm not afraid of it.

948
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,680
I'm not afraid of it.

949
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,880
You're very familiar.

950
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,680
We both have a life-saving method.

951
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,560
Your hand.

952
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,160
I never said we could marry touches.

953
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,280
That means we should be wed.

954
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,800
Don't Cover-brush!

955
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,120
Hide, hide!

956
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,880
You'veDear styled your hand.

957
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,360
So worried that I'll recalcitrate your hand.

958
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,200
How is he now?

959
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,640
The poison isn't diy تes.

960
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,360
He needs two more days.

961
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,280
He'll be well.

962
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,680
Xiao Heng.

963
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,680
How can I act?

964
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,680
Xiao Heng

965
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,680
You are not

966
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,680
Falling in love with him?

967
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,680
Don't ask me this kind of question

968
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,680
You better not let me know that you are lying to me

969
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,680
Lu Ji

970
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,680
Send the second lady back

971
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,680
She is asleep

972
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,680
Master wants me to carry her back

973
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,680
Or carry her back

974
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,680
Go and send a letter to her

975
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,680
Yes

976
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,680
I am drunk

977
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,680
But I am determined to be beautiful

978
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,680
I forget

979
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,680
The soul is lost

980
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,680
How sad

981
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,680
I don't regret

982
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,680
My thoughts are not broken

983
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,680
I don't regret

984
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,680
I don't regret

985
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,680
I don't regret

986
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,680
I don't regret

987
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,680
I don't regret

988
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,680
I don't regret

989
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,680
I don't regret

990
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,680
I don't regret

991
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,680
I don't regret

992
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,680
I don't regret

993
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,680
I don't regret

994
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,680
Why should I be

995
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,680
Free

996
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,680
How is it?

997
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,680
Thank you for your kindness.

998
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,680
I will repay you for your kindness.

999
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,680
You can't repay me now.

1000
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,680
What do you mean?

1001
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,680
When people are in danger,

1002
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,680
they are like fallen leaves.

1003
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,680
Their fate is drifting.

1004
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,680
They can't be themselves.

1005
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,680
The Prime Minister's Mansion can't tolerate this kind of fallen leaves.

1006
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:43,680
If there is no memory of happiness,

1007
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:52,680
how can it cross the bottom of sadness?

1008
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,680
Two cold words,

1009
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,680
an heartless deep,

1010
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,680
a heartless deep,

1011
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,680
a heartless deep,

1012
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,680
a heartless deep,

1013
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,680
A heartless deep,

1014
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,680
holding hands,

1015
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:15,680
can it cross the snow?

1016
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,680
In the cold wind,

1017
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,680
in the long night,

1018
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:30,680
embracing the remaining warmth.

1019
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,680
Holding hands,

1020
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,680
not firmly,

1021
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:45,680
can it bury the regret of yesterday?

1022
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,680
Love is only

1023
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,680
using life to cherish,

1024
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,680
to live on,

1025
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,680
even if it's a little hurtful.

1026
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,680
No matter sorrow or joy,

1027
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,680
I believe you

1028
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:14,680
would rather be trapped in the coldness of the world.

1029
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,680
Live on,

1030
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,680
use up all your courage.

1031
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,680
Love on,

1032
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,680
until you can't breathe.

1033
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,680
Go through the loneliness of life,

1034
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,680
just to meet you.

1035
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,460
After the

1036
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,680
flying,

1037
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,680
we will not be apart.

1038
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,680
After the flying,

1039
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:53,680
we will not be apart.
