1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will not give up even if I have regrets.

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Then I will not give up.

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Slowly, I will endure the pain of life.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
After going through the cold winter, I still feel the same.

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Waiting for the spring to return again.

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will not give up even if I have regrets.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Waiting for the spring to return again.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The Legend of Chusen

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Master Xu.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I did not expect that the Eldest Princess here is so excited.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I would have come earlier if I had known.

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Grand Duke Su, His Majesty has made me treat the students well.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What is the matter with you?

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If the Eldest Princess only takes the sword that does not have a sword, then I have nothing to do with it.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It is a pity that you want to take the sword.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Those eunuchs around you cannot be the master.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Naturally, someone will come to inform me.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It seems that you are sincerely unable to get through.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How dare I? I am the seal guardian of the palace.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I will just leave it to the future.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The scholar Shen is very thoughtful.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He said that he would not care about life or death.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But what if someone really dies?

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How should I explain to His Majesty?

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That is to say, you must be disappointed in me.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I have work to do.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If the Eldest Princess wants to believe, please stop His Majesty.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will just let someone open a warehouse and transfer the building to the Eldest Princess.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I will accompany the Eldest Princess to kill her and blood flow into the river.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Grand Duke Su is so loyal to his duty.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I want to talk to the King of Cheng about it.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let my brother take good care of the work of the Grand Duke Su.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I am willing to share the burden for the King of Cheng.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you, Grand Duke Su.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You thought you were in trouble?

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I...

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I am sorry.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
His Majesty wants everyone to be careful.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I will go and check on the palace.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I will go and check on the palace.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I will go and check on the palace.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
His Majesty wants everyone to be open and happy.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I am sorry.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I am Shan Xue Shi.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It is okay.

46
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,000
Both of you should return home.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
A'Li...

48
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,920
Still сказал

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,120
EvenCAO

50
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,080
zooms into her

51
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
And then

52
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,360
kills

53
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,400
And then

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,080
Stun

55
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,720
Direct to

56
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,360
Dying

57
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,560
Xue Fengfei,

58
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,560
I'll stick you to death

59
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,360
like a little ant.

60
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,560
Jiang Li.

61
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,360
Sorry.

62
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,560
I felt like you were going to fall.

63
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,560
I'm fine.

64
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,360
I...

65
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,160
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

66
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,560
Don't take it to heart.

67
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,760
The First Princess is really too much.

68
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,760
Besides,

69
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,360
you're the daughter of the Jiangxiang State.

70
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,760
She doesn't dare to stop you.

71
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
I'll go with you.

72
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,560
Let's go back first.

73
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,760
It's not good to let others see us together.

74
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,360
Ye Xiu, where did you go?

76
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Come on, let's drink.

77
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,960
Come on, let's drink.

78
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,760
Let's drink.

79
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Come on.

80
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,360
Come on.

81
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,360
Come on.

82
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,360
Sister.

83
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,760
You were so brave

84
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,960
in front of the First Princess.

85
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,560
I want to toast you a cup of wine.

86
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,560
Sister,

87
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,360
I'm not good at drinking.

88
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
I've had enough.

89
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
I can't drink anymore.

90
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,760
You and I are sisters.

91
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,960
Our relationship is unusual.

92
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,760
How about I serve you tea instead of wine?

93
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,760
Second Sister,

94
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,560
serving you tea instead of wine

95
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
is not enough to make me

96
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,360
feel true to you.

97
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
Let's go.

98
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
In that case,

99
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
I'll follow your order.

100
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
Second Sister.

101
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,560
Simei.

102
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
My head

103
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,560
is a little dizzy.

104
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,160
Then sit down.

105
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,760
Okay.

106
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,160
Simei.

107
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,160
Why are you so dumb?

108
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
I felt dizzy.

109
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,760
Sister.

110
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,660
I just created those

111
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,320
so-called

112
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
made-up pandemic.

113
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,360
These caused an uncomfortable surprise on me.

114
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,320
I will mixture slash against the wind

115
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,840
And then

116
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,680
When the wind blows

117
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,560
The principle of assistance

118
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,880
A path of air

119
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,080
There is a word

120
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,640
Commandant your majesty

121
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,280
There are some tea rooms here

122
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,440
throughout life

123
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,000
ma'am Li

124
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,760
have arranged a place

125
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,240
for you to rest

126
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,640
Ye Yuan

127
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,720
You should rest here

128
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,560
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,640
Ye Shijie,

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
wake up.

131
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,200
You didn't drink?

132
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,920
My family is a business man.

133
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,920
I didn't drink much.

134
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,080
Today, those who came to propose,

135
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,160
some came to propose.

136
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,120
Some obviously wanted to get drunk.

137
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,760
I'm not a bad drinker.

138
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,360
Plus, I didn't drink much today.

139
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I just pretended to be drunk to see what the other party wanted.

140
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,080
Then I was brought here.

141
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,080
Then you just...

142
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,680
I just saw you sleeping.

143
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,680
I just wanted to wake you up.

144
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,200
What do they mean by bringing us here?

145
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,720
Should I say you're smart

146
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,520
or you're stupid?

147
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,280
What's the point of being single?

148
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,120
They want us to wake up after drinking.

149
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,120
Don't talk nonsense.

150
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,200
I just want to tell you about others' plans.

151
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,440
Then they did this

152
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,760
to make us wrong.

153
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,800
Don't you understand?

154
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,960
They drugged you.

155
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,440
To make us get into the wrong,

156
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,040
they ruined my reputation

157
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,880
and the Ye family's reputation.

158
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,360
After all, you were just appointed

159
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
as the foreign minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,320
So they want to kill us both?

161
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,080
Yes.

162
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,720
You didn't fall for it.

163
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,320
Neither did I.

164
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,320
If I'm really drunk tonight,

165
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,200
what will you do?

166
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,000
No.

167
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,360
When the time comes,

168
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,880
I'll stab you and then leave.

169
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,440
Others will only think

170
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,960
I'm an assassin in the palace.

171
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,440
Do you really want to do this?

172
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,880
I might be a little selfish

173
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,320
to say so.

174
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,240
But you won't understand if you haven't experienced it.

175
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,760
After the truth is out,

176
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,600
all the people

177
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,360
and all the people

178
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,800
who are despicable and cowardly

179
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,600
will humiliate you and scold you.

180
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,480
Even if you have a lot of grievances,

181
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,720
you have nowhere to go.

182
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,000
You're my cousin.

183
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,360
I feel ashamed to hurt you.

184
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,960
But I'll never enter that hell in my life.

185
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,320
Where are you going?

186
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,520
The people outside have left.

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,680
If you don't go,

188
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,080
are you waiting to be killed?

189
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,080
But you're in front of them now.

190
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,000
They'll know the plan is wrong immediately.

191
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,360
I'll find a place to hide.

192
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,680
You should find a place too.

193
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,880
four years later

194
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,520
I thought you wouldn't come.

195
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,600
I didn't expect that you really have me in your heart.

196
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Li'er, I really want to marry you.

197
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,600
You are really the rose of Crown Prince.

198
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
I will marry you.

199
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Duke Su, why are you here?

200
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
I am not here.

201
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
I can't go with you to see you two have a love affair.

202
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
You are talking nonsense again.

203
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
I am under the command of the guards.

204
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,600
I know which brick you are stepping on.

205
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Why did you kill Shen Yu Rong?

206
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
I didn't.

207
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
You forgot that I taught you how to use your sword.

208
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
There are so many people here tonight.

209
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Not a single person will be suspicious of your identity.

210
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
This is a big problem.

211
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
How did you get out?

212
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Can you let go of me first?

213
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
No.

214
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
The Ministry of Justice is still holding a person in custody.

215
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
You are holding each other's lives in your hands.

216
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Have you ever thought about it?

217
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
If someone else is holding you in custody at this time...

218
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
What do you know?

219
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Do you think only you can fool me?

220
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
What do you know?

221
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
I know nothing.

222
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
I have been in the judicial department for so many years.

223
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
I have seen many criminal cases and many criminal laws.

224
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
No one can be beaten more than the big picture.

225
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Li, you are too impulsive tonight.

226
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
How dare you say that you admire Shen Yu Rong in public?

227
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,600
You are not afraid when you see Wu turning back and taking off his bow?

228
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Aren't you the one turning back?

229
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Is my path that easy?

230
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
What price do I have to pay?

231
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
I didn't think it through.

232
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
But this is the third favor you owe me.

233
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
I want more.

234
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
When you can afford it, we'll talk about it.

235
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Duke Su.

236
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Do you really know which brick the people in the palace are stepping on?

237
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
What do you want to know?

238
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,600
I want to know which brick Shen Yu Rong and the Princess Royal are stepping on.

239
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
You have already guessed it.

240
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Why are you still asking me?

241
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Didn't you ask me why I was so impulsive tonight?

242
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
I am not you.

243
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
I don't have that much vision.

244
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
I can only risk my own life to find the truth.

245
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,600
For you, the truth is that important?

246
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
More than my life.

247
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
I am not you.

248
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
I am not you.

249
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
I am not you.

250
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I am not you.

251
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,200
Have a seat.

252
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:25,600
I justhi

253
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,520
Sisters

254
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,320
We have been manufacturers for a long time

255
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Let's have some tea.

256
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,800
Okay.

257
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,080
I'm a little thirsty.

258
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,960
I'll go with you.

259
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,080
Let's go.

260
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,000
Where are they?

261
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,120
Yes.

262
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,200
They drank the medicine.

263
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,280
They should be somewhere around here.

264
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,920
They must have gone somewhere else.

265
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,080
Let's go over there.

266
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,000
The tea table is too small.

267
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,600
It's a little cramped for us.

268
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,000
Let's go to another tea room.

269
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:05,800
Okay.

270
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,800
Look.

271
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,920
The flowers are blooming here.

272
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,600
They're beautiful.

273
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,360
When we come out later,

274
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,320
let's go there and take a look.

275
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,840
Okay.

276
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,680
Let's go.

277
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,600
Let's go in and take a look.

278
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,720
Second Sister.

279
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,840
Second Sister.

280
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Isn't...

281
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,360
Isn't this Jiang Ruoyao's fiancee?

282
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,280
She left the legitimate daughter behind

283
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,160
and is with the concubine of the Jiang family.

284
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,800
How could it be you?

285
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,000
Ruoyao.

286
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,360
I drank too much.

287
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,240
Third Sister.

288
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,280
I drank too much.

289
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,600
Get away from me.

290
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,320
You bitch.

291
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,160
You're afraid that I'll get revenge on you?

292
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,720
Save me.

293
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,520
Save me.

294
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,880
Get down.

295
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,000
Get down.

296
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Get down.

297
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,320
You bitch.

298
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,040
You bitch.

299
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,720
Shameless.

300
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,320
Bitch.

301
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,700
The

302
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,160
pain.

303
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,080
Okay. Okay.

304
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,000
It'll be fine soon.

305
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,680
You said you'd wipe at night,

306
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,520
wipe in the morning,

307
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,280
wipe at noon,

308
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,160
wipe, wipe, wipe.

309
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Other than wiping the medicine,

310
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,480
do you have anything else to do?

311
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,200
You can't make the big deal.

312
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,800
You're being ruled out by the small things.

313
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,040
How many grievances have we suffered

314
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,720
in this family?

315
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,600
Look at your daughter's face.

316
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
It's all ruined.

317
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,160
You're the head of the family.

318
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,360
Do you only know how to wipe the medicine?

319
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,240
We deserve to be bullied.

320
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,200
The needle is gone.

321
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,320
The lotus is ruined.

322
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,160
We should just let it go.

323
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,480
If the dog is bitten,

324
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,280
you have to help me call for help.

325
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,040
Enough.

326
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,960
Get out.

327
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
My daughter.

328
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,600
Our lives

329
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,400
are really so bitter.

330
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,040
Mother.

331
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,200
I'm not bitter.

332
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,560
I want to marry Mr. Zhou.

333
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,120
What nonsense are you talking about?

334
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,720
Mr. Zhou

335
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,440
is your third sister's fiancee.

336
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,960
Look at your father's identity.

337
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
How can we take the responsibility?

338
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Now,

339
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,640
if you want to marry the Zhou family,

340
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,800
you have to be very careful.

341
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,360
At that time, our whole family

342
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,000
will be in trouble.

343
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,960
My face was ruined by Jiang Ruoyao.

344
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,520
My innocence was ruined by Zhou Yanbang.

345
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,240
No decent family would want me.

346
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Can I stay at home for the rest of my life?

347
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Or you want to send me to Zhennv Hall?

348
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,320
You...

349
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

350
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,040
Now,

351
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,360
you only know to blame me.

352
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,200
You see Jiang Ruoyao

353
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,840
is a generous daughter.

354
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,760
You always tell me to be a bitch

355
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,360
and let him humiliate the family.

356
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,400
My cat is still alive.

357
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,040
Jiang Li has a decent family.

358
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,320
What did you plan for me?

359
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,560
Now I've taken a step on Jiang Ruoyao

360
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,720
and put him down.

361
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,400
The house hasn't been taken over yet.

362
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Father came to see me first.

363
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,880
Why can't I marry Mr. Zhou?

364
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
My daughter.

365
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,160
You...

366
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,160
You're overestimating yourself.

367
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,120
You not only ruined yourself,

368
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,840
but also ruined my family's reputation.

369
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,240
How can you blame your parents

370
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,560
for not planning for you?

371
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,320
What else can I do?

372
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,680
I'm just a daughter of a concubine.

373
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,280
I also want my father to be the chancellor.

374
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,880
You...

375
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,080
You always ask me questions.

376
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,760
You're so arrogant today.

377
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,880
I think I'm right.

378
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,680
Just because you're a concubine,

379
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,720
you're always so arrogant.

380
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,800
She's generous.

381
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,360
What is she?

382
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,760
Concubine?

383
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,040
I'm a good son, right?

384
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,400
It's all my fault.

385
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,040
Cheer up.

386
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,080
It's not the time to cry.

387
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,640
It's urgent.

388
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,760
We have to think of a way

389
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,280
to get through this.

390
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,080
We can't escape.

391
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,360
Jiang Ruoyao's marriage is ruined.

392
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
Do you know how much effort

393
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,880
Da Fang has put into this marriage?

394
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,480
We can stay here

395
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,800
because they haven't killed him yet.

396
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,280
I don't think so.

397
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,360
Why are you staring at me?

398
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,960
Who can tell the difference between a man and a woman?

399
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,480
It's the son of the Marquis of the Marquis

400
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,920
who used force on our daughter.

401
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,200
We're wronged.

402
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,280
Why doesn't he

403
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,240
give us any justice?

404
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,280
Why does he let Jiang Ruoyao

405
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,200
ruin our daughter's face?

406
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,960
I have to fight him.

407
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,040
Ma'am,

408
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,880
calm down.

409
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,080
Even if we get through this,

410
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,160
I won't let Ruoyao

411
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,520
and Yu'e get married.

412
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,800
Sister-in-law won't give up easily.

413
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
That's the future.

414
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,760
The top priority now

415
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,640
is not to let our Yu'e

416
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,080
and Jiang Ruoyao fight against each other.

417
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,600
As long as they have

418
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,360
common enemies,

419
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,200
it will be easier.

420
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,120
You mean...

421
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,800
Jiang Li.

422
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,880
Mrs. Sun.

423
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,960
Go.

424
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,800
Make the people

425
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,280
clean up here

426
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,080
and change a new one for him.

427
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,400
Yes.

428
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,400
Is that enough?

429
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,880
I think he's a loyal dog.

430
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,760
No matter what,

431
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,320
he won't steal food from others.

432
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,080
That's why I always take him with me.

433
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,480
I didn't expect

434
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,280
he would steal from me.

435
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Mother,

436
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,040
how can I

437
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,600
take this?

438
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,240
You still think you're wrong?

439
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,920
I didn't do anything wrong.

440
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,920
Even if you upset

441
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,880
Jiang Yu'e,

442
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,400
you shouldn't

443
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,680
break her face in front of everyone.

444
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,800
When she gets back to the house,

445
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,240
there will be a thousand ways

446
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,960
to torture her.

447
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,920
Now Jiang Yu'e is a bad person.

448
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,280
Your father

449
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,040
is the eldest son of the head of the family.

450
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,520
He is the son-in-law of the kind and kind.

451
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,560
He's ashamed.

452
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,120
Luckily, he cried

453
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,800
in front of your father.

454
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,960
We have to save him.

455
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,080
You thought you were out of breath.

456
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,880
How can you know

457
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,040
you left him a chance?

458
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,760
He's already dead.

459
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,800
But you can turn him over

460
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,960
with just one inch.

461
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,360
He wanted to seduce my fiance.

462
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,880
What's the evidence?

463
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,960
If he killed

464
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,640
Zhou Yanbang and raped him,

465
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,480
what would you say?

466
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,200
So it turned out like this.

467
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,160
It's my fault, right?

468
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,080
Am I just

469
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,400
watching others

470
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,920
ruin my marriage?

471
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,440
You and the Zhou family's engagement

472
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,240
have no chance to turn back.

473
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,200
Your father would never agree

474
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,720
you marry into the Zhou family.

475
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,640
If you insist on marrying into the family,

476
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,240
the Zhou family will not marry you.

477
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,680
It doesn't matter if you accept it or not.

478
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,760
This is the reality.

479
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,360
Repentance.

480
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,040
It must be a revenge.

481
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,000
If I didn't listen to you

482
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,800
and framed Jiang Li and Ye Shijian,

483
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,960
I wouldn't have been punished.

484
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,520
You can't do your own thing well.

485
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,920
You're being reasonable.

486
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,840
Do you think only Jiang Yu'e

487
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,800
can seduce Zhou Yanbang?

488
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,880
You've been engaged to Mr. Zhou

489
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,320
for a few days.

490
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,800
If he wants to seduce you,

491
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,280
why didn't he do it earlier?

492
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,920
You mean

493
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,560
he was used by others?

494
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,680
Now you and Jiang Yu'e

495
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,880
are in such a mess.

496
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,160
Who do you think

497
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,240
is the happiest in this family?

498
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,640
Jiang Li.

499
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,400
The engagement is over.

500
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,680
I'll find you a better one.

501
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,400
But this is

502
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,760
the truth.

503
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,120
You must make it clear to the person who really hurt you.

504
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
Yuanbai is here too.

505
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,320
What do you want to say?

506
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,800
Brother.

507
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,720
You...

508
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,680
You can punish me.

509
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,200
Why are you all talking?

510
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,600
How can you be so rude?

511
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,000
Yu'e ruined

512
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,200
the marriage of Ruoyao and the Zhou family.

513
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,800
I was the one who was rude.

514
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,960
I'm sorry to you.

515
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,040
You deserve it.

516
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,920
You made a big trouble yesterday.

517
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,480
That's the palace,

518
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,600
not your backyard.

519
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,040
I know why you're angry.

520
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,480
If we investigate it,

521
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,040
it's a big trouble

522
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,080
for our family.

523
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,120
They're really unreasonable.

524
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,480
But now,

525
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
His Majesty didn't say anything.

526
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,920
That's their fate.

527
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,160
About yesterday,

528
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,680
I had a private understanding

529
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,760
with Lady Ningyuan.

530
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,040
After all, both families are not good-looking.

531
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,360
They want to cover it up.

532
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,440
It's not a big deal.

533
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,840
But there won't be any big trouble.

534
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,960
Today, in the court,

535
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,280
the public is looking at me with a smile.

536
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,320
Yuanxing.

537
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,760
If Yu'e really has feelings for Mr. Zhou,

538
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,840
you should have told me earlier.

539
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,240
Why did you do this?

540
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,880
It's a shameful thing.

541
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,680
I'm not a good son.

542
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,200
Please punish me.

543
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,840
And your good daughter.

544
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,360
She hurt her cousin's face.

545
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,160
If this bad news is spread,

546
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
who dares to propose marriage?

547
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,720
Mother.

548
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,440
Ruoyao is wrong.

549
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,000
But she and Mr. Zhou have a deep relationship since childhood.

550
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,080
It's normal to lose your mind

551
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,480
in a sudden situation.

552
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,680
If it wasn't for Yu'e's fault,

553
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,280
Ruoyao wouldn't do this.

554
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,600
It's Yu'e's fault

555
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,120
to say so.

556
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,960
I brought Yu'e here today.

557
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,160
If you want to punish me,

558
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,400
I'll let you do it.

559
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,760
Ruoyao and Yu'e

560
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,840
get along well.

561
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,600
We're close to the Zhou family.

562
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,360
It's not a matter of a day or two.

563
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,520
Because Ruoyao hasn't married,

564
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,680
I can see

565
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,640
the private things they usually get along with.

566
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,600
Yu'e is fine.

567
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,760
Why would she suddenly get confused?

568
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,080
If Ruoyao didn't see it and tell me,

569
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,560
I wouldn't believe it.

570
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,000
If it wasn't for the frame,

571
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,520
even if Yu'e

572
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,640
dares to do it,

573
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,400
she wouldn't dare to do it.

574
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,000
Frame?

575
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,360
Who framed her?

576
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,720
Yu'e,

577
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,720
you should tell me.

578
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,480
Uncle, auntie,

579
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,120
I'm not good at drinking.

580
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,720
But on the day of the banquet,

581
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,760
my second sister was drinking with me.

582
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,400
When I was drunk and dizzy,

583
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,920
my second sister was holding me up.

584
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,040
She said she would take me to the tea room to rest.

585
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,400
I remember

586
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,880
we had been walking for a long time.

587
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,760
Now that I think about it,

588
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,120
I'm afraid we're at the wrong place.

589
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,920
When we arrived at the door of the room,

590
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,920
my second sister left.

591
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,640
I was so dizzy that I didn't think much.

592
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,120
I just wanted to rest.

593
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,600
So I went into the room.

594
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,680
But Mr. Zhou was also inside.

595
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,400
He was drunk.

596
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,120
He also recognized me as my third sister.

597
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,760
Then...

598
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,400
Yu'e.

599
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,440
I was so panicked at that time.

600
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,840
I tried my best to struggle.

601
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,040
But I was too weak to drink.

602
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,320
I was too weak.

603
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,440
I couldn't even compete with a man.

604
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,520
Then my third sister appeared.

605
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,760
If this is a remote place,

606
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,000
why would Ruo Yao go there?

607
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,920
I...

608
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,480
I dare not say it.

609
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,320
Yu'e,

610
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,280
just say it.

611
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,120
Yu'e.

612
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,600
It doesn't matter.

613
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
I said I heard someone else say it later.

614
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,320
After my second sister took me to the tea room,

615
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,920
I told my third sister that

616
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,840
she couldn't find me.

617
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,560
My third sister was worried about me.

618
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,280
So she went into the tea room in a hurry.

619
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,880
Then...

620
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,960
Then...

621
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,640
There is such a thing?

622
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,040
It's my fault.

623
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,080
It's my fault.

624
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,720
If I knew it,

625
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,840
I shouldn't have brought the wine

626
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,600
that my second sister brought to me.

627
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,320
I wouldn't have made such a big mistake.

628
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,480
Call Jiang Ruo Yao and Jiang Li here.

629
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,120
Tell the truth to the two families.

630
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,000
I will not let anyone else know

631
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,040
who is to blame.

632
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,560
That day, the banquet was too dangerous.

633
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,040
Fortunately, my sister was careful.

634
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,840
The investigation was successful.

635
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,880
It was as expected.

636
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,840
Sister,

637
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,200
that person is...

638
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,240
the First Princess.

639
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,160
I'm afraid it will be more difficult in the future.

640
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,360
I thought

641
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,760
that the face-to-face meeting would be my only chance.

642
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,720
To break the curtain

643
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,440
and let her come to see me.

644
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,280
But I never thought

645
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,480
that it would be Your Highness

646
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,560
who would be so cold-hearted

647
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,040
and not leave.

648
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,280
Sister,

649
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,080
you don't feel sorry for Shen Yu Rong, do you?

650
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,480
Killing a wife

651
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,280
is a crime that should be punished.

652
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,240
I feel sorry for her.

653
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,720
She doesn't deserve it.

654
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,800
Sister,

655
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,080
what are we going to do in the future?

656
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,400
If theeler I kill

657
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,640
is due the death of a wife to you,

658
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,960
this is so cruel.

659
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,560
My lady,

660
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,800
master�� 남신은

661
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:59,500
to go to the

662
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,500
He's awake

663
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,060
Li'er

664
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,180
What happened in the palace yesterday?

665
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,060
Father

666
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,820
Li'er was drunk yesterday

667
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,180
I don't know what you want to ask

668
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,260
Stop pretending

669
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,220
Tell me clearly about

670
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,220
Jiang Yu'e and the Zhongyuan Gang

671
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,380
You want to ask about this?

672
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,580
I was drunk by Fourth Sister for a long time yesterday

673
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,140
I was a little drunk

674
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,940
Fourth Sister helped me to rest in the nearby room

675
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,100
I heard about the matter of Mr. Zhou and Fourth Sister

676
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,420
after I woke up today

677
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,900
You're talking nonsense

678
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,300
How could you not know?

679
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,940
If you didn't do it secretly

680
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,860
how could Fourth Sister

681
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,140
just enter the Zhongyuan Gang?

682
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,900
I'm afraid you planned it secretly

683
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,500
and deliberately led Fourth Sister there

684
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,420
Yes

685
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,420
I knew Mr. Zhou was in there after I went in

686
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,900
It's a coincidence

687
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,740
After Fourth Sister helped me to rest in the room

688
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,780
she just lied to me

689
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,140
Another person also entered my room

690
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,260
under the shadow of the officer

691
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,540
Do you know who this person is?

692
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,580
How could I know?

693
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,740
It's Ye Shijie

694
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,300
He was also drunk

695
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,700
and wanted to find a place to rest

696
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,620
But I don't know why

697
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,060
he was taken to my room

698
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,780
But fortunately

699
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,660
although we were drunk

700
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,180
we knew that men and women are different

701
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,940
We were in the same room and had different reasons

702
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,460
Then we went out separately

703
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:30,860
By the way

704
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,780
I also heard a news

705
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,340
Third Sister pushed Mr. Zhou away

706
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,900
when he was in the room

707
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,700
She didn't see him

708
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,420
and she shouted

709
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,460
Second Sister

710
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,180
Why did she do that?

711
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,180
You're talking nonsense

712
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,180
I didn't

713
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,940
The students who were with you

714
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,220
heard it

715
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,940
Why did Third Sister suddenly deny it?

716
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,740
In fact, it's normal to shout the wrong person under the banner

717
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,060
Third Sister doesn't have to be so nervous

718
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:57,900
Father

719
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,860
I only had half a cup of tea after I entered the room

720
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,300
Ye Shijie came in

721
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,540
Then we went back to our separate rooms

722
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,180
Ye Shijie can prove that

723
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,780
I didn't have time to send Fourth Sister

724
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,100
to Mr. Zhou's room

725
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,500
Ye Shijie is your cousin

726
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,900
He's talking to you

727
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,220
Maybe you two are colluding

728
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,500
I forgot you

729
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,540
If I sent you to Mr. Zhou's room

730
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,220
but he didn't behave well to you

731
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,060
why didn't you shout the wrong person?

732
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,060
There are so many people in the palace

733
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,380
If you keep shouting the wrong person

734
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,420
things may not be the way they are now

735
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,460
That's because

736
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,660
if I shout the wrong person

737
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,020
and get hit by someone

738
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,660
I'm afraid it will affect

739
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,780
Third Sister and Mr. Zhou's reputation

740
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,140
Third Sister

741
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,900
Are you touched?

742
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,620
I'd rather ruin my reputation

743
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,660
than to protect your reputation and Mr. Zhou's

744
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,300
You two are really sisters

745
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,580
Li'er

746
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,940
Don't irritate your sister anymore

747
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,660
After this

748
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,220
she feels worse than anyone else

749
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,620
I feel bad for my sister too

750
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,500
But I never thought

751
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,380
all the dirty water

752
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,660
would fall on Li'er

753
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,020
Can't I defend myself

754
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,340
for a while?

755
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,580
Stop making excuses

756
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,540
You're the one who spilled the dirty water

757
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,180
Maybe Ye Shijie

758
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,940
colluded with you

759
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,340
when he was breaking the world

760
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,540
That's why you think he's a shield

761
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,180
You can believe Ye Shijie

762
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,300
but you can't believe Duke Su

763
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,020
What's wrong with him?

764
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,820
Father

765
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,460
It's because Fourth Sister

766
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,700
sent me to the room

767
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,180
When Li'er left

768
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,460
she didn't know the way back

769
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,660
She happened to meet Duke Su

770
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,220
Duke Su sent her back to the front hall

771
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,900
Father wanted to

772
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,900
defend her

773
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,260
I know that

774
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,580
but pushing me out is a small thing

775
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,980
If others know

776
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,460
that we are not a good match

777
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,820
they can hurt each other

778
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,260
I don't know

779
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,580
what kind of evil intentions they will have

780
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,380
Please think twice

781
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,020
Jiang Li, stop pretending

782
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,820
Shunya

783
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,180
I'm a woman of honor

784
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,780
I can't just let it go

785
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,780
My life is so hard

786
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,460
What should I do in my life?

787
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,780
What should my daughter do in the future?

788
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,740
Enough

789
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,620
What's the point of

790
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,660
arguing over such a family feud?

791
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,700
Spreading it out

792
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,380
and letting people know

793
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,140
that the sisters of the Ghost Clan

794
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,260
spilled the dirty water

795
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,940
is a big joke

796
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,020
The right and wrong

797
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,180
are the most important things

798
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,380
in a family feud

799
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,700
You don't think about it

800
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,660
The fourth girl is now ruined

801
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,820
What should we do in the future?

802
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,940
The third girl

803
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,540
did this for her husband

804
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,580
What should we do in the future?

805
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,180
I can't handle

806
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,980
the things that mother has to blame

807
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,340
I will discuss with the third sister

808
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,820
how to solve this matter

809
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,020
You go out and discuss

810
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,700
Don't disturb me here

811
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,660
Yes

812
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,140
Second girl

813
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,100
You stay here

814
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,220
What's going on

815
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,620
between Yu'e and Mr. Zhou?

816
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,140
Grandma loves Li'er the most

817
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,900
Li'er won't hide from grandma

818
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:16,980
Last night

819
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,260
she was in the bathroom

820
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,460
and she was in the bathroom

821
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,460
She was in the bathroom

822
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,460
and she was in the bathroom

823
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,460
She was in the bathroom

824
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,460
and she was in the bathroom

825
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,460
She was in the bathroom

826
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,540
Last night

827
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,900
Zhou Yanbang gave me

828
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,020
a piece of paper

829
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,820
I didn't want to care about it

830
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,220
and I was afraid that others would know

831
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:31,980
Li'er

832
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,100
put it on her

833
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,620
I thought I would deal with it

834
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,660
after the banquet

835
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,980
Until I heard about

836
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,260
the matter between the fourth sister and Mr. Zhou

837
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,220
I found out that the paper on Li'er

838
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,660
disappeared at some point

839
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,540
You are really a girl who doesn't know the importance

840
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,060
Get up

841
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,240
What are you MacBook canon

842
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,940
through Tue

843
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,420
Lazying

844
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,140
Page

845
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,460
no 0

846
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,100
OK

847
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,220
Well

848
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,540
This will be the last gift

849
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,620
Sorry

850
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,340
I've made the mistake

851
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,100
Please forgive me

852
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,660
You were buried in the water first.

853
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,260
Then you came to marry me.

854
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,220
Then you had a good time with the man who spilled the water.

855
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,020
You are a family.

856
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,500
You are related to each other.

857
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,860
In the end, you have to suffer.

858
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,980
Grandma.

859
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,300
You don't trust me as your grandmother?

860
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,340
I dare not.

861
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,940
You can tell your grandmother

862
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,100
no matter what happens in the future.

863
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,220
I'm not that kind of person who doesn't know right from wrong.

864
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,460
But you can't not punish me for this.

865
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,260
I'll punish you ten times for copying the Buddhist scriptures.

866
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,100
I'll punish the three girls and four girls

867
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,540
twenty times for copying the Women's World.

868
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,380
I'll accept the punishment.

869
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,020
Dad.

870
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,100
Why did you let me marry Jiao Yi He?

871
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,860
What is his identity?

872
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,300
How can he deserve me?

873
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,900
What?

874
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,900
You still want to marry Jiang Ruo Yao?

875
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,420
Dad, I'm begging you.

876
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,860
I know I did wrong.

877
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,980
I'll apologize to Ruo Yao.

878
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,180
She will forgive me.

879
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,900
Dad.

880
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,940
Forgive you?

881
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,300
Dad.

882
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,380
You made such a big trouble.

883
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,500
You are in trouble.

884
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,180
You are still not awake.

885
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,140
Do you think you can marry Jiang Ruo Yao?

886
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,340
Look carefully.

887
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,300
The marriage contract of the Jiang family is sent to our mansion.

888
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,740
Jiang Yu'e is a daughter of a concubine.

889
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,020
But now,

890
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,700
if she doesn't have a child,

891
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,100
and she's confused and makes a living,

892
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,020
His Majesty will be furious.

893
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,660
He won't say if the Jiang family will give up.

894
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,820
All the public decrees of the ancestors

895
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,820
will be lost forever.

896
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,180
Do you understand?

897
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:01,740
Dad.

898
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,380
But I...

899
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,420
I'm telling you.

900
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,020
Why did you marry Jiang Yu'e?

901
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,140
That's your business.

902
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,140
But she lost her child because of you.

903
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,660
Our Zhou family

904
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,220
must give her a child.

905
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,140
She is a daughter of a concubine.

906
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,140
I've paved the way for you.

907
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,780
But you walked on the wrong path.

908
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,780
You let others take the lead.

909
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,740
You are right.

910
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,940
I will take care of Ruo Yao.

911
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,940
As long as the Jiang family is still here,

912
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,340
we can still deal with them.

913
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,540
If I didn't fight in the court in front of His Majesty,

914
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,820
I'm afraid it won't be easy to end this matter.

915
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,820
You've worked hard.

916
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,820
Is there any news recently?

917
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,340
I heard from the imperial physician that

918
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,820
it won't be good if it's delayed for a few years.

919
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,740
But my father asked you to ask me.

920
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,860
No.

921
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,940
It's just my own stupid idea.

922
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,260
It's not stupid idea.

923
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,340
It's not something urgent.

924
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,340
I'm getting old now.

925
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,340
I'm not as young as I used to be.

926
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,620
I heard that

927
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,860
I'm going to Qingqiu for a while

928
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,340
to have the Buddha's mercy.

929
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,940
I need to get well

930
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,940
and have the blessing of cultivating my children.

931
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,940
If you want to cultivate Buddha,

932
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,940
I have a favor to ask.

933
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,940
It depends on what you think.

934
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,940
Tell me.

935
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,340
Tell me what?

936
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,660
If so,

937
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,000
then I'll

938
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,720
llo the good fortune

939
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,500
as my mother.

940
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:39,940
Can you cross the snow with your hands?

941
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:47,940
In the cold wind, in the long night

942
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:55,940
