1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I will never give up.

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Then I will not give up.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Slowly, I will endure the pain of life.

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
After going through the cold winter, I still feel the same.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Waiting for the spring to return in the rain.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
After going through the cold winter, I still feel the same.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Waiting for the spring to return in the rain.

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How long has the Third Madam been in there?

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The whole day. She didn't eat.

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
She even ordered that no one should be disturbed.

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The evil poison is made from the evil poison on the needle.

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If you use it on the needle, you will have hallucinations.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If the victim can't bear it,

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
she will be completely in a state of madness.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will personally ask the Madam.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Believe me, it's useless.

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I will personally ask the Madam.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You believe me, it's useless. You have to believe yourself.

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you can't bear the pain for a while, I can't save you either.

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I understand.

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I understand.

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I understand.

23
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I understand.

24
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I understand.

25
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why did you help me?

26
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's over.

27
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I have to go and apply another medicine.

28
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If she starts to shake, call me immediately.

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

30
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You are here to seduce Jiang Li again?

31
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Then who are you going to kick out?

32
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I just want to help the Second Madam.

33
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Moreover, Jiang Ruoyao and I have not decided on our marriage.

34
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You go back now and destroy the engagement with Jiang Ruoyao.

35
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Destroy it and then marry Jiang Li.

36
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Jiang Li, don't think of taking her away from me.

37
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I won't lose to you.

38
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I won't before, and I won't tomorrow.

39
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
No, I have to detoxify.

40
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't try to escape.

41
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
She is not in a state of panic.

42
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's just that her heart has been suppressed for too long.

43
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do you think she can bear it?

44
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Even if it's a great disaster, she can bear it.

45
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's you!

46
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Do you think no one knows what you did?

47
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There are good and evil in heaven.

48
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I will not let you go this life.

49
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can't even stay in the Mingyi Hall.

50
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What did you steal from me?

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Your hand is useless.

52
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can't be heartless!

53
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
My hand!

54
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We can't go on.

55
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If we don't detoxify, she can't bear it.

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
A'Li, see who you are in front of you.

57
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
A'Li!

58
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A'Li!

59
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Jiang Li!

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Jiang Li!

61
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't be afraid.

62
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You...

63
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Rebellious.

64
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
A'Li!

65
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Mister, you didn't sleep all night?

66
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's already dawn.

67
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes.

68
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Mister, you've been driving all night.

69
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Remember.

70
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You must bless Jiang Li.

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You must be better than Jiang Ruo Yao.

72
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If Jiang Li wins, I'll bring you good food.

73
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Xu'er, your hand is injured.

74
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Are you still going?

75
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I must go to Jiang Li's musical score.

76
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You must be the most dazzling in the competition.

77
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I've already prepared everything for you.

78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't let me down today.

79
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay, Mother.

80
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Chu Xun is acting like a lady today.

81
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He changed so slowly.

82
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why don't you go in and have a look?

83
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay.

84
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I used this hand to kill Consort Xue.

85
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I buried her myself.

86
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Now, Jiang Li is Jiang Li.

87
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No matter how much she looks like her,

88
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
she's not Consort Xue.

89
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Sister, do your best.

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I believe in you.

91
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll do my best.

92
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll do my best.

93
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll do my best.

94
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll do my best.

95
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I believe in you.

96
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Everyone, please be ready.

97
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The son of Prime Minister Li, Li Lian,

98
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and the daughter of Prime Minister Jiang,

99
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Jiang Li's bet is 150.

100
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
150.

101
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Jiang Ruo Yao's team has broken the rules.

102
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
She's the only one left.

103
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why hasn't the odds changed at all?

104
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
How can you talk so harshly?

105
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
How can you have so many traitors?

106
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think you're putting all the family members

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
under the pressure of the son of Li family.

108
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You don't want to be the one to be punished.

109
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Anyway, whoever wins or loses,

110
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
we'll see.

111
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay.

112
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on.

113
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Everyone, think about it.

114
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's bet.

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll bet.

116
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Come on.

117
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's bet.

118
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Come on.

119
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's bet.

120
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let's bet.

121
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's bet.

122
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's bet.

123
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Come on.

124
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Let's bet.

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's bet.

126
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Let's bet.

127
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's bet.

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's bet.

129
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They're pretty good.

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah.

131
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
They almost beat the family.

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What a big bet.

133
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah.

134
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What are you looking at?

135
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah.

136
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If she goes, she'll win.

137
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah.

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah.

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
See?

140
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Now everyone is

141
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
looking down on us.

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And there are still a lot of people

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
who are against Meng Hong Jin.

144
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm sure it's not easy for them to win.

145
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah.

146
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's hard to tell.

147
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I think it's hard to tell.

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But I think it's worth it.

149
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There are a lot of people

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
who are against Meng Hong Jin.

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
They're regretful.

152
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

153
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Today is the last game.

154
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You're the leader.

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Come on.

156
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Brother.

157
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The bad guys across the street

158
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
are watching us.

159
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You two said

160
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
someone would be

161
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the one to show us the way.

162
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So in front of so many people,

163
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
it shouldn't be you.

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
All the students,

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
come here and draw lots.

166
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The ninth place, Liu Yuzhu.

167
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The tenth place, Wang Qingqing.

168
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The eleventh place, Jiang Ruoyao.

169
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The twelfth place, Jiang Li.

170
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Please take the exam

171
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
in the order of drawing lots.

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Today, Qin Yi is the examiner.

173
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There are five examiners.

174
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The only examiner is

175
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Gold and red fairy.

176
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Gold and red fairy?

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Isn't she the first in Wangxian House?

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
She was a gold in the first place.

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's said that Gold and red fairy

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
was a maid since Wangxian House.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
She went to Wangxian House

182
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and got her hands dirty after she left.

183
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I didn't expect to see her again.

184
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The music teacher of the palace, Nianju.

185
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Nianju is a master.

186
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And she really dares to say it.

187
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The top of the Golden Hall, Shen Yurong.

188
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Look.

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's the top of the Chixing, Shen Xunshi.

190
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Shen Xunshi also knows Qin Yi.

191
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I heard that his wife

192
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
has a good Qin Yi.

193
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The next one.

194
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Sir, the next one is not here yet.

195
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Should we wait for him?

196
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Because things are always unusual.

197
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's good that he didn't come.

198
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Let's start.

199
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Qin Yi's trial

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
starts now.

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Mr. Xiao is very anxious.

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Duke of Su, Xiao Heng.

203
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm here.

204
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm here.

205
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm here.

206
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm here.

207
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm here.

208
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm here.

209
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm here.

210
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm here.

211
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm here.

212
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm here.

213
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm here.

214
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm here.

215
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm here.

216
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm here.

217
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm here.

218
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Duke of Su.

219
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Please.

220
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He really invited Duke of Su?

221
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's really a big surprise.

222
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
His mouth is kneeling in the smoke room.

223
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Which singer is in love

224
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and doesn't want him to sing a few lines?

225
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
How did Xiao Tao Hong live?

226
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You forgot?

227
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The game starts now.

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm here.

229
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm here.

230
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm here.

231
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm here.

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm here.

233
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm here.

234
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm here.

235
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm here.

236
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm here.

237
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm here.

238
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm here.

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm here.

240
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm here.

241
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm here.

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Next.

243
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Jiang Ruo Yao.

244
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Jiang Ruo Yao.

245
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:52,120
We could go together

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,400
Something feels intriguing.

247
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,800
Just like Popping

248
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,120
I am scared,م Season 4

249
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
It's really a piece of cake.

250
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
This is the most difficult piece in the world.

251
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
No one dares to play it at all.

252
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
The third time is really extraordinary.

253
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,120
This piece is made of the wisdom of the red fox.

254
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
The heart of the Yi clan.

255
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
It's extremely difficult to play.

256
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
I didn't expect the third lady of the Jiang family

257
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
could play this piece.

258
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
It's really not easy.

259
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Fairy,

260
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
you are also full of

261
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
the Yan's spirit because of the Yelue sand, right?

262
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,120
Eh?

263
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
When she said that,

264
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
this student really

265
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
has a few of your shadow.

266
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Indeed.

267
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
The younger generation is very capable.

268
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
The red fox fairy

269
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
has been to him in private?

270
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Yes.

271
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
The red fox fairy

272
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
is really a piece of cake.

273
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,120
It's really a piece of cake.

274
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
It's really a piece of cake.

275
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,120
It's really a piece of cake.

276
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,120
It's really a piece of cake.

277
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
It's really a piece of cake.

278
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
It's really a piece of cake.

279
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
It's really a piece of cake.

280
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
It's really a piece of cake.

281
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
It's really a piece of cake.

282
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,120
It's really a piece of cake.

283
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,120
It's really a piece of cake.

284
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
It's really a piece of cake.

285
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,120
It's really a piece of cake.

286
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
The red fox fairy

287
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
is really a piece of cake.

288
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
It's really a piece of cake.

289
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
It's really a piece of cake.

290
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
It's really a piece of cake.

291
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
It's really a piece of cake.

292
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
It's really a piece of cake.

293
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
It's really a piece of cake.

294
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
It's really a piece of cake.

295
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
It's really a piece of cake.

296
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
It's really a piece of cake.

297
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
It's really a piece of cake.

298
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
It's really a piece of cake.

299
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
It's really a piece of cake.

300
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
It's really a piece of cake.

301
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
It's really a piece of cake.

302
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
You're still carrying me?

303
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
You're still carrying me?

304
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
I...

305
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
I...

306
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
I...

307
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
I...

308
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
I...

309
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
I can still hear you.

310
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
I...

311
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
I...

312
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
I...

313
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
I...

314
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
I...

315
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
I...

316
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,360
You're young and have tried the world

317
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,960
You can talk about the sun IT SOUNDS

318
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,240
And there is the love story

319
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,160
After you bring up the sun IT SOUNDS

320
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,040
You not come to mind

321
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,840
But Nobel prize for the Ruthless

322
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,920
That's so fight

323
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,880
Yeah, who is this?

324
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,240
Who is this?

325
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,200
Who is this?

326
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Who is this?

327
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,960
The twelfth, Jiang Li

328
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,400
Jiang Li is behind Jiang Ruoyang

329
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,800
He must be at a disadvantage

330
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,240
God bless me

331
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
God bless me

332
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
God bless me

333
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
God bless me

334
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Come and see this zither

335
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
Do you like it?

336
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
I like it

337
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Dad, this zither is very expensive

338
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
There is another one at home

339
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Let's return it

340
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
Your father saved the money

341
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
He wanted to buy wine

342
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,240
But he thought it would be better to buy a zither for his daughter

343
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Look, your zither has been used for years

344
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
It's time to change to a new one

345
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,240
No, dad, this zither is too expensive

346
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
If I had known that it was so expensive

347
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
I wouldn't have learned it

348
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,240
Li, don't say that

349
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
You like zithers

350
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Besides, you are a good player

351
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
Maybe one day you will have the opportunity

352
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
to play zithers

353
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Why can't we start?

354
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Why can't we start?

355
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Why can't we start?

356
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Why is it so late?

357
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
It's normal

358
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
The place where the zither is played is not a good place

359
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
What's wrong?

360
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Don't worry

361
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
It's so beautiful

362
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
So beautiful

363
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
It's so beautiful

364
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
What's this?

365
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
Playing such a little song

366
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
is embarrassing

367
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
Does he know how to play the zither?

368
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
Before the zither was played

369
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
it was really hard to play

370
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
What's this song?

371
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Why haven't I heard it before?

372
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
He is playing

373
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,240
the song of the phoenix and the white lily

374
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
I have heard it before

375
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
It's a song about the phoenix and the white lily

376
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
When I was traveling

377
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
I have heard this music

378
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,240
It's just a folk tune

379
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,240
It's impressive because of the music

380
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
But how can it be compared with

381
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
the phoenix and the white lily?

382
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,240
It's like the difference between the clouds and the mud

383
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
This is the folk tune that you mentioned

384
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
the zither is still the same

385
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
but the technique and the law of play

386
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
have changed

387
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
I don't know what to do

388
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
I can't play it

389
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,240
You can play it

390
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
I can't play it

391
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
I can't play it

392
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
I can't play it

393
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
I can't play it

394
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
I can't play it

395
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,240
I can't play it

396
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
The sound of your zither

397
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,240
I can see the world

398
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,240
I can see the world

399
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
It's wonderful

400
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
It's like I have a life

401
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
I can't play it

402
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
I can't play it

403
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
I can't play it

404
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
I can't play it

405
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
I can't play it

406
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
I can't play it

407
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
I can't play it

408
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
I can't play it

409
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
I can't play it

410
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
I can't play it

411
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
I can't play it

412
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
I can't play it

413
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
I can't play it

414
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
I can't play it

415
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
I can't play it

416
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
I can't play it

417
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
I can't play it

418
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
I can't play it

419
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
I can't play it

420
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
I can't play it

421
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
I can't play it

422
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
I can't play it

423
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,240
I can't play it

424
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
I can't play it

425
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
I can't play it

426
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
I can't play it

427
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
I can't play it

428
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
I can't play it

429
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
I can't play it

430
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
I can't play it

431
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,240
I can't play it

432
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
I can't play it

433
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
I can't play it

434
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,240
I can't play it

435
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,240
It's like there's a deep helplessness

436
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,120
Actually, yesterday morning,

437
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,480
I plant the peasant singing

438
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:29,260
and

439
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,740
deliver the orchids to the Transportation Department mall.

440
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,740
The best customers

441
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,060
are their Kellerlooking.

442
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,020
One can regret

443
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,060
if he already has an offering.

444
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,660
A girl can't play such easily AND Aaah

445
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,700
to make her feel that she did not deserve

446
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,860
Are you still that我說giggles

447
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,860
Love has trapped you

448
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:11,860
I can't help but feel sad when I see you.

449
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:19,860
I can't help but feel sad when I see you.

450
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:26,860
Who is it that I can't stop missing you?

451
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:31,860
Who is it that I can't stop missing you?

452
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,860
This song sounds so sad.

453
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,860
The one who hears it will cry.

454
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,860
Why is it that you are sweating?

455
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,860
The way you play the instrument is so fresh.

456
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,860
It's so touching.

457
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,860
suspenseful

458
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,460
Awesome!

459
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,420
I have nothing to say.

460
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,780
Nothing to say.

461
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,300
All you compliment might be tweeted.

462
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,300
This song, the song of the phoenix and the phoenix flower,

463
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,300
is very different from what I've heard before.

464
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,300
But did you write it?

465
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,300
When I was a student, I was moved by the melody of this song.

466
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,300
So I added my own feelings to this song in my future practice.

467
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,300
It made Mr. Min Ju laugh.

468
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,300
At a young age, you can play and play the score.

469
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,300
You are really young and promising.

470
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,300
This time it's stable.

471
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Jiang Li, you are so good.

472
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Great.

473
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
Although I've never heard the song you played,

474
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,300
I can't move my body when I hear it.

475
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,300
You are the only one who can play the phoenix.

476
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
Li Lian and the others will definitely have no chance.

477
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,300
They said they put the bet on Jiang Ruo Yao.

478
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,300
What?

479
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,300
I've been observing.

480
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Li Lian and the others don't care about their own team.

481
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,300
They care about Jiang Ruo Yao.

482
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,300
I think Li Lian and the others should know that

483
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,300
only Jiang Li has won over Jiang Ruo Yao.

484
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,300
Our score will surpass theirs.

485
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
In order not to get the first place,

486
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300
they'd rather help Jiang Ruo Yao.

487
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Who do you think they are?

488
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,300
Yan Ju is a musician.

489
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,300
It's impossible to win over him.

490
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Mr. Jin Hong is Jiang Ruo Yao's teacher.

491
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,300
He will definitely win.

492
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,300
Only the third place is left.

493
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Jiang Li's song is not about getting close to Li Hua Bai.

494
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,300
Whether it's technique,

495
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
artistic view or emotion,

496
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
it's worth the first place.

497
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,300
Everyone,

498
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,300
you think so too, right?

499
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,300
Although Jiang Li is full of emotions,

500
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,300
it's not that he's close to Li Hua Bai

501
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
and he doesn't have any grudges.

502
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Others may not be able to feel it.

503
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,300
It's better to let it out

504
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,300
and let it out clearly.

505
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,300
The heart of the Qin is like a human heart.

506
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,300
I think the latter

507
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,300
has a broader and broader meaning.

508
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,300
Good guy.

509
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,300
Good guy.

510
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,300
I only found out today

511
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,300
that the Qin heart is also a higher and lower part.

512
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
To be honest,

513
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,300
the way you said it

514
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,300
is nonsense.

515
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,300
Mr. Yan Ju,

516
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,300
since you asked me to comment,

517
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,300
I can't let you do it.

518
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,300
Everyone has their own way of commentating.

519
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,300
I won't go against your will.

520
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,300
You don't have to go against mine.

521
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
Fine.

522
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
I know you

523
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,300
are biased towards your own name.

524
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
But without you,

525
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,300
the result won't change.

526
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,300
Mr. Xiao, you're right.

527
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,300
I'll vote for

528
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,300
Jiang Ruo Yao.

529
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,300
What?

530
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,300
I'm deaf?

531
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,300
Mr. Xiao, you're also stupid.

532
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,300
Jiang Li and Jiang Ruo Yao

533
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
are both your students.

534
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,300
Did you take money from them?

535
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
Mr. Yan Ju, you're right.

536
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,300
Our Ming Yi Hall teaches the music

537
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,300
and the technique

538
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
to make students

539
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
play more.

540
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Jiang Li's music is really emotional.

541
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,300
But

542
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,300
the technique has a lower part.

543
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
Compared to Jiang Ruo Yao's music,

544
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,300
it's mature and stable.

545
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,300
It's obviously the result of long-term study and hard training.

546
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
Our Ming Yi Hall

547
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,300
encourages students to

548
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,300
study hard.

549
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
So,

550
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,300
I'll vote for Jiang Ruo Yao.

551
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,300
What you said

552
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,300
has solved my confusion.

553
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,300
I've been saying that

554
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,300
Ming Yi Hall has been in this business for years.

555
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,300
Why can't they make a great master?

556
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,300
You...

557
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,300
Duke Su, who will you vote for?

558
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,300
I'm not a musician.

559
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,300
I'm a listener.

560
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
I can't play the music.

561
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,300
I'm just thinking.

562
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,300
The music is

563
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,300
different from the music.

564
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Jiang Li's music

565
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,300
is all about the same.

566
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,300
The music is about love.

567
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,300
People will be betrayed and the end will be terrible.

568
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
I'll vote for this woman's love

569
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,300
and her hard training.

570
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
Although I've voted for this woman,

571
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
I wish the people of Qin

572
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,300
to have a good revenge

573
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,300
and to be honest.

574
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,300
Great.

575
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
Duke Su, you're really something.

576
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
You're finally a normal person.

577
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,300
Teacher Shen,

578
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,300
you're in charge of

579
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
their winning and losing.

580
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,300
I'm sorry.

581
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,300
I'm sorry.

582
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,300
You...

583
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,300
What are you doing?

584
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,300
Give it to me.

585
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Well...

586
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
You have done enough for me.

587
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,300
I couldn't even

588
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,300
save the love I got from you.

589
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,300
I, Shen Yu Rong,

590
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,300
will never meet anyone else again.

591
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,300
I can't stand

592
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,300
the result anymore.

593
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,900
You can still learn it after you sell it.

594
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,900
I'm a woman.

595
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,700
I'm just a concubine.

596
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,300
You have the talent of a goldsmith.

597
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,500
You can't be left behind.

598
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,300
You must be able to achieve your ambition.

599
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,500
Husband, you can't be stupid.

600
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,500
But you don't have to do this for me.

601
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,900
I really have my father-in-law's blessing.

602
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,700
When you're older and you play better,

603
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,900
you go to study first. I'll be back soon.

604
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,900
There is still a lot of work to be done.

605
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,500
I'm going to look for a good fit for both of you.

606
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Stop hesitating.

607
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,000
responsibility is to go my See room first

608
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,800
wary of you.

609
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,200
I'll just go and do that later.

610
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,400
Would there be another good fit?

611
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,900
If there are good women,

612
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,500
you may as well just spend some time

613
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,700
with them all these years.

614
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,100
It's kinda sad that there are so many people

615
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,100
I wouldn't find easily.

616
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,700
What would make them any happier?

617
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,200
How about someone to tickle the совершенно innocent eyes

618
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,640
was left alone in the mountain.

619
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,840
I buried her with my own hands.

620
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,760
She's dead.

621
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,720
She's dead!

622
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,160
The

623
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,600
The

624
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,120
You were so good just now.

625
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,640
They were all looking at you.

626
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,680
How could you be so good?

627
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,800
Lady Jia.

628
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,600
Congratulations on winning the love.

629
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
I thought that Mr. Zhou

630
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,520
should be with Third Sister.

631
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,640
Lady Jia, you don't have to

632
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,320
push me to your Third Sister.

633
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,480
We made the engagement.

634
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,600
But you and I...

635
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,640
Zhou Yanbang.

636
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,240
Stop talking about your nonsense.

637
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,080
Don't make a scene when you have the engagement.

638
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,200
You should know the engagement

639
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,400
the best.

640
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,240
Actually, as long as you want,

641
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,000
I can persuade my mother

642
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,200
to change the engagement

643
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,920
back.

644
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,520
Who do you think you are?

645
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,040
Liu Xun.

646
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,000
I...

647
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,160
I don't want to.

648
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,000
You're so good.

649
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,960
Look.

650
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,600
The engagement is coming.

651
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,040
The engagement is coming.

652
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,080
What happened?

653
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,440
What happened?

654
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,560
What happened?

655
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,920
What happened?

656
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,840
What happened?

657
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,040
What happened to the engagement?

658
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,320
It's the engagement.

659
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,680
My money!

660
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,080
My money!

661
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,520
Are you not happy?

662
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,040
What did you say?

663
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,800
What did you say?

664
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,400
What did you say?

665
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
The second wife of the Jiang family

666
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,200
was sent away when she was young.

667
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,800
She was in Zhennv Hall for ten years.

668
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,440
During these ten years,

669
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,600
she was silent.

670
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,000
But after the battle,

671
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,040
the second wife of the Jiang family

672
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,640
became famous.

673
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,480
She became famous.

674
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,240
It's a great thing.

675
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,080
Congratulations, Prime Minister Jiang.

676
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,840
It's great that you're a good daughter.

677
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,080
We're so envious.

678
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,920
Yes, we're so envious.

679
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,880
Prime Minister Li.

680
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,360
The victory and defeat are common in the military.

681
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,120
We know it well.

682
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,080
The engagement is just a trick of the kids.

683
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,920
Li Lian is your son-in-law.

684
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,880
I think we should forget about the marriage.

685
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,840
Jiang Yuanbai.

686
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,240
Don't give me a place to play.

687
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,360
Then go.

688
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,720
Which temple?

689
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,240
Don't forget to

690
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,000
tell me the news at my home.

691
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,400
The kids will also be offered a monk's room.

692
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,640
Then we can go to the incense.

693
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,240
Before going to the incense,

694
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,840
don't forget to go home

695
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,000
and watch the two daughters of Prime Minister Jiang.

696
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Don't fight.

697
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,800
Everyone,

698
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,400
wait and see.

699
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,160
Two women are fighting.

700
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,600
How beautiful it is.

701
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,720
Prime Minister Li,

702
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,760
which temple?

703
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,600
When the time comes,

704
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,160
don't forget to tell me.

705
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Why did you frame me?

706
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,240
Third Miss.

707
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,360
Third Miss.

708
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,440
Third Miss, open the door.

709
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,720
Third Miss.

710
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,760
What's going on?

711
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
Everyone in the house knows

712
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,720
that such a big thing happened.

713
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,240
It's okay to lose the competition.

714
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,760
But you can't lose the dignity.

715
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,680
Third Miss locked herself in the house.

716
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,600
I can't persuade her.

717
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,040
If we lose the competition,

718
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,080
it's not a big deal.

719
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,080
It's okay to lose the competition.

720
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,480
But there are rumors everywhere

721
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,360
that Mr. Zhou

722
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,040
is going to break the engagement

723
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,560
with our wife.

724
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,400
Go.

725
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:20,960
Hurry.

726
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,000
Yes.

727
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,960
Where did it come from?

728
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,000
The ladies outside

729
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,040
have spread the rumors.

730
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,400
They said after the situation,

731
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,320
Mr. Zhou took the initiative to find Jiang Li.

732
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,000
He wants to change the engagement with her.

733
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,040
Ridiculous.

734
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,640
How can the engagement be changed?

735
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,920
You don't talk about her.

736
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,920
She's not stable at all.

737
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Because there are rumors outside.

738
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
She's like this when she comes home.

739
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,280
How ridiculous.

740
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,560
She's learned the zither for so many years.

741
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
How can she lose to the wild girl in the Zhen Nv Hall?

742
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,960
No.

743
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,800
She's been in the Zhen Nv Hall for so many years.

744
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,960
She can only practice the characters.

745
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,920
How can those Zhen Nv girls let her practice the zither?

746
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,240
And she can play a good zither.

747
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,520
It's really strange.

748
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,720
Ask around.

749
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,320
Where is the Zhen Nv Hall owner

750
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,520
who was caught and taken away?

751
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,800
Do you want to know

752
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,480
who Jiang Li learned the zither from?

753
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,160
Since she came back,

754
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
I've been feeling something wrong.

755
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,040
Maybe

756
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,520
she's not Jiang Li at all.

757
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,020
Li Uncle

758
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:10,720
Holding hands, can we cross the snow?

759
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:18,720
In the cold wind, in the long night

760
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,720
Embracing the remaining warmth

761
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:40,720
Holding hands, can we cross the night?

762
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:47,720
Love is to cherish with life

763
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:55,720
To live on, even if it's a little hurt

764
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:03,720
No matter sorrow or joy, I believe you

765
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:10,720
I'd rather be trapped in the coldness of the world

766
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,720
Live on, use up all your courage

767
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:25,720
Love on, until you breathe

768
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:33,720
Through the cruelty of the world, just for you

769
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:39,720
After we get together, we won't be apart

770
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:49,720
After we get together, we won't be apart
