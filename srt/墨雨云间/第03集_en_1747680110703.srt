00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sister.

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Tong'er.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why are you here?

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why are you here?

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The person who picked me up said that

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Duke Su asked me to take care of you.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Sister, how are you?

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Did Duke Su make it hard for you?

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm fine.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Everything is fine.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Sister, when I just came here,

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I heard people outside saying that

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
the Jiang family is going to welcome the second wife.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Can we go home now?

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Tong'er.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There is one thing I want to tell you.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't deal with those people

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
who killed Jiang Li for now.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't know if Lin'er will hate me

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
if she knows it.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The people who killed your wife

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
are those who are so angry with the Jiang family.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
After we go back to the Jiang family,

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
it's like entering the Long Tan Lake.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If we are found out on the behalf of Jiang Li,

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
we will be in a difficult situation.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Tong'er.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You have suffered enough

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
in the Zhen Nv Hall for so many years.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now is the chance.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You can stay with me.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You can have your own way

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to go wherever you want.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You don't need to risk going back with me.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Tong'er.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Sister.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If Mrs. Ye didn't take me as her maid,

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I would have been sold to the brothel.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I swore to protect my wife.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But I have broken my promise.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If I don't do anything,

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I will be ashamed to see you in the future.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
As long as I can make you happy,

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
you will be my master.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I will follow you forever.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can do anything.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
From now on,

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
we will have enough difficulties.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Madam.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Are you really going to take her back?

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
She has finally been sent out.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If you take her back,

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
won't it be...

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What do you know?

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Although His Majesty didn't say it,

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
in his heart,

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
it's like giving a decree.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Jiang Li must be taken back.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's okay to take her back.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What does Duke Su mean?

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He wants to win her with the seal of Duke Su's Mansion.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Isn't that to help him?

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
These clothes are all good materials.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
When you go to pick up Jiang Li tomorrow,

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
bring it to him.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's like this.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We even sent such good clothes to him.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Isn't that too much for him?

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's not easy to be evil in the future.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The carriage of the Jiang family,

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
the seal of Duke Su's Mansion,

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
are all very important.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Shouldn't we help him

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
to be more important?

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's better to be broken.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Break?

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
There's something I'm a little worried about.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Duke Su's meddling in this matter

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
may be an accident.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But Mrs. Liu is not a fool.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The matter of Zhen Nv Tang

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
can be announced by the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Revenue

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
to the court.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's not a coincidence.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If you know that the Mrs. Liu

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
has a relationship with Ye Zhen Zhen,

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and can make it happen,

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
only Jiang Li can.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
These years,

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
the old lady always has that girl in her heart.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She always thinks about her.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If she is really a person with a secret mind,

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and goes home and gets the love of the old lady,

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
it will be difficult to do.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I will remember.

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Mrs. Su.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You are...

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Jiang Li.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You are Jiang Li.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I am.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I am.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I am.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You are.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You are Jiang Li?

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm afraid you haven't seen me for so many years.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You can't recognize me.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's just that I haven't seen you for a long time.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And I heard that Zhen Nv Tang's master was arrested.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm worried that I always play the role of a wedding flower.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I have to look carefully, right?

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This.

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This is my mother's hairpin.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Mrs. Su, look carefully.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I think that Mrs. Su is not only a wedding flower,

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
but also has a short memory.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If mother and father don't want to take me back,

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
then it's okay.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Please wait.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's all my fault.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Please forgive me.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This lady sees you live in Zhen Nv Tang for a long time.

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
She also misses you.

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
She has been talking to the master.

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She said she wanted to take you home.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But the master finally agreed a while ago.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
She sent someone to clean up.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
She also sent me to take you home.

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If she sees you,

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
she will be so happy.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Thank you for your concern.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I have been thinking about my mother all the time in Zhen Nv Tang.

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm always by her side.

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm always confused.

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Now I'm finally going home.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I will remember my mother's kindness.

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I will be filial to her every day.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Good.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come on.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Look.

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is what our lady sent me to buy you some new clothes.

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm afraid you won't feel comfortable in these old clothes.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Look.

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
These are all good clothes.

151
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I think you should change it now.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You look so grand when you go home.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This will show your identity.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Thank you, Mrs. Sun.

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Tong.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Please, my lady.

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The End

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
As you said,

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Mrs. Jiang loves Jiang Li the most.

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Ji Shuran should know

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that she will be our only support.

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm afraid she won't let us get close to her so easily.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Tong.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Do you know what chance she has?

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I remember that Mr. Jiang

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
once treated a girl from Yi Qing House as his concubine.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That girl was elegant,

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
liked to wear beautiful clothes,

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and liked to count the money.

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
She was very rich.

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I wonder how much money she lost.

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Mrs. Jiang hates her.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Duke Su

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
caught me

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
without knowing the truth.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You really don't take me

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
as your father.

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You are so self-righteous.

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm a courtier.

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm a courtier.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
If I'm guilty,

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
it's up to you.

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
If I'm not,

184
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can also

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
clean up Mr. Qin's name.

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can't tell the difference between the good and the bad.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You said it too early.

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Then

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
give Duke Su a few more days.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If you can't find the evidence

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and don't release him,

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
even if you have to take advantage of me

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
to make a confession,

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and a life,

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
you have to seek justice.

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't believe

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
that His Majesty is a filial man.

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He can't understand my

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
heart.

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm not sending you off.

201
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Mr. Qin still refuses to confess.

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Should I punish him severely?

203
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mr. Qin has such an old man as a support.

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Of course he refuses to confess.

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Are you worried that I can't do it?

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Or are you worried that

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
the old man will report to His Majesty?

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Are you afraid of

209
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
people making trouble in this field?

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You are so reckless.

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's all because of that second lady.

212
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I thought I could

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
get the fish out of the fish

214
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
but now it's stuck here.

215
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I really didn't go.

216
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Look closely.

217
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He only shows this side.

218
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There is nothing else.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There are some important things in my brother's bag.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't use this to threaten me.

221
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
See?

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's weird though.

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The money is not enough.

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Look at this.

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The house is full of coins.

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I didn't even know about this.

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It was just mentioned in the cross,

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
but the coins are still in his bag.

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,200
Isn't it great?

230
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,680
Look

231
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,560
I didn't expect that

232
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,720
the flowers would bloom so early

233
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,400
Yeah

234
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,480
You want all these?

235
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,760
Let's go to another village to see

236
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,220
The

237
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,000
The

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The

240
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The

242
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The

243
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The

244
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The

246
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The

247
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The

248
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Master

251
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's interesting to see the Second Lady

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
She played with us all the way

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to go back to the Jiang family

254
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But today she got on the Jiang family's carriage

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and she doesn't know the Master

256
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What does it mean?

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The military is at the bottom of the five

258
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You want to hit me again?

259
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If she really is Jiang Li

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll just take this half-bath as a gift

261
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What do you mean?

262
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
She is suspicious

263
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and involves important officials in the court

264
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I have to think about it

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You said

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
she is not a person

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
but a person who is not a person

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why?

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Because she is not a person

270
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
but a person who is not a person

271
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Why?

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I never believe in coincidences

273
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Whether it's looks

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
or others

275
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But now she is back to the Jiang family

276
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It will be difficult to interrogate her again

277
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You don't have to interrogate her

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Let her go back

279
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and see what she wants to do

280
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Keep an eye on her

281
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What are you doing?

283
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Madam told me yesterday

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
that I should prepare a gift for her

285
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
even though I haven't seen her for ten years

286
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Now Duke Su

287
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
is going to send her off with his will

288
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
If I don't prepare it well

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
the whole city will be in danger

290
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm afraid

291
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I can't do it

292
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm afraid

293
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I can't do it

294
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm afraid

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The whole city will be in danger

296
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The whole city will be in danger

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Madam

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This is a gift from His Majesty

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What do you think?

300
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You like the precious jade

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
but Li is just a child

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
How can you know this?

303
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What about the calligraphy?

304
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The family name is hard to find

305
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The family name is hard to find

306
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The family name is hard to find

307
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You forgot

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Li has been studying in Zhenyu Hall since he was a child

309
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You will make him sad if you send him these

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Have a rest

311
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Have a rest

312
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm sorry

313
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I've arranged it

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I've sent the clothes there

315
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They are all good materials

316
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I didn't give them to you if you like them

317
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Li is back in a bright and bright way

318
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
He is so considerate

319
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
No one dares to say that our family is harsh on him

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Thank you, madam

321
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'll go to change the clothes

322
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Still not here?

323
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes, I haven't seen her for so many years

324
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I wonder what does the second madam of the Jiang family look like

325
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
She is a wild girl who has been living in the mountains all the time

326
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
How beautiful she is

327
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yes

328
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Welcome the second madam back

329
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
She is back

330
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Zou Yue

331
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Welcome back

332
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
She is the second madam

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
See, I told you

334
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The second madam is so vulgar

335
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes

336
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Why do you say no?

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The Jiang family is like a rich family

338
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They are so popular with their daughter

339
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This is Li

340
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Li

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
As long as you apologize to your mother

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You don't have to go back to the mountains

343
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Li is not wrong

344
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Li is back

345
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Li, father, mother

346
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Get up

347
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Li, why are you wearing the clothes of the real daughter?

348
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Didn't you bring Li new clothes?

349
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Mrs. Sun, didn't I ask you to send new clothes?

350
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I sent clothes to the madam this morning

351
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But when I heard that it was a gift from the madam

352
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't think she likes it

353
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Li, this is your mother's mind

354
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Why don't you wear it?

355
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Maybe I don't like the clothes I sent

356
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But I'll go out and let Li choose it by himself

357
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Mother

358
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The clothes you sent to Li are the best of the best

359
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Li is happy and grateful

360
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But

361
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But what?

362
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But maybe it's been too long

363
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Mother has never been to the real daughter's hall to see Li

364
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I don't know the clothes Li sent now are not suitable

365
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What are you doing?

366
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Master, it's all my fault

367
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's not your fault

368
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Actually, the madam has told me to ask about the size of the second lady

369
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I didn't do my job well

370
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Please punish me

371
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Don't be angry, husband

372
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Maybe I'm too happy to do it

373
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Li, go in first

374
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't let uncle and aunt wait for a long time

375
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Li, go in first

376
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Li, see your aunt

377
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Uncle

378
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Aunt

379
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Uncle, Jiang Yuanping

380
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He is tall and looks like a good man

381
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
He is the brother of Jiang Yuanbai's enemy

382
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Madam, Lu Shi, is the daughter of the City Guards

383
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Jiang Yuanping is the famous wife

384
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Lu Shi was sick in the hospital

385
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
He had a headache

386
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He is very self-contained

387
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's good that you are back

388
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't know what you like

389
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This jade bead is for you

390
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Thank you, aunt

391
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Aunt

392
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Do you feel better after having a headache these years?

393
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't feel much pain now

394
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Your uncle found me many doctors

395
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm almost recovered

396
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Li is really considerate

397
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Li is always very sensible

398
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
When I was a kid, I hugged him often

399
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
He didn't cry or make a fuss

400
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
He was so proud of himself

401
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He didn't cry or make a fuss

402
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
He was so proud of himself

403
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Uncle

404
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Aunt

405
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I prepared a pair of earring for you

406
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Jiang Yuanxing is very handsome

407
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He is a concubine's son

408
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
He is not valued in the Jiang family

409
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
He is a fisherman

410
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yang Shi is the daughter of the Xuande Lang family

411
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
If he is not married at a young age

412
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
He will not marry Jiang Yuanxing

413
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
He will not marry Jiang Yuanxing

414
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Do you like it?

415
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Thank you, aunt

416
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Uncle

417
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Do you like fishing?

418
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
When I go out to cut firewood

419
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I see the fish in the water of the Qingcheng Mountain

420
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's very fresh

421
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And the scenery is good

422
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I haven't fished for a long time

423
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Li is a thoughtful child

424
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yes

425
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
He has been thinking about his family for so many years

426
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Brother

427
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We are all crowded today

428
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
How about we have a reunion dinner tonight

429
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And invite the old lady over

430
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
OK

431
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Li has just come back

432
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
He has been tired all the way

433
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's not too late to meet him tomorrow

434
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Please forgive me

435
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I am so tired

436
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
OK

437
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Great

438
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Li

439
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Am I right?

440
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I will do as you say

441
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Li has grown up

442
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
He is much more sensible

443
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You are thoughtful

444
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Li

445
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Let me take you to the backyard

446
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
OK

447
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Let's go

448
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
How hard it would be to have a reunion dinner

449
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Li, have a good rest later

450
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
If you need anything

451
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Just tell me

452
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Li

453
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Li

454
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
What's wrong?

455
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I haven't been back for a long time

456
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The changes in the family have been so fast

457
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I don't remember

458
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
We have cleaned up the yard

459
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Over the years

460
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Let's go

461
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I will show you around

462
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Do you remember this place?

463
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's changed

464
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Father

465
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Look

466
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I remember

467
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I cried a lot on the fake mountain

468
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I want my mother

469
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Mother

470
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Mother

471
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Mother

472
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Li

473
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Don't be afraid

474
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I am here to pick you up

475
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Then father said something

476
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I jumped down from the mountain

477
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I forgot what I said

478
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You said

479
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Don't worry

480
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I will never let Li get hurt

481
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I didn't expect that

482
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Li still remembers

483
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
what happened when he was a kid

484
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I remember

485
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Our family used to

486
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
like to sit in the yard

487
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and watch the play

488
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
in that position

489
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yes

490
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yes

491
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You are still in good health

492
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I love Li the most

493
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I am unfilial

494
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I can't be with you and father

495
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I love you

496
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I won't blame you

497
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I did something wrong

498
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
If father didn't send me to Zhennv Hall

499
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I can't regret it

500
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I am not confident

501
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Don't mention the past

502
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Li has grown up

503
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
He can see the future

504
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I wonder if grandmother

505
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
is still angry with me

506
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You are kind-hearted

507
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Why would she blame you?

508
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You just want to visit her

509
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Why do you mention the past

510
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
to hurt yourself?

511
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I am so sorry

512
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
for being a mother

513
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I was worried that

514
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
you would be tired

515
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and you would be too weak

516
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Since you are in a hurry

517
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I will go with you

518
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Mother

519
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Li is back

520
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You are back

521
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Madam was nice to you

522
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
She was cold

523
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and coughed every winter

524
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
After she heard it

525
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
she would make you a soup

526
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Greetings, grandmother

527
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Let me have a look

528
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Li

529
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Li

530
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yes, mother

531
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
My child

532
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You have suffered a lot

533
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I am afraid that I can't leave

534
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
for the rest of my life

535
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I can only send you

536
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
some things during the New Year's Day

537
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But you have only

538
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
one child

539
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and you are still

540
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
a child without a right to account

541
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I don't know

542
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
how she will

543
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
help you with the things

544
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
that I have sent to you

545
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
If you really care about

546
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Jiang Li

547
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
have you received

548
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
the things that I have sent

549
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
over the past ten years?

550
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Not necessarily

551
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Maybe I have sent them

552
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
but someone stopped me

553
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I am very happy

554
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
to have grandmother's care

555
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I have been living well

556
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I can't see grandmother

557
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and I can't serve her

558
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I am very regretful

559
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
When I come back home

560
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I won't say such things

561
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
In the future

562
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
if you need anything

563
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
or want to eat something

564
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
just tell me

565
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Thank you, grandmother

566
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Mrs. Zhang

567
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
go and make a bowl of pear soup for Li

568
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I remember that when he was a child

569
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
he loved this the most

570
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yes

571
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Li, come

572
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Come

573
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Come

574
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Sit down

575
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Put it on

576
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
No, grandmother

577
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This is too expensive

578
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Take it

579
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Come

580
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Grandmother

581
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I owe you so much

582
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I will make up for it

583
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Li

584
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Thank you, grandmother

585
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
This little hand is so beautiful

586
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The face is also beautiful

587
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
He didn't look like this before

588
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
He is totally different

589
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Little red boy

590
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Grandmother, I want to play

591
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Little Bingsi

592
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
This is

593
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You are the bad guy

594
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
who killed my mother and brother

595
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I hit you

596
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You are a bad guy

597
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Bingsi

598
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Bingsi

599
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Shut up

600
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Bingsi

601
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Why did you bring Bingsi here?

602
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
This little boy just woke up

603
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and he was making noise

604
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to find his mother

605
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I can't stop him

606
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
When did mother

607
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
give birth to such a cute place?

608
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Sister, you are so beautiful

609
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Mother

610
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Who is your brother?

611
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
The murderer killed my brother

612
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Bingsi

613
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
What are you talking about?

614
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I don't want to be beautiful

615
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Sister is here

616
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Little red boy

617
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I don't want her here

618
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Get up

619
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Get up

620
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I don't want her here

621
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Grandmother, I don't want her here

622
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Grandmother, I don't want to be beautiful

623
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Sister is here

624
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Bingsi

625
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Stand up

626
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Such a little boy

627
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
What's going on?

628
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You don't teach him

629
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and you can't say such words

630
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
What madam taught me

631
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
is that I have been busy

632
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
with the matter of Li'er coming back

633
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I have neglected

634
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Bingsi's education

635
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's all my fault

636
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I don't know if the young master

637
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
heard the servant

638
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
talking nonsense down there

639
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Madam, if you want to punish me

640
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
you can punish me

641
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Bingsi is still young

642
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You can give him more education

643
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Today is the day Li'er comes back

644
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Don't punish the servant

645
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The second girl is back

646
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It's so decent outside

647
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's so noisy inside

648
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What does it look like?

649
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
My words may be a little heavy

650
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
But I'm still pointing at the child

651
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I just want to remind you

652
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Whether it's big or small

653
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
you have to be careful with your education

654
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Don't be addicted to evil

655
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So that you don't waste

656
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
the blood of the whole family

657
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
and the whole family

658
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You are right

659
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Forget it

660
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Let's go

661
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Okay, I won't let you rest

662
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Madam Sun

663
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Take Li'er back to rest

664
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Yes, master

665
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
This is the yard of the second girl

666
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Fangfeiyuan

667
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's really heaven

668
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
This is the yard

669
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
where the second girl lived before

670
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The second girl lives here

671
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
and the second girl lives here

672
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You can't go to the yard

673
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You can't go to the yard

674
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You can't go to the yard

675
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You can't go to the yard

676
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
This is the yard

677
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
where the second girl lived before

678
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Do you remember it?

679
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Although it looks a little broken now

680
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
the second girl hasn't come back

681
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
all these years

682
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
We don't dare to move, do we?

683
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I think it's good to clean up

684
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The second girl came back suddenly

685
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The time is tight

686
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
The servants don't have time

687
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
to clean up

688
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I think we should bother

689
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
the second girl to clean up

690
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
herself

691
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It's not good to do that

692
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
to her

693
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Come and have a look

694
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
How is it?

695
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Are you satisfied?

696
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
If you're really not satisfied

697
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I'll report to Madam

698
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and change a big yard for you

699
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Madam Sun

700
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Although this yard looks broken

701
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and messy

702
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
it's good to clean it up

703
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'll leave now

704
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
OK

705
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Madam, we just arrived here

706
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and they just cleaned up this yard

707
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
We can go to report to the master

708
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and take the responsibility

709
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
of taking care of Madam Sun

710
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
If you don't like it, you can change the yard

711
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
If we don't change it

712
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and we have to take the responsibility

713
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
it's unreasonable

714
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
What if we change it?

715
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Then we'll be charged

716
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
with being picky

717
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
when we come back

718
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I think so

719
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Then that Jiang Bingji

720
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
must be asked by Ji Shuran

721
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
to take her there

722
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm still thinking

723
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
why he's so kind

724
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
to let you see Madam

725
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I didn't expect he would wait here

726
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Madam

727
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
is sincere to Jiang Li

728
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But just now Madam

729
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
didn't help Madam to talk

730
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Now this yard

731
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,480
is just a

732
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
and there are others behind

733
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,480
I was sick when I was a kid

734
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,480
It's me taken care of by Madam and Madam

735
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
They don't care about

736
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
what I do

737
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
until I get better

738
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Madam and Madam are really good people

739
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
But after Madam left

740
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,960
Madam was misled by them

741
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
and she will never be able to pay back

742
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,960
what she owed to Madam

743
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Tong'er

744
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
I will get back

745
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
everything Jiang Li should get back

746
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
Madam

747
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
I've sent Jiang Li

748
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
to the police station

749
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
and I've sent her back

750
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
to the police station

751
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
I've sent her back

752
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
to the police station

753
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
I've sent Jiang Li

754
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
to the police station

755
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Is there anything strange?

756
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
Since we took her back from the Mansion of Duke

757
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
she started to trick us

758
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
She's been acting like a fool

759
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
and pretending to be a good girl

760
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
If Madam didn't prepare for it

761
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
we would have lost the first round

762
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
She's thoughtful

763
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Madam asked her if she received the things

764
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
She didn't open it

765
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
She's well-educated

766
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,440
What's wrong?

767
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Madam

768
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Do you think that Jiang Li

769
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,440
is much worse

770
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,440
than ten years ago?

771
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
Are you talking about her temperament

772
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
or her appearance?

773
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
She was still young

774
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,440
when she left the Mansion of Duke

775
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,440
She looked a bit like her

776
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,440
But her temperament

777
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,440
is like a different person

778
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,440
Shen Yan

779
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
Shen Yan

780
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,920
You can't

781
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,920
say such things

782
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
in front of your husband and Madam

783
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
If it's spread

784
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
outsiders will say that

785
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,920
I'm a mother

786
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
and I don't want to

787
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
be the daughter of the Jiang family

788
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Since she dared to come back

789
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
she must have been well prepared

790
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,920
If she really left

791
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
she should know

792
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
who is in charge of this family

793
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
If it's Jiang Li

794
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
under my nose

795
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
she will reveal

796
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,920
her fox tail sooner or later

797
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
Then

798
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
she will know

799
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,920
what medicine she sells

800
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
Tomorrow

801
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,920
send two maids to give her a hand

802
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Remember

803
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,920
to serve her well

804
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Maid

805
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
Maid

806
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Maid

807
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
This is Xiangqiao, Yun Shuang

808
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Maid

809
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Xiangqiao

810
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,920
What are you talking about?

811
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Smart

812
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Smart

813
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Good girl

814
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
Good girl

815
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Good good good

816
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Yun Shuang

817
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Say it yourself

818
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Be kind

819
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Kind

820
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Be patient

821
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Be patient

822
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Good good good

823
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
You are so beautiful

824
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Yes, beautiful

825
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
They

826
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
usually serve

827
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
Madam

828
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
When Madam sees you

829
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
she only has one servant

830
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
to serve you

831
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
It's so jealous

832
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
She asked me

833
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
to send two maids

834
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
to serve you

835
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
Thank you, Mother

836
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
for your kindness

837
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Look, second son

838
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
This is a new dress

839
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
made by Madam

840
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
New jewelry

841
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
And the monthly salary this month

842
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Keep it

843
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Thank you, Mother

844
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
Put it behind

845
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Xiangqiao

846
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
Yun Shuang

847
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
Serve the second lady well

848
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
Use it well

849
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
I'll leave first

850
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,360
Okay

851
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,360
Xiangqiao

852
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Go wash this teacup

853
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
Okay

854
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
I'm scared

855
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
What should I do?

856
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
It's broken

857
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,360
How can you break a teacup?

858
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
My hands

859
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,360
are rough and thick

860
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
It seems that it is only suitable for doing some rough work

861
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
This delicate work

862
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
I have to get used to it

863
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,840
So you said

864
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,840
your hands are rough and thick

865
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,840
But is this work delicate?

866
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
You can't do this

867
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
I said this work is rough

868
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
It is rough

869
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Rough work

870
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
is rough work

871
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
Rough

872
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Tong'er

873
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Xiangqiao is rough and thick

874
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,840
He can only do rough work

875
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
In the future

876
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
you will do such delicate work

877
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,840
You do it

878
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,840
Then you will clean the floor

879
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
This cup is broken

880
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
I have to go to the warehouse

881
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,440
to buy a new set of

882
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
Why is this man like this?

883
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
He is obviously bullying people

884
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,440
There will be more things like this in the future

885
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,440
Yun Shuang

886
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
Go get some fertilizer

887
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,440
No

888
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
You haven't asked yet

889
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
How do you know it's not there?

890
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
No

891
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,440
This fertilizer is not something that can be found easily

892
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Whoever eats it first

893
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
will know that we are going to use fertilizer today

894
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,440
They don't have to invite people in first

895
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,440
to do it

896
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Write a list

897
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,440
Right?

898
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
Then invite people to buy it

899
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
Then go invite

900
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,440
Now?

901
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
I can't go

902
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
Those butlers

903
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Yang Zi is definitely not there now

904
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,440
Then I'm going in a hurry

905
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
I can't be beaten for 50 big bowls

906
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,440
No

907
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
You haven't asked yet

908
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
How do you know it's not there?

909
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Forget it

910
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,440
Tong'er

911
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,440
You can go and ask

912
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Okay

913
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
My stomach hurts

914
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
I'm going to the toilet

915
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
This is sweet, try it

916
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
Sweet?

917
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
It's really sweet

918
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
I want to see if you two

919
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,440
can sit there all the time

920
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,440
Why not?

921
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,440
The second lady said

922
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
as long as we are tired

923
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,440
we can rest anytime

924
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
Are you tired?

925
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,440
I'm so tired

926
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,440
What about you?

927
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,440
I'm tired too

928
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
Come on, try one

929
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
Don't worry

930
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
Anyway, the lotus in these two bowls

931
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,440
I will never wash or touch it

932
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,440
I have to show the Jiang family

933
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,440
how you two are a maid

934
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
Let me

935
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,440
How can you do this kind of work?

936
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
I've been working for a long time

937
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,440
I'm not tired

938
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,440
She didn't cry or make a fuss

939
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,440
She's so obedient

940
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
I also think it's strange

941
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,440
She even asked those two maids

942
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,440
to be more overbearing

943
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
I didn't expect the second lady

944
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,440
to be so obedient

945
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
Madam

946
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,440
Do you think we should

947
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
push her harder?

948
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,440
No need

949
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,440
Just keep an eye on her

950
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,440
If you see anything

951
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
just tell me

952
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,440
If you want to encourage her

953
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,440
I don't want to

954
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,440
think about her

955
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,440
If she's more sensible

956
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,440
I can tolerate her

957
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
If she's not sensible

958
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
Sister

959
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,440
Look at them

960
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,440
They are so naughty

961
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
Sister

962
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
You are the second lady of the Jiang family

963
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,440
You can totally

964
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
control them

965
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,440
Finished?

966
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
And

967
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,440
Why do they

968
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
always

969
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,440
look for trouble

970
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
and make me

971
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
clean up the mess?

972
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,440
Are you angry?

973
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,440
Of course

974
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,440
I just think

975
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,440
they just got here

976
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,440
and they are already on us

977
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,440
What should we do?

978
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,440
When I came back home

979
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
I was so angry

980
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,440
with my servants

981
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,440
I even made them

982
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,440
cry

983
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,440
I even told Madam

984
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,440
and Jiang Yun

985
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,440
what kind of person I am

986
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,440
You mean

987
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Think about it

988
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,440
These two maids

989
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
were good at

990
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
being at home

991
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,440
Why did they

992
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,440
make mistakes

993
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
when they came to my Fangfei house?

994
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,440
I was just being domineering

995
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,440
But once I heard

996
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,440
the domineering sound

997
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,440
on my head

998
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,440
Li'er had been

999
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,440
suffering in the mountains for ten years

1000
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,440
The guilt

1001
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,440
she had in Jiang Yun

1002
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,440
was completely

1003
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,440
wiped out

1004
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,440
by her skills

1005
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
Sister

1006
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,440
We can't

1007
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,440
just let them suffer

1008
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,440
I was pretending to be patient

1009
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,440
and I was sure that I would make mistakes

1010
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,440
But you were so sincere

1011
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,440
and made them

1012
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,440
look down on us

1013
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,440
Sister

1014
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,440
Do you have

1015
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,440
a way to deal with them now?

1016
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,440
I have already

1017
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,440
realized that

1018
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,440
I have already

1019
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,440
realized their nature

1020
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,440
We have given them a chance

1021
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,440
Be careful

1022
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,440
Let's go

1023
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,440
Be careful

1024
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,440
Where to put it?

1025
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,440
Here

1026
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,440
Okay

1027
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,440
Be careful

1028
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
Be careful

1029
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,440
Come

1030
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,440
Go forward

1031
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,440
Right here

1032
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,440
Be careful

1033
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,440
I'll go first

1034
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
Be careful

1035
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,440
This is the seat for the god

1036
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,440
Master

1037
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,440
These are all

1038
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,440
the arrangements of Madam

1039
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,440
Isn't this

1040
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,440
the ceremony of the third lady?

1041
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,440
Madam

1042
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,440
I have seen the whole

1043
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,440
house

1044
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,440
arranged all along

1045
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,440
I have seen the whole house

1046
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,440
Madam, you have worked hard

1047
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,440
It's all my duty

1048
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,440
This is the guest list

1049
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,440
of the ceremony

1050
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,440
Please have a look

1051
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,440
Madam, please arrange it

1052
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,440
What's wrong?

1053
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,440
This is a big event

1054
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,440
The Marquis of Ningyuan

1055
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,440
can't be left alone

1056
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,440
I'm not worried about you

1057
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,440
I don't want to

1058
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,440
have any problems with the Marquis

1059
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,440
Li'er is our child

1060
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,440
We will meet sooner or later

1061
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,440
I'm afraid that she will be uncomfortable

1062
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,440
That year

1063
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,440
she and the Marquis

1064
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,440
Zhou Yanbang

1065
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,440
made a engagement

1066
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,440
Although she made a mistake

1067
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,440
We discussed with the Marquis

1068
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
and changed Ruoyao

1069
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,440
But if Li'er sees

1070
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,440
Ruoyao and Yanbang together

1071
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
I'm afraid that she will be uncomfortable

1072
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,440
Moreover

1073
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,440
our family is not small

1074
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,440
Ruoyao has a lot of

1075
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,440
officials under her

1076
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,440
If Li'er

1077
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
is like the old madam

1078
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,440
who met her that day

1079
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,440
and made a mistake

1080
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,440
it will be bad for her

1081
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,440
You are right

1082
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,440
If she is not well-treated

1083
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,440
and is criticized by others

1084
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
we won't let Li'er

1085
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,440
participate in the ceremony

1086
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,440
Let her get used to

1087
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,440
the life in the capital

1088
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,440
We will find a chance to meet

1089
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,440
It's up to you

1090
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,440
You have worked hard recently

1091
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,440
Let me massage you

1092
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,440
Xiangqiao

1093
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,440
Come on

1094
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,440
I only asked Xiangqiao

1095
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,440
to go alone

1096
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,440
Go ahead

1097
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,440
It's okay

1098
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,440
Xiangqiao

1099
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,440
Sit down

1100
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,440
Tong'er

1101
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,440
I'm sorry

1102
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,440
I'm sorry

1103
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,440
I'm sorry

1104
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,440
Serve tea

1105
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,440
Madam

1106
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
You are so kind

1107
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,440
Just tell me

1108
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,440
what's wrong

1109
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,440
I've already

1110
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,440
taught Tong'er a lesson

1111
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,440
He grew up with me

1112
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,440
in Zhennv Hall

1113
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
He doesn't know the rules

1114
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,440
and is not good at handling people

1115
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,440
He is a straightforward person

1116
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,440
Don't mind him

1117
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,440
You are right

1118
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,440
But

1119
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,440
I just want to

1120
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,440
serve my wife

1121
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,440
We have been in Zhennv Hall

1122
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,440
for so many years

1123
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,440
When we just came back

1124
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,440
we don't understand

1125
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,440
the rules of the house

1126
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,440
I hope

1127
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,440
you can help us

1128
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,440
Well

1129
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,440
Madam

1130
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,440
This is what my mother

1131
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,440
gave me when I came back

1132
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,440
I don't need it

1133
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,440
in my daily life

1134
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,440
I wonder if you

1135
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,440
like it

1136
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,440
Well

1137
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,440
If you like it

1138
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,440
just take it

1139
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,440
Thank you

1140
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,440
I have something

1141
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,440
to ask you

1142
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,440
What's the matter?

1143
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,440
I saw

1144
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,440
some servants

1145
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,440
moving some pots and pans

1146
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,440
It's so lively

1147
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,440
We are going to have a guest in the house

1148
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,440
It will be your wedding ceremony

1149
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,440
in the house

1150
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,440
It's being held now

1151
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,440
I see

1152
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,440
Give me some more

1153
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,440
Here you are

1154
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,440
I don't want to

1155
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,440
visit my grandmother these days

1156
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,440
I don't want to upset her

1157
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,440
But I feel bored

1158
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,440
staying in the yard

1159
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,440
But I think

1160
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,440
my yard is good

1161
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,440
It's a little empty

1162
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,440
I wonder if you

1163
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,440
can help me

1164
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,440
ask the stewardess

1165
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,440
to get some pots and pans

1166
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,440
I can't help you

1167
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,440
with the three sisters' wedding ceremony

1168
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,440
But I want to make

1169
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,440
my house more lively

1170
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,440
Madam

1171
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,440
Well

1172
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,440
I…

1173
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,440
I know the rules of the house

1174
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,440
If you can

1175
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,440
help me

1176
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,440
besides this task

1177
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,440
there will be other things in the future

1178
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,440
I will take care of

1179
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,440
these two things

1180
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,440
You are a shameless woman

1181
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,440
who doesn't know the rules of the house

1182
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,440
Thank you, madam

1183
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,440
Madam

1184
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,440
You are so generous

1185
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,440
They are getting

1186
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,440
more and more from me

1187
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,440
At this time

1188
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,440
we don't know

1189
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,440
the rules of the house

1190
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,440
It seems that they don't want me

1191
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,440
to attend the wedding ceremony

1192
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,440
Ji Shuran

1193
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,440
has a good plan

1194
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,440
He doesn't want me

1195
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,440
to get close to the Jiang family

1196
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,440
and he doesn't want me

1197
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,440
to show up in front of others

1198
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,440
If I am as he wishes

1199
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,440
and I am always being played

1200
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,440
I will go back to the Jiang family

1201
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,440
but I don't think I will come back

1202
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,440
After all

1203
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,440
I am the second wife

1204
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,440
under the rumor

1205
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,440
So I have to

1206
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,440
go to the wedding ceremony

1207
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,440
I want to let
