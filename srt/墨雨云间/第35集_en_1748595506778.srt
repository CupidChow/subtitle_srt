1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I ignored the road

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The moon shines on all my efforts

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's in your heart

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That I write a letter

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then I laugh and cry

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I accept all the sad gifts

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't even dare to let go of my regrets

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I don't admit it

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I slowly reject the pain in my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been through the cold winter and I'm still lonely

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When the spring color is still the same

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Story of the Phoenix

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Slow down.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
One more time.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Be careful.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Thank you, Brother-in-law.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The Story of the Phoenix

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why are you laughing?

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm eating and drinking this time.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And the treatment is all by Duke Su's help.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's the matter?

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You are so funny.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're smarter than your sister.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Duke Su,

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
what brings you here today?

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll go with my uncle first.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll walk for a while.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't worry.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm very gentle.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Brother-in-law,

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
slow down.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll be back.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Mei Xiao.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Your Highness.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's the scent in this house?

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Your Highness, it's your favorite, Mo Li.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Why is it so disgusting?

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Your Highness,

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Doctor Zhang will be here soon.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
When Doctor Zhang comes,

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll prescribe two prescription for you.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I've got the medicine.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I won't feel so bad

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
if I let you take it.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm not feeling well.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Tell Shen Yirong.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I said so.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What did he say?

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He said

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I should take care of you.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How is it?

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why are you so quiet?

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Your Highness,

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I might have made a mistake.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Please forgive me.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I trust you

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
in the entire hospital.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Tell me

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
what's going on.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Otherwise,

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll punish you for deceiving me.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Raise your head.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You've been

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
a musician for a long time.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm afraid

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
you're pregnant.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How dare you!

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How dare you say that in front of me?

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I dare not.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Doctor Zhang,

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
what you said is true.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I dare not say it.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Did you forget

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the diagnosis

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
you gave me

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
when I brought you back?

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Your Highness,

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
you've been hurt too much.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Especially, you've had many minor injuries.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Blood and blood loss

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
are all caused by the disease.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's hard to get you back.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm afraid that

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you'll have a child

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
in the future.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's why I'm so surprised.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is a real disaster.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm a great person.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm so worried.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm so worried.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If I don't have this child,

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
will I be pregnant in the future?

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's hard to say

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
if I can have this kind of luck.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Look at your life.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How long will it take?

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I think

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
it's less than a month.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Doctor Zhang, you've worked hard today.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Take Doctor Zhang down.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Please have some tea.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No.

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm not in a hurry.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm going back.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
After a cup of tea,

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
your wife and son

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
won't mind.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Your Highness, please spare me.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Your Highness,

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Your Highness, please spare me.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Your Highness.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Your Highness, please spare me.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Your Highness, please spare me.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Your Highness.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Your Highness, please spare me.

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Your Highness.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm going to the Dazhao tonight.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So soon?

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
For your good show,

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I've already spent a day.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll go back to my room.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Please have some tea.

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Your Highness,

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Doctor Zhang,

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
please spare me.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Your Highness,

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
please spare me.

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Your Highness,

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
please spare me.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Your Highness,

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
please spare me.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Please spare me.

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's from September.

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I told you that

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
she was poisoned.

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I know that.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If I don't try it myself,

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
how do I know if it's good?

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Besides the prices,

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
what else can I do?

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Nothing else.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Before,

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I tried it myself.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I did not want to hear it.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Nonsense.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No nonsense.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wanning might not want to marry Shen Yurong.

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If she's pregnant,

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll have the chance to get out.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,160
Why would I care?

163
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,520
Before Wan Ning,

164
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,680
Shenheyu preserve you.

165
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,040
I can do that.

166
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,720
I know.

167
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,320
How did you poison Zhang's master?

168
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,240
She hided me.

169
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,640
But now she can't emerge from the clothes

170
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,400
I want to make an offering

171
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
to websites of the concubine.

172
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Just do it.

173
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,080
I didn't abuse her.

174
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,800
It's not poison that can harm people.

175
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,120
It's just a fake pregnancy.

176
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,880
After a while,

177
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,320
the drug will disappear naturally.

178
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,200
You're so bold.

179
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,200
Thanks to Duke Su's arrest of Consort Li,

180
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,600
I've told him to help me.

181
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,560
The marriage ceremony is over.

182
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,520
Do you still plan to do it?

183
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,720
Of course, I will.

184
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,480
I want to see

185
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,840
Wan Ning and Shen Yurong

186
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,120
being arrested.

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,840
I also want to help you

188
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,240
catch the Prince of Chen.

189
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,280
Shen Yurong

190
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,320
won't let him do that.

191
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,640
Then I won't have him.

192
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,320
Before I come back,

193
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,000
be careful with the situation.

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,120
If there's anything wrong,

195
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,640
let Zhao Ke send me a letter.

196
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,680
Or I'll make a decision when I come back.

197
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,000
I see, Duke Su.

198
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,040
I'm not that weak.

199
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,320
You're good.

200
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,840
I know that.

201
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,840
Before you leave,

202
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,240
I want to say thank you.

203
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,880
Thank you for taking me back to the capital.

204
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,320
Thank you.

205
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,760
I've never given up

206
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,200
my wife.

207
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,040
Now I'm full of energy.

208
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,080
It's time for me to return to my hometown.

209
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,480
Do you still remember

210
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,000
the words I said to you

211
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,440
when you were young?

212
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,400
I wish you a happy life.

213
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,880
I wish you good luck.

214
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,760
Now I want to say something.

215
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I hope you

216
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,440
live as you wish.

217
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,960
After a while, will it be finished?

218
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,040
Yes.

219
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,880
That's great.

220
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,840
Do you still remember

221
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,120
your father's funeral?

222
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,040
Master.

223
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,920
It was lost from day one.

224
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,920
Did you send your father

225
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,360
to the Grand Hall today?

226
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,220
Later, I will live a Moore girl

227
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:15,760
and be her

228
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,120
I will bring revenge for my master

229
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,320
It was me who felt

230
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,520
he cry but he cried

231
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,720
Your father is dead.

232
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,000
Why don't you cry?

233
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,440
My father said

234
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,160
if he kills the tea factory

235
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,600
one day,

236
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,480
I should be filial to him.

237
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,840
But you didn't laugh.

238
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,840
Maybe

239
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,640
he didn't kill the tea factory.

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,760
Do you want to check it?

241
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,480
Do you want me to check it?

242
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,000
There are a few people here.

243
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,160
You can help me check it.

244
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,000
Quite some people were not killed so quickly.

245
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,640
Let's go.

246
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,480
Didn't you want to check it?

247
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,000
Hand.

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,480
Hand.

249
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,080
Are you crazy?

250
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
You're so stubborn.

251
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,840
I've trusted you for eight years.

252
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,440
I'll always trust you.

253
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,080
Go back to your seat.

254
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,520
I'll be waiting for you in the capital.

255
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,920
Please leave.

256
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,880
There are twoLDwifes in this quiteável and it Starts early in the evening

257
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,280
Wife,

258
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,520
enjoy dancing,

259
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:28,960
efforts and efforts.

260
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,960
Again?

261
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,320
Then,

262
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,280
Your attention.

263
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,640
it seems

264
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,520
that you want me to dance with you

265
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,680
Buy whether to stop

266
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,320
China

267
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,140
Love is need,看一下 vessels.

268
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,280
Even the médiaث receiving

269
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,240
starting in the droit

270
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,040
is balefulness.

271
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,320
With the changing generation you live too??

272
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,080
Very few people like brilliant brilliant Colollan see it.

273
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
What princess?

274
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
She has been sent here as a hostage.

275
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
She still can't recognize her position.

276
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
From now on,

277
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,080
you will be the most scary sword in my camp.

278
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
Yikui.

279
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
I will go with her.

280
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,080
I will not go with her.

281
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Yikui.

282
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
Yikui.

283
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
Yikui.

284
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
This situation is really scary.

285
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,080
The truth is that I am a god.

286
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
If I don't want this child,

287
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
can I be pregnant?

288
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,080
It's hard to say whether you can be pregnant.

289
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Your Highness.

290
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Doctor Zhang's family has been taken care of.

291
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,080
What are you going to do next?

292
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,080
Are you going to keep this child?

293
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:56,080
If you keep looking for it,

294
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,080
you naturally will not do it.

295
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:08,080
I'm afraid you are afraid of being so sure about that

296
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,080
that you won't have power.

297
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,680
Don't you think that

298
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,720
I won't give up.

299
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,920
If I find out it's the flesh of that man,

300
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm afraid that his head will be destroyed.

301
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,960
Your Highness, you will surely feel bad.

302
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,120
But I'm his child.

303
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,600
I'll keep him.

304
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,160
As for what to do next,

305
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,720
I'm not in a hurry.

306
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,600
My child is not pregnant yet.

307
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,040
I can't tell.

308
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,120
The moment of the moment

309
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,040
is to raise my child well.

310
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,520
Now that the heart is broken,

311
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,080
I can't count the people who want to harm my child.

312
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,280
I have to protect him.

313
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,800
I will protect him.

314
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,520
Go and call Shen Yurong.

315
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,600
Right now.

316
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,040
Yes.

317
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,040
Fine.

318
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,760
Moth Monster!

319
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,540
and getoe...

320
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,020
I'm not good at it.

321
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,060
That makes me feel bad.

322
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,360
ış

323
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,080
The same if I'm afraid or not,

324
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,040
but just a little of the bad person.

325
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,900
If you get hurt,

326
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,560
you'll be cold-blooded.

327
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,540
Keep me awake.

328
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,260
Madame!

329
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,820
You must take good care of my daughter.

330
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,100
Leave her alone.

331
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,240
Old Tian.

332
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,860
Do you really not know your cranky gender?

333
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,400
Are you really rolling here

334
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,260
with what you have been through?

335
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,180
Miss Shen.

336
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,380
Please come to the Palace of the Lord.

337
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,820
How can you sexualize yourself like me.

338
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,160
Shui Laning...

339
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,740
Don't you Setup Domain of Abyss?

340
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,980
I make mistakes!

341
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,940
The answer of Savage Doctor Zhang...

342
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,020
Not wrong...

343
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,900
I'm not happy now...

344
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,100
I'm still mad at my wife.

345
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,220
What were you feeding me now?

346
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,380
How's my real ignition?

347
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,040
My child,

348
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,760
doesn't reason well.

349
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
It's just a matter of time.

350
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,600
I'll ask His Majesty to give me a marriage proposal.

351
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
Your Highness, don't be afraid.

352
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,440
At this moment, you're asking for a marriage proposal.

353
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,360
Will anyone think that you and I are in the same boat?

354
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,760
I don't care about that much.

355
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,360
But I can't ignore your reputation.

356
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,160
Your reputation?

357
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,600
Do you think I care about my reputation?

358
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,280
You used to care about it.

359
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Since I came back from Daigou,

360
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,920
I'll go back.

361
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,440
Your Highness.

362
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,480
All right.

363
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,600
I won't say it.

364
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,000
I just want my child to have a pure and decent father.

365
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,480
This is also my first child.

366
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,200
I also want to be his pure and decent father.

367
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,640
But I can't take this matter too seriously.

368
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,680
Otherwise, I'll be helpless.

369
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,920
What else can I do?

370
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,720
You don't want to marry me, do you?

371
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,600
Your Highness, you think too much.

372
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,320
Shen Yurong,

373
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,720
I'm the eldest princess of the Yan State.

374
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
I don't care about anything.

375
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,960
I only care about whether I can be loyal to the one I like.

376
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,160
I don't believe that

377
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,520
I can't get what I want.

378
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,000
What do you want me to do?

379
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What do you want me to do?

380
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,720
We should go back to the Shen Family

381
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
to rest in peace.

382
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,320
My lady.

383
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,640
How is the situation at the Palace of the Princess?

384
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,000
Shen Yurong just went to the Palace of the Princess.

385
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,800
Now that you're here,

386
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,520
you have to send her off.

387
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,800
What do you want me to do?

388
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,560
Burn them a little.

389
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,320
Drink it.

390
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,160
Why are you so careless?

391
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,080
Your guards think you're too strict.

392
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,360
Even I have to be 8 or 2 layers of skin.

393
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,760
Then why don't you take the spiritual lamp I gave you?

394
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,200
How could the soldiers recognize your spiritual lamp?

395
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,000
Then you can say directly

396
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,760
you're the Duke of Su of the Yan State.

397
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,080
Who dares to stop you?

398
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,920
I came here secretly.

399
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,120
Secretly?

400
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,680
You want to see me?

401
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,000
You still need to come here secretly?

402
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,320
I'm here to see your brother.

403
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,240
Who do you love to see?

404
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,440
Go, go, go.

405
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,800
Don't stay here.

406
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,480
I didn't expect the guards of Dazhao to be so powerful.

407
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,200
If it weren't for the spiritual lamp in September,

408
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,640
I'm afraid they would have died.

409
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,000
Duke of Su is joking.

410
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,640
With your skills,

411
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,920
as long as you don't want to be caught,

412
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,720
it's hard to get a chance to defend against Dazhao.

413
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,400
You did it on purpose.

414
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,640
If you get hurt early and get caught early,

415
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,520
in case there's any mistake,

416
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,560
you'll be misunderstood.

417
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:18,800
Tell me.

418
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
What do you want me to do?

419
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,200
I want to see you.

420
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,400
I want a team

421
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,880
to defend our Yan State.

422
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,000
It could be a traitor.

423
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,320
Before you came,

424
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,000
the people of Lord Cheng have come to see me.

425
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,120
When Lord Cheng was on the north side of the war,

426
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,560
His Majesty only needed to retreat from Dazhao's border

427
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,320
to attract the Yan State's army.

428
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,000
Zhao Ye's father was defeated.

429
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,320
He must be at a loss.

430
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,160
But Lord Cheng was called a emperor.

431
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,520
He didn't have to bring Dazhao back.

432
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,560
His Majesty just drove away the rebel forces in the country.

433
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,320
He wanted to use the support of the Yan State.

434
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,480
But if His Majesty doesn't want to cooperate,

435
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,920
he'll have to help Zhao Ye's father and his son.

436
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,600
That's the first thing

437
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,080
that Lord Cheng wants to do.

438
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
It's to clear the plan.

439
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,160
Are you threatening me?

440
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:03,920
I dare not.

441
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,000
Lord Cheng is far away from Zhao Ye.

442
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,040
I just don't want His Majesty to be confused

443
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
and give up the opportunity to fight.

444
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,120
About Lord Yan and Lord Cheng,

445
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,360
my officials have discussed it with them.

446
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,040
As the emperor of Lord Yan,

447
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,040
you're not over half the number.

448
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,160
Duke Su,

449
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,360
I hope you can understand me.

450
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,200
If I help you,

451
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,120
I'll not only kill my family,

452
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,160
but also kill my Dazhao and Guo Yun.

453
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,240
So, no matter which side you win,

454
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
as long as you, the emperor or the king of Yan,

455
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,400
are willing to bring Dazhao peace,

456
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,400
I can accept it.

457
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,400
His Majesty is waiting for me to leave the palace.

458
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,480
If His Majesty thinks Lord Cheng is the best,

459
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,560
I'm afraid he has already made an appointment with Lord Cheng.

460
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,400
Isn't that so?

461
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,440
This is your own business.

462
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,440
I can't control Dazhao.

463
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,040
If Lord Cheng wins,

464
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,800
I'll prepare a big gift for Lord Cheng.

465
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,400
That time and now,

466
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,840
are two things.

467
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,360
What do you want me to do?

468
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,320
Didn't His Majesty just have a meeting with Lord Yan?

469
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,760
Zhao Ye thinks you're his guard.

470
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
He wants to take the army.

471
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,200
Lord Cheng doesn't want much.

472
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,560
As long as you continue to give him this wrong decision,

473
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,320
when Lord Cheng is getting up,

474
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,040
he still wants to see you off.

475
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,920
I didn't agree to the king.

476
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,240
But I'll agree to you if I don't see him.

477
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,680
His Majesty said that

478
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,440
as long as His Majesty is willing to help,

479
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,120
the conditions and you,

480
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,160
you and Lord Cheng are just the most important.

481
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,760
Even if he wins,

482
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,720
he won't necessarily thank you.

483
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,240
And you're only saying to His Majesty

484
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,560
that he's the one who gave you the gift.

485
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,120
He won't treat you well.

486
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,200
Even if Lord Yan really wins,

487
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,680
how can I be sure?

488
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,880
Lord Yan will do his best

489
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,040
to fulfill his promise.

490
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,800
His Majesty personally visited Lord Yan

491
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,480
and saw me surpassing him.

492
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,880
His Majesty is sincere.

493
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,240
Can't he trust me?

494
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,760
I can't trust him.

495
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,000
But I trust you.

496
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,560
It depends on whether you agree to my conditions.

497
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,040
May I know why you won't accept the gift?

498
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,520
Did you hear that

499
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,140
the чемanto is pregnant?

500
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,240
It's a bunch of nonsense.

501
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,600
Stop Among the娘es.

502
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
King of Tr 이제 have ships,

503
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,400
how can there be ships conging by her father?

504
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,840
How can there be ships conging by her father?

505
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,200
You're cheating, right?

506
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,960
How can the King of Tr Haiti have ships conging by her father?

507
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,240
Are you sure?

508
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,600
Then who is it?

509
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,280
Where is father Zhen's prince consort?

510
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,000
Mother. Mother.

511
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Where is my brother?

512
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,720
He went to Hanlin Academy in the morning.

513
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,840
Why are you so anxious to see him?

514
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,800
I heard that

515
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,560
he has a pregnancy.

516
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,120
Did my brother tell you?

517
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,800
Who told you?

518
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,720
Everyone in the world is saying that.

519
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
You're so stupid.

520
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
If it's true,

521
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,240
your brother has told us long ago.

522
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,000
When did he tell us

523
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,160
about my brother and the princess?

524
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,960
No.

525
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,160
I'm going to Hanlin Academy now.

526
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,160
Ask him what's going on.

527
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,440
Your Majesty.

528
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,760
I heard from the Imperial Court

529
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,720
that you didn't drink the medicine.

530
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,320
The medicine is getting worse.

531
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,320
I drank it for a night.

532
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,800
I'll let you go this night.

533
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,760
Your Majesty.

534
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,400
You have a cold.

535
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,840
The medicine is cure and treatment.

536
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,920
It's best to have it together.

537
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,640
I'll let them warm up.

538
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,160
Your Majesty.

539
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,480
You should drink it.

540
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,120
Don't make me think about it.

541
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,160
Don't worry.

542
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,240
You

543
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,520
always have a lot of ways to cure the medicine.

544
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,320
Your Majesty.

545
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,160
I heard a rumor recently.

546
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,920
What rumor?

547
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,920
I heard that

548
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,040
Princess Wanning

549
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,080
has a pregnancy.

550
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,040
She has been sent to the palace.

551
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,400
You said

552
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,200
that she will have such rumors

553
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,080
in the palace.

554
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,040
Why is it so ridiculous?

555
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,080
Yes.

556
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,480
It's about the royal family's reputation.

557
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,400
Does the rumor

558
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,920
want to harm the royal family?

559
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,880
What do you think?

560
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Send a doctor

561
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,640
to send a pulse to Wanning.

562
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,720
The rumor will be exposed.

563
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
It's a good idea.

564
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,360
But

565
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,040
if the doctor goes there alone,

566
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,880
I'm afraid she will be kicked out

567
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,400
by Wanning.

568
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,280
I'm willing to go with the doctor

569
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
and ask her

570
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,760
to go with you.

571
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,080
Since the rumor

572
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,320
has been exposed,

573
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,000
I haven't seen her for a long time.

574
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,640
Okay.

575
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,560
Thank you for your help.

576
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,280
I should.

577
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,120
Let me tell you.

578
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,400
Princess Wanning

579
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,400
is pregnant.

580
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,240
Did you hear that?

581
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,600
I don't know.

582
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,760
I just heard from others.

583
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,040
It's true.

584
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
How dare you?

585
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,920
You're so mean.

586
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,240
You're not even a child.

587
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,600
Did you find the books

588
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,960
that you want?

589
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,160
Let's find them again.

590
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,240
Yurong.

591
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,880
Come out and talk.

592
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,920
Come.

593
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,480
Mother, what's the matter with you?

594
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,840
What's wrong with you and Princess Wanning?

595
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,480
They're all out there.

596
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,680
Princess Wanning is pregnant.

597
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,160
What do you mean?

598
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
The whole street is changing.

599
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,520
Don't go.

600
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,560
Tell me.

601
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,280
What's wrong with you and Princess Wanning?

602
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,000
Can't you see it?

603
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,200
Since the rumor has been exposed,

604
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,320
someone must be

605
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,800
coming out from behind.

606
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,840
I'm afraid it's a conspiracy.

607
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,720
I'll think of a solution.

608
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,920
Don't come out of the mess, Mother.

609
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,880
Consort Li, your慢.

610
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,100
Princess innr.

611
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,760
How come you're free today?

612
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,000
Recently, I heard

613
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,600
some saying aboutigadies.

614
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,840
Come and see them.

615
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,000
What language?

616
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,360
Someone said that

617
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,800
the princess is pregnant.

618
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,120
You believe that?

619
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,320
I don't believe it.

620
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,720
I don't believe you.

621
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,400
So today,

622
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,280
I'll bring the imperial physician

623
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,920
to you.

624
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,320
How dare you!

625
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,880
I can't just

626
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,440
just let you off.

627
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,520
It's because it's a rumor

628
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,880
that we need to find out.

629
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,840
After all, it's out there

630
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,520
to tell the story of the doctor

631
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,120
who was sent out by the princess.

632
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,600
But now,

633
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,840
I don't know where he is.

634
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,760
The imperial physician is responsible.

635
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,960
So,

636
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,280
I'll take the doctor

637
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,400
to see if he's sick.

638
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,600
It's good that he's not.

639
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,400
The women in the palace

640
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,880
still have a peaceful life.

641
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,680
Although you're out there,

642
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,200
you should take care of your health.

643
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,560
Old Dong Xi dares to spread my rumors

644
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,040
and bring me to him

645
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,640
to tear his mouth.

646
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,000
The imperial physician is looking for him too.

647
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,680
It's a pity

648
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,560
that he's out of the family.

649
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,120
If he can't find him again,

650
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,840
he should find you.

651
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,960
I'm sure that Old Dong Xi

652
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,920
and his family will escape together.

653
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,520
Your Highness, don't worry.

654
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,800
I thought so at first.

655
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,280
But I didn't expect

656
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,760
that there's another rumor

657
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,480
that the doctor, Zhang,

658
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,160
might know

659
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,280
the secret of the uneducated man

660
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,240
and be ordered by others.

661
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,760
What shameless way

662
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,480
to confront me?

663
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,680
I wanted to

664
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,680
catch that person who was in the trouble.

665
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,640
But when I think about it,

666
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,120
the more I catch him,

667
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,480
the more I feel that our royal family is in need.

668
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,760
I'm thinking about it.

669
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
I'd rather

670
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,720
break the rumor.

671
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
Am I right, Manning?

672
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,800
Doctor Chu,

673
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,080
give the princess a good treatment.

674
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,720
Yes, Your Highness.

675
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,960
Princess, please.

676
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,560
Princess,

677
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,640
I'm the princess.

678
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,760
You're so humble.

679
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,880
How can you break the rumor

680
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,360
by breaking the evidence?

681
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,080
You don't know what I'm talking about.

682
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,800
If that's the case,

683
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,440
I'll report it to His Majesty.

684
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,720
Princess,

685
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,880
wait for His Majesty to send the edict.

686
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,680
You may leave.

687
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,480
I'll talk to Consort Li alone.

688
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,760
Consort Li,

689
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,600
I think you're not in the mood to wake up.

690
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,920
Why do you forget about Consort Xian?

691
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,760
Before Princess is threatened,

692
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,720
you should check who's in your hand.

693
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
What do you mean?

694
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,120
Princess is so smart.

695
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,080
Do you need me to remind you?

696
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,880
Are you going to stand on Consort Xue's side?

697
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,640
I don't want to stand on either side.

698
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,080
I can't stand on either side.

699
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,760
Since my sister is ill,

700
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,400
my heart has never been so strong.

701
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
It's you.

702
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,520
You forced me first.

703
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,000
I don't like people threatening me the most.

704
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
All right.

705
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,240
That's all for today.

706
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,160
I'll report it to His Majesty in person.

707
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
Princess,

708
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,800
you should also take good care of yourself.

709
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
When you're free,

710
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,560
think about it.

711
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,080
How can I explain to His Majesty

712
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,560
the reason why you're pregnant?

713
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,280
Your Highness,

714
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,720
Shen Xue is here.

715
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,480
You are finally here.

716
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,400
Now, pick me up to Twins.

717
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Twins?

718
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,680
I can't sign with you now.

719
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,680
Run?

720
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,760
Don't you know Consort Li has just arrived here?

721
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,440
Maybe you know how dangerous she is.

722
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,480
It's full of�

723
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,240
danger.

724
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,520
You're not my father.

725
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,680
The emperor should know

726
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,880
what I'm thinking.

727
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,960
You're not a father.

728
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,000
How can I explain to my child?

729
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,520
Who is his father?

730
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,880
Li Fei.

731
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,240
Isn't he the one on your side?

732
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,400
You don't care about Li Fei.

733
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,560
Li Fei is a dog.

734
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,800
He's good to anyone who gives him a bone.

735
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,280
What are you hesitating about?

736
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,800
What are you going to do?

737
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
Your Highness, you don't think it's wrong?

738
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,720
Something happened recently.

739
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,520
It seems like there's a pair of hands behind you.

740
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,040
What do you mean?

741
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,160
When you're pregnant,

742
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,400
the news immediately leaked.

743
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,640
It spread from the city to the streets.

744
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,640
Even the court.

745
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,720
After that, Li Fei took the official name of Yao Yan

746
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,280
and brought the imperial physician to the door.

747
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,360
If no one controls everything behind it,

748
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,080
how could things happen so quickly?

749
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,120
Who did it?

750
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,840
Li Fei?

751
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,600
Consort Xu?

752
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,680
Or Xiao Heng?

753
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,320
Or are they going to do it together?

754
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,240
What are they going to do?

755
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,680
Your Highness, calm down.

756
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,960
No matter who they are,

757
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,680
we just need to figure out their intentions.

758
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,800
They can't control us.

759
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,320
What do you think their intentions are?

760
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,800
I think what they want to see

761
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,840
is our relationship.

762
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,920
In this case, we're only controlling your relationship.

763
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,480
We're not in the same place.

764
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,080
We're investigating the blood family's life.

765
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
We're making a path.

766
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,400
The blood family's case?

767
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,040
How can we find out so easily?

768
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,920
Why should we care?

769
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
The blood family is small.

770
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,320
Where's the King of the City?

771
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,360
The King of the City is about to arrive.

772
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,040
The war is about to begin.

773
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,200
If His Highness is in danger,

774
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,000
the King of the City will be killed.

775
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,520
Your Highness.

776
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,080
With the King of the City's rescue,

777
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,440
the country will be in a state of chaos.

778
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,960
No one will ask us about it.

779
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,440
We can still have many children.

780
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,040
Shen Yirong!

781
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,040
You know this child!

782
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,040
For me,

783
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,640
how unbearable you are!

784
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,680
I'm telling you.

785
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,920
Even if you beat me up,

786
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,200
I'll keep it!

787
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,200
So,

788
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,840
are you willing to suffer?

789
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,680
Do you have a way to protect him?

790
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,760
Promise me.

791
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,160
I have a way.

792
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,200
But Wanning,

793
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,560
I don't want you to do that.

794
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,080
What do you want me to suffer?

795
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,120
This child's father

796
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,120
can only be

797
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,960
understood.

798
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,800
What did you say?

799
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,640
This is the only way to protect the child.

800
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,160
This is your child, Shen Yirong!

801
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,360
I understand.

802
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,200
But you have to keep this child

803
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,080
so that people can believe that there's a reasonable father.

804
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,080
The whole court

805
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,520
is the only one who can be qualified

806
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,560
and listen to what you have to say.

807
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,720
I'm afraid you've thought about it.

808
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,640
The second prince of Li family,

809
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,080
Li Lian Chu Jia,

810
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
is not married.

811
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,400
He's the best man in the family.

812
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,640
That's the only place

813
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,200
that can make you feel at ease.

814
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,320
For our child,

815
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,840
we must be patient.

816
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,840
When the child is born,

817
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,400
I'm sure that the king of the city will be happy.

818
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,240
By then,

819
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,760
we can find a suitable person

820
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,040
to be with.

821
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,520
In this way,

822
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,760
those who want to destroy us

823
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,880
won't have a chance.

824
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,600
Shen Yirong.

825
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,560
You said it so much.

826
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,840
Isn't it because you didn't want to be my father?

827
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,360
Isn't it true?

828
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,080
I'm not enough.

829
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,040
You can make any choice.

830
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,040
I'll be with you.

831
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,000
Don't touch me.

832
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,800
Don't touch me!

833
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,680
Are you pushing me?

834
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,040
Yirong.

835
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,120
You know it.

836
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,400
You know everything.

837
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,480
Father, you mean

838
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,080
you want me to be the father of the princess?

839
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,480
Is there any problem?

840
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,240
Have you heard

841
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,160
about the rumors about the princess?

842
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,520
I have.

843
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,480
Our family is not a lowly family.

844
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,880
How can we let a child who is not well-known

845
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,720
take the position of our family's grandson?

846
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,080
I know it's not good.

847
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,360
But this is also a chance

848
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,200
to make the palace.

849
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,480
The back of your eldest princess

850
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,400
is the king.

851
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,800
Father, have you thought about it?

852
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,240
This child is still alive.

853
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,600
But in our family,

854
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,920
there is something short and short.

855
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,720
We will all be implicated.

856
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,600
I know

857
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,480
the importance of this matter.

858
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,360
But this is the order of the princess.

859
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,200
There is no possibility that the house is not abandoned.

860
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,400
Jing'er,

861
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,240
if the princess can marry you,

862
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,440
it will be good for us and the alliance.

863
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,640
You are a smart person.

864
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,760
You must know the importance of this matter.

865
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,680
Miss.

866
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,160
I heard from this person

867
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,000
that the spine of your eldest princess has ended up with Li.

868
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,080
Li?

869
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,080
Really?

870
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,400
What about I go into the room and check the details?

871
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,320
All right.

872
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,120
Good job, and Shen Yirong.

873
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,240
The opinion is good and clear.

874
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:38,760
In the spring,

875
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,200
people will question you.

876
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,680
It starts to affect your life.

877
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,680
I underestimated your mood.

878
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,680
The light is gone.

879
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,680
I'm going to burn it down.

880
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,680
Even if there's a little bit of a problem.

881
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,680
No matter if it's a life or death.

882
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,680
I believe in you.

883
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,680
The moon is trapped in the cold of the world.

884
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,680
I'm going to burn it down.

885
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,680
Even if there's a little bit of a problem.

886
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,680
I'm going to burn it down.

887
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,680
Even if there's a little bit of a problem.

888
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,680
The light is gone.

889
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,680
Even if there's a little bit of a problem.

890
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,680
No matter if it's a life or death.

891
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,680
I'm not far away.

892
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,680
After the light is gone.

893
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,680
I'm not far away.
