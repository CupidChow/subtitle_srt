Winner, his calf

A question of love

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,260
This time my heart is

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,100
Friend

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,100
I've written all the lyrics

16
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,100
I've written all the lyrics

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,100
No one in the whole world

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,100
Should be more focused than them

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,100
No one in the whole world

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,100
Should be more focused than them

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,100
The high-level position

22
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,100
Is the first step in the isolation

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,100
The first step in the isolation

24
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,100
The first step in the isolation

25
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,100
The first step in the isolation

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,100
The first step in the isolation

27
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,100
The first step in the isolation

28
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,100
The first step in the isolation

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,100
The first step in the isolation

30
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,100
The first step in the isolation

31
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,100
The first step in the isolation

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,100
The first step in the isolation

33
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,100
The first step in the isolation

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,140
You say

35
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,140
If they divorce

36
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,140
You must tell me who will I follow

37
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,140
Your mother divorced

38
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,180
Just divorce

39
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,180
They quarreled every day

40
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,140
You'd better just divorce

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,140
What is divorce

42
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,140
I just mean to ask Yingbi

43
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,060
No, you can't

44
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,500
What to do

45
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,900
You move

46
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,020
What you say

47
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,980
You say

48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,560
I am a Fu

49
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,940
I'm a Fu

50
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,540
I really want to

51
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,620
Tell me

52
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,940
VP

53
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,400
Director

54
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,020
I let him tell me

55
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,780
What to do

56
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,020
You say

57
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,820
You told me

58
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,100
It's the other way around again

59
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,260
What are you thinking?

60
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,660
Leave

61
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,580
Son

62
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,140
Leave the front, not the back

63
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,460
Leave the back

64
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,140
What you want with the pose

65
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,700
They'll think of you

66
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,220
One more time

67
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,860
Wasn't that a bit too much?

68
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,540
Look at him

69
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,580
Maybe

70
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,140
I'll go back

71
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,420
Let's go home

72
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,180
Look at this room

73
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,060
I've cleaned it up before you came back

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,980
It's clean

75
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,820
I've opened the window for you

76
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,420
I've exhaled

77
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,420
There's no smell at all

78
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,900
Look at those flowers

79
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,540
I've taken good care of them for you

80
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,260
Look, isn't it as beautiful as before?

81
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,380
It's nice

82
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,540
And Gui is at Dr. Zhao's place

83
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,100
I'll contact him later

84
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,460
and get Gui back

85
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,340
This house

86
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,020
is exactly the same as before

87
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,140
OK

88
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,140
Xu

89
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,460
I

90
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,540
I would like to take a used-room

91
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
Sure

92
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,020
Over there

93
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,580
OK

94
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:18,980
Xiao freaking

95
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,720
pasta

96
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,940
I can't forget him

97
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,820
Who is he?

98
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,740
He's Gui

99
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,140
He's my police

100
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,140
Miss Shi, would you like to...

101
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,980
I'm going out to buy something

102
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,460
Please take care of him

103
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,540
Okay, no problem

104
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,620
Shi Yi, come on, let's get up

105
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,500
Why do you want to get married?

106
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,580
I'm an прирangly

107
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,340
Where did you get the flag?

108
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,060
Aunt, this way

109
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,060
Son

110
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,260
fries

111
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:17,980
Wash it

112
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,580
Thank you

113
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,180
ç

114
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,420
I'm here to see you

115
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,100
Thank you, director

116
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,860
It's okay. Let's go

117
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,620
Director, this umbrella...

118
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,660
It's your brother's

119
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,780
I borrowed it last time

120
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,500
I forgot to return it to him

121
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,100
It's really his umbrella

122
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,060
I saw you two playing with this umbrella that day

123
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,820
And you were so cold

124
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,220
Cold?

125
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,060
It was in the bathroom

126
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,260
I was so cold

127
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,060
I was so cold

128
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,020
I was so cold

129
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,340
It was on the road to the hospital

130
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,260
I saw it as soon as I came out

131
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,100
So?

132
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,020
No, no

133
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,340
Director, I didn't see it on purpose

134
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,180
I walked this way every day

135
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,260
So I didn't mean it

136
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,060
No

137
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,820
Director, director

138
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,060
Director, I didn't mean it

139
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,100
Listen to me

140
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,260
Dong Cheng, don't make me laugh

141
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,780
I found that you have improved a lot

142
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,860
in?scripture recently

143
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,060
I learned it from you

144
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,100
Before I met you

145
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
I read some of your works

146
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,460
I memorized some of them

147
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,900
You're not serious

148
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,580
You should read more professional books

149
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,500
I'm not good at it

150
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,740
It's useless to read those boring ones

151
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,860
You're right

152
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,300
I should be polite to you

153
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,500
I taught you for nothing

154
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,580
You're so stupid

155
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,300
But you're right

156
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,500
I should cherish you

157
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,940
when we meet again

158
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,100
You're back again

159
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,740
After the surgery

160
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,780
he stopped being busy

161
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,300
I should have known it

162
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,100
and prepared for it

163
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,220
Xia is a good girl

164
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,760
So you two are really

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,680
淦bals?

166
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,020
You two really look like each other

167
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,900
Stay away from him

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's really hard to move

169
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,980
It sounds different

170
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,260
You guys are crazy

171
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,040
Are you nuts?

172
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,180
I don't mind

173
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,020
It's really good

174
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,800
Listen

175
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,300
I need to count

176
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,980
everything of these people

177
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Don't disgust me.

178
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,860
So you're really just friends.

179
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,740
Just stay next to me.

180
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,780
I'm wearing an umbrella.

181
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,780
I'm wearing an umbrella.

182
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,100
What about Zhao Dong Cheng?

183
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,380
Ask him yourself.

184
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,020
I...

185
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,540
It's okay.

186
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,900
Just take some painkillers.

187
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,220
You can't go to the electrician or the air conditioner.

188
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,020
It's autumn.

189
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
It's cold.

190
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,740
Dr. Zhao,

191
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,580
I started to feel sick yesterday.

192
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,980
I didn't sleep at all.

193
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,620
Look.

194
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,580
It's itchy.

195
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,740
Don't scratch it.

196
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,820
It's allergic. What are you eating?

197
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,820
Shrimp.

198
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,700
Don't scratch it.

199
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,780
Just take some painkillers.

200
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,780
You have to apply it every day.

201
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,060
Okay, thank you.

202
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,700
Dr. Zhao,

203
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,100
it's not good for the stomach.

204
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
It's always constipated.

205
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,260
It can open the intestines.

206
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,660
You can't drink long-term tea.

207
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,460
If you drink for a long time,

208
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,460
you can't get rid of it.

209
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,540
It's normal for old people to have stomach pain.

210
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,860
Eat more fruits and vegetables.

211
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,700
When you're free,

212
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,380
you can massage it.

213
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,260
And take a look at it.

214
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,860
Okay?

215
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,700
You have to remember what the doctor said.

216
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,620
Okay.

217
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,780
Okay, let's go.

218
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,300
Thank you.

219
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,060
Thank you.

220
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,340
Okay.

221
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,140
Bye.

222
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,740
Bye.

223
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,060
Bye.

224
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,460
Say bye to your uncle.

225
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,060
Bye.

226
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,260
I'm home.

227
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,140
You're really something.

228
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,220
You can show it to four people with one number.

229
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,260
You can read a hundred books.

230
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,820
I can do it all.

231
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,260
You're really something, Director Yu.

232
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Every time I let you

233
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,780
take a building's stuff,

234
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,540
you don't know how much you care about my brother.

235
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,220
I've come and gone

236
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,540
and I've been good to Xiaoxia many times.

237
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,740
You're not comfortable?

238
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,580
No.

239
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,380
I just feel a little strange today.

240
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
It may be because

241
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,060
I didn't sleep well last night.

242
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,780
I feel strange today.

243
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,380
I feel like someone is staring at me.

244
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,180
You're dreaming in the middle of the day.

245
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,620
This hospital is full of patients.

246
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,660
Who's watching you?

247
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,140
I guess I didn't sleep well.

248
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,060
Okay, go to work.

249
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,620
Sleep early tonight.

250
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,740
Don't play with your phone in the room.

251
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,180
Okay, Doctor Shen.

252
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,060
Please come this way.

253
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,340
Liu Jin.

254
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,980
Uncle Lin.

255
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,580
You're not staying in the ward.

256
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,900
Why are you wandering around here?

257
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,540
I'm looking for you.

258
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,900
Doctor Zhang said

259
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,060
I've been too nervous recently.

260
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,460
I'm looking for you

261
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,020
to help me take the needle.

262
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,220
Relax.

263
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,100
Uncle Lin, don't make trouble.

264
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,940
If you're thinking too much,

265
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,460
you can just wander around and play chess.

266
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,500
As long as you have a broad mind,

267
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,340
it's much easier for you to take the needle than me.

268
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,060
I heard

269
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,140
the bed in your ward

270
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,780
is much more comfortable than the bed in the ward.

271
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:12,900
Wait.

272
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,420
Wait for your turn.

273
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,780
Uncle Lin.

274
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,180
Uncle Lin.

275
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,060
I need to go to the toilet.

276
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,580
I've been waiting for a long time.

277
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,500
I finally have time.

278
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,860
Let me go to the toilet first.

279
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,180
Okay?

280
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,660
Wait.

281
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,540
Sign this first.

282
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,620
Then go to the toilet.

283
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,420
No, Uncle Lin.

284
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,580
If you tell me the truth about the disease,

285
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,780
will it be more reliable than the test result?

286
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,620
Besides, look at you.

287
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,540
You can eat, drink, run,

288
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,780
play chess and play cards.

289
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,780
You're a healthy

290
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,940
and smart person.

291
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,500
Right?

292
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,740
Don't fool me.

293
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,100
Let me see.

294
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,980
You're a good speaker.

295
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:53,860
Come on.

296
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,020
Sign it for me.

297
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:57,740
Uncle Lin.

298
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,100
Listen to me.

299
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,420
As a doctor,

300
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,260
I can't just sign

301
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,740
a random pen.

302
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,260
A doctor's pen and signature

303
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,140
are important.

304
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,340
Important?

305
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,500
What?

306
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,100
Can I tell you

307
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,660
the secret of the medical field?

308
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,100
But...

309
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,020
I can tell you the truth today.

310
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,740
Do you want to hear it?

311
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,660
Look.

312
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,980
Usually, when you sign and write a prescription,

313
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,500
you use a blue-black pen

314
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,100
or a carbon ink ink pen.

315
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,260
Pay attention to it later.

316
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,300
Zhao Dongcheng's chest

317
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,780
must have this kind of pen.

318
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,340
You can write a medical book

319
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,820
like the Pregnancy Test,

320
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,900
and the Pregnancy of the Disease,

321
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,020
all with red pen.

322
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,060
So the fish master

323
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,260
must have this kind of pen.

324
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,140
There's another kind of pen.

325
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,300
It's amazing.

326
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,340
Do you know whose pen it is?

327
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,900
Whose?

328
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,340
Dr. Zhang Jun.

329
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,940
His pen is brighter than the other.

330
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,900
It's like a copper pen.

331
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,940
Right.

332
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,860
Okay.

333
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,580
The more you talk, the more confused I am.

334
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,420
I was going to sign it for you.

335
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,380
Why are you talking about

336
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,060
a blue-black pen or a red pen?

337
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,700
Okay.

338
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,020
Stop talking nonsense.

339
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,340
Go to the bathroom now.

340
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,060
I'll wait for you in your office.

341
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,500
Sign it for me when you come back.

342
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,460
Then you go to the office first.

343
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,780
Okay. I'll wait for you.

344
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,420
Okay.

345
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,780
Hurry up.

346
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,540
No. 135, Lin Chenghan.

347
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,220
Mr. Liu.

348
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,340
What's up?

349
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,860
What's the situation with Mr. Lin?

350
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,060
No. 135, Lin Chenghan.

351
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,940
Mr. Lin got the cancer three years ago.

352
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,580
He was so scared.

353
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,900
He worked so hard

354
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,260
to recover.

355
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,260
I don't know who influenced him recently.

356
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,260
He watched the news

357
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,460
of the relapse of the cancer.

358
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,820
He said he had a stomachache.

359
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,500
But your brother

360
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,300
asked him to do another checkup.

361
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,660
He hasn't heard from him recently.

362
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,900
A professional.

363
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,820
What kind of profession is he?

364
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,980
He used to be

365
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,380
the post-mortem officer of our company.

366
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,540
Before he retired,

367
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,220
he never had a chance to catch bad guys.

368
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,980
After he retired,

369
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,380
he gained a lot of strength.

370
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,620
Forget it. It's not the point.

371
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,060
Then the point is...

372
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,420
The point is

373
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,300
he has been torturing us

374
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,660
so hard.

375
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,420
Anyway,

376
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,100
you should pay attention to him.

377
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,820
Okay. I'll go over there first.

378
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,540
I can't do it anymore.

379
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,820
Can you please

380
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,620
the medical examination of the Central Hospital?

381
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,740
Let him have the result in advance.

382
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,260
I can't stand this torture anymore.

383
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,860
Do you think I didn't ask?

384
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,860
But I can't let him be wrong.

385
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,260
He's going to make me crazy.

386
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,260
What happened?

387
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,260
He spent a whole morning

388
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,460
on me there.

389
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,060
He just stayed there and didn't leave.

390
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,820
He insisted that we lied to him.

391
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,260
He said we were not going to leave.

392
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,460
He said we were going to leave.

393
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,660
He said we were going to leave.

394
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,860
He said we were going to leave.

395
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,460
He said we were not going to tell him the truth.

396
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,380
But I told him

397
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,660
that the result didn't come out.

398
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,180
It didn't come out.

399
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,780
He just didn't believe me.

400
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,020
He asked me to write him

401
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,660
a love letter of truth and promise.

402
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,180
It has to be a fair one.

403
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,900
I heard what he said.

404
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,180
If we lied to him,

405
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,660
he would have to go to the court to sue us.

406
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,860
Hasn't his son been here for a long time?

407
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,740
I told you.

408
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,580
They are all on us.

409
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,700
His son can't just leave, can he?

410
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,580
Even if Lin didn't come to the house often...

411
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,500
Why didn't he come to me?

412
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
To you?

413
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,980
Your face and your expression.

414
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,340
You haven't been in the ice mountain for a long time.

415
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,820
He wants to die for you.

416
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,660
I think you want to die.

417
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,380
Who dares to come to you with this attitude?

418
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,580
You want to die too?

419
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,900
No.

420
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,380
Director Yu is quite gentle.

421
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,580
But he rarely gets close to people.

422
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,260
You are too obvious.

423
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,620
I heard what Xun said.

424
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,620
Too obvious.

425
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,380
He has grown up.

426
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,060
He has become the leader of the Eighth Sister.

427
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,820
He has a good taste.

428
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,740
Unlike you, he is blind.

429
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,660
Zhao,

430
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,380
help me think of a way

431
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,900
to deal with what Cheng said.

432
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,660
Yes.

433
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,420
You are smart.

434
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,420
You should be more careful.

435
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,260
Okay.

436
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,020
I'll try.

437
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,460
You just left.

438
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,420
Why did you go up again?

439
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,540
Lin,

440
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,300
why do you see me going up?

441
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,100
You just went up.

442
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,020
What do you mean?

443
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,420
You are too lazy.

444
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,220
I won't go up with you.

445
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,180
I won't go up with you.

446
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,980
I'll go.

447
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,700
I'll tell you.

448
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,460
Go away.

449
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,700
I'll...

450
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,420
You have ruined a few steps.

451
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,180
I'll tell you.

452
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,980
Okay.

453
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,300
Come on.

454
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:32,900
Jiang...

455
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,740
Jiang Lin.

456
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,460
Damn it.

457
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,020
Just a little bit.

458
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,140
I mean,

459
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,660
you are a man of your word.

460
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,300
Bro,

461
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,900
you just went up

462
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,660
without saying anything.

463
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,260
No.

464
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,340
The dead flag

465
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,980
is so alive

466
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,540
when it's gone.

467
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,460
You are a master.

468
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,300
A master.

469
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,740
You are just fooling around.

470
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,220
Master, let me ask you.

471
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,460
Do we have a break at the community hospital?

472
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,820
The community hospital has a lunch break.

473
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,740
We start working at 2 p.m.

474
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,740
Your hat,

475
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,940
your mask, your glasses

476
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,820
are all so dirty.

477
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,980
What's wrong with you?

478
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,060
Are you infected?

479
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,620
I'm not here to see a doctor.

480
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,100
I'm here to find someone.

481
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,180
Someone?

482
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,180
Who?

483
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,020
Just ask.

484
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,260
The doctors and nurses in the hospital.

485
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,580
None of them I don't know.

486
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,140
Just ask.

487
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,420
Yes.

488
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,220
They all know.

489
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,220
A son of a relative.

490
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,220
I'm on a business trip.

491
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,220
I happen to visit him.

492
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,620
You can just go in later.

493
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,620
He's having some trouble with his family.

494
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,220
He's really a long-winded man.

495
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,020
Yes.

496
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,420
All the old ladies are like this.

497
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,020
My wife

498
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,620
is dying.

499
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,220
She doesn't come to see me.

500
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,420
I won't bother you.

501
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,220
Li.

502
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,420
It's your turn.

503
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,620
What are you looking at?

504
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,620
I didn't tell the truth.

505
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,820
I lied.

506
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,820
You just said a few words

507
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,220
and you knew it.

508
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,420
Do you know what a portrait is?

509
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,820
What?

510
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,420
A portrait?

511
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
Li.

512
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
You're not comfortable with me

513
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,020
coming to see Dr. Zhang?

514
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,020
It has nothing to do with health.

515
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,620
Dong Cheng.

516
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,220
Let me tell you something.

517
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,220
In the hospital

518
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,420
I found a suspicious person.

519
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,220
How suspicious is he?

520
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,820
With all the equipment.

521
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,020
He has a hat, a mask, a pair of sunglasses.

522
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,420
He's alive.

523
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,420
What if he's protecting himself?

524
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,420
Well...

525
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,220
He's looking for

526
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,220
our medical staff in the hospital.

527
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,620
He said he had a relationship with them.

528
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,620
Well...

529
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,420
Wait.

530
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,020
Hello?

531
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,020
Wait a minute.

532
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,420
I don't have money.

533
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,020
I need more.

534
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,220
Can you promise to return it?

535
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220
I...

536
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,820
I won't talk to you. I'm going to work.

537
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,220
I won't talk to you.

538
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,620
Dong Cheng.

539
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,220
What's going on?

540
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,220
You're here again.

541
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,020
Dong Cheng, listen.

542
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,020
You can't believe this.

543
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,420
It's a scam.

544
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,220
It's not a scam.

545
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,620
How can a young man understand this?

546
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,820
Scams are everywhere now.

547
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,220
You can't...

548
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,420
Dr. Zhao.

549
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,420
Are you going to work?

550
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,620
Yes. I'm going to work.

551
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,820
Go.

552
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,820
Hurry up.

553
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,020
I'm going to work.

554
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,820
Sit down.

555
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,220
Okay.

556
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,220
Sit.

557
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,820
Sorry.

558
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,420
Are you done?

559
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,420
Go change.

560
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Okay.

561
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,020
Let's go.

562
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,820
I'm off work.

563
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,620
I'm off work.

564
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,620
Bye.

565
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,820
Hello.

566
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,620
What?

567
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,420
Hi, I'm here.

568
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,020
It's me.

569
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,820
Is the phone broken?

570
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,620
It fell off.

571
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,020
What's wrong with you?

572
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,820
Is it the screw problem?

573
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,620
Baby.

574
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,620
I'm off work.

575
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,220
Okay.

576
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
I'll go back now.

577
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,820
Then try again.

578
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,220
I told you.

579
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,420
Just change it all.

580
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,820
You should have changed it.

581
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,620
I have something to do.

582
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,620
I'm leaving now.

583
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,620
I'll go with you.

584
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,820
Hello, Yi Yi.

585
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Do you know who I am?

586
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,020
I'll ask my dad to take Nansha back.

587
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,420
Okay.

588
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,620
I'll go to see you in a few days.

589
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,220
Okay.

590
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,820
I'll ask someone to fix it.

591
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,820
Okay, I got it.

592
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,020
I got it.

593
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,620
I heard it.

594
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,220
I'll go to Mr. Shi's house later.

595
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,620
After that, if your mom doesn't sleep,

596
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,620
I'll go to your house to fix it.

597
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,620
What time?

598
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,420
Wait and see.

599
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,220
Try to go.

600
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,020
Take care of Director Yu.

601
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,620
Zhao Dongcheng.

602
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,420
You know my mom is...

603
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,020
I'll go.

604
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,620
I'll fix it.

605
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
Are you sure?

606
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,220
I didn't say anything about fixing it.

607
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,620
I can fix anything.

608
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,620
Okay, let's go.

609
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,020
You have to push it.

610
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,820
This is made of stone.

611
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,620
You see, it's still jade.

612
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,620
Dad, am I your biological father?

613
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,820
How can you do this to me?

614
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,820
How dare you buy this in my name

615
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,420
and put it on me?

616
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,620
If the other lady sees this,

617
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,420
your son will not be able to see the sun tomorrow.

618
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,420
I've already had a meal with the old lady.

619
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,820
I'm not leaving tonight.

620
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,420
I'll sleep on the bathroom bed.

621
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,820
We can feel it.

622
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,620
I'll definitely see the sun tomorrow morning.

623
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,220
Dad, look at your head.

624
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,820
Enough.

625
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,820
I'll go tell my mom now.

626
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,620
I'll tell her that I'm the victim.

627
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,020
I was forced to accept this broken wall and put it here.

628
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,820
And I'll tell her that her husband

629
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,420
illegally occupied a private place.

630
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:41,820
I'll go.

631
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,620
Come back.

632
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,820
Don't go.

633
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,620
Dad.

634
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,620
Dad.

635
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,420
The boss said that this is a disease of the brain.

636
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,020
High blood pressure, high blood pressure.

637
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,220
If you have a high blood pressure,

638
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,820
you'll be fine in a day.

639
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,420
Why are you asking me?

640
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,620
Why do you want to go to the hospital?

641
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,420
I'll lose my job then.

642
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,820
Let me go.

643
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,420
No, let me go.

644
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,220
Let me go.

645
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,820
Dad.

646
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,020
Is it okay?

647
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,020
It's okay.

648
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,820
I'll get another...

649
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,220
Yes, yes.

650
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,620
I'll get a cross-shaped screw.

651
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,020
Be careful.

652
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,420
Enough, mom.

653
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,020
Stop looking.

654
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,620
It's not something expensive.

655
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,820
It's just a door.

656
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,020
Let's go.

657
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,020
It's not something expensive.

658
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,620
Your grandma bought it for me.

659
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,420
How do you know?

660
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,620
She's so crazy.

661
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,220
So there must be a man in this family, right?

662
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,220
I'll find one for you tomorrow.

663
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,220
How dare you laugh at me?

664
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,820
Let me tell you.

665
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,620
I've been punished enough for so many years.

666
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,620
This man has long given up.

667
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,620
Then go find Uncle Liu to dance tomorrow.

668
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,220
Go.

669
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,620
I'll go.

670
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,420
What's going on?

671
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,220
You've been standing here for half an hour.

672
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,620
Come down if you can't fix it.

673
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,620
Okay.

674
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,220
This is the last one.

675
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,020
You...

676
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,620
Let me do it.

677
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,820
I'll do it.

678
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,820
Director,

679
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,420
you're a big shot.

680
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,420
You're still the main character.

681
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,220
This is Prince Wang Qiu.

682
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,220
He's popular.

683
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,820
He's so popular.

684
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,820
Director,

685
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,420
why are all your papers signed by Zhao?

686
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,820
That's Zhao Dong Cheng's masterpiece.

687
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,020
He wrote it?

688
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,420
When your brother was in school,

689
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,420
he had a special skill.

690
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,020
He was very good at imitating other people's signatures.

691
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,820
At first,

692
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,220
he only signed his dad's name on the paper.

693
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,820
Then he developed to help Liu Jin.

694
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,820
Then the people in his class

695
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,220
were all waiting for his signature.

696
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,820
The teacher didn't know it at first.

697
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,620
But one day, he suddenly changed the paper

698
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,820
and said he would take it back and re-sign.

699
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,020
But your brother was so stupid

700
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,620
that he signed a bunch of his dad's names on my paper.

701
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,220
The teacher only found out about it.

702
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,820
The teacher didn't find out.

703
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,220
Neither did Zhao.

704
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,020
You never go to parent's meetings.

705
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,220
How do you know you have to sign on the paper?

706
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,420
Your brother never told you

707
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,820
how he and his dad lived, right?

708
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,620
Never.

709
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,020
You can ask him.

710
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,620
Okay.

711
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,620
Teacher Zhao.

712
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,420
Teacher Zhao.

713
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,420
You're here.

714
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,220
You're leaving too?

715
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,420
Dr. Zhao.

716
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,820
I'll take a walk after dinner.

717
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,020
We'll go out for a walk after dinner.

718
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,420
Is it cold?

719
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,620
Not cold.

720
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,420
Not cold?

721
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,220
Do you feel better?

722
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,020
I'm fine.

723
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,620
I'm fine.

724
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,620
Do you have an appetite?

725
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,220
I still can't eat.

726
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,620
What did you eat today?

727
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,820
I just had some porridge.

728
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,620
It's okay.

729
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,620
Just take a rest.

730
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,620
Yes.

731
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,420
You have a good attitude.

732
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,220
I always tell you.

733
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,020
Don't get cold.

734
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,420
Gui.

735
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,820
Stay here with grandpa.

736
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,620
Okay.

737
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,620
Do you miss me?

738
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,220
Do you miss me?

739
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,620
6th year.

740
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,420
6th year.

741
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,020
Hello, Dr. Wang.

742
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,620
I'm Shen.

743
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,620
Is Chen Gang here?

744
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,220
Okay.

745
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,420
Poison.

746
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,620
The pain is normal.

747
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,620
Poison is hot.

748
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,420
30,000. 30,000 again?

749
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,820
How many times can I think of you?

750
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,620
You're so anxious.

751
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,620
Okay.

752
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,220
Okay.

753
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,420
Okay.

754
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,220
Okay.

755
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,020
Okay.

756
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,820
Okay.

757
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,420
Okay.

758
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,620
Okay.

759
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,820
Okay.

760
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,820
I believe you for the last time.

761
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,020
You have to promise me.

762
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,220
You can move me here this time.

763
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,220
Okay.

764
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,620
I'm hanging up.

765
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,820
Hey,

766
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,420
Lin, you...

767
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,820
It's useful to bring this with you.

768
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,620
It's comfortable.

769
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,820
You can lie down like this.

770
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,020
Forget it. I'm just sleeping.

771
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,220
Dr. Zhang, 6th year.

772
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,820
Dong Cheng.

773
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,820
Zhao Dong Cheng was cheated.

774
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,220
Really?

775
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,020
Gui Lin.

776
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,820
When he called others,

777
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,420
I heard that the money wasn't enough.

778
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,420
Today, he called others again.

779
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,820
He said 30,000 and 30,000.

780
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,020
He even asked if he could make money back.

781
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,220
No, Lin.

782
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,820
I asked Zhao to borrow 300, but he didn't.

783
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,820
Don't joke.

784
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,420
Let me tell you.

785
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,220
Zhang Dong Cheng must have been cheated.

786
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,820
Killing sign.

787
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,020
Telephone fraud.

788
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,220
This is possible in the whole country.

789
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,820
Lin, don't be suspicious.

790
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,420
How can it be so easy to cheat someone?

791
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,620
No, Dr. Zhang.

792
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,420
It's not impossible.

793
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,620
But Lin,

794
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,820
where's the evidence?

795
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,020
We can't just believe you.

796
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,220
Do you have evidence?

797
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,020
And it's meaningless to cheat Zhao.

798
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,420
He doesn't have money, right?

799
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,620
Yes.

800
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,620
Then, you can observe again.

801
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,020
Tell us if you need anything.

802
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,620
I have something to do in the office. I'll go first.

803
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,820
Dr. Zhang, come.

804
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,220
I've thought of it.

805
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,220
I've thought of this suspect.

806
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,620
This suspect is wearing sunglasses

807
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,820
and sneaking around the door.

808
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,820
Isn't he a thief?

809
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,020
Dr. Zhang, sign here.

810
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,620
Okay.

811
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,220
Have you finished?

812
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,820
Lin, continue.

813
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,420
Go back to your work.

814
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,820
Isn't he a thief?

815
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,420
You came to the hospital

816
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,420
and asked about our male doctor and nurse.

817
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,420
Isn't it Zhao Dong Cheng and you?

818
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,020
I've observed these days.

819
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
Zhao Dong Cheng is a little strange.

820
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,220
When he came,

821
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,420
Zhao Dong Cheng was screaming

822
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,420
for money.

823
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,020
What a coincidence.

824
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,820
He said that his family's child

825
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,020
was a lie.

826
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,820
He must be a liar.

827
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,220
He must be a liar.

828
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,220
Thank you, Yang Laolin.

829
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,420
Thank you.

830
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,620
Keep observing us.

831
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,620
If you find anything wrong,

832
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,620
tell us in time.

833
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,820
Okay?

834
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,620
I have something to do in the office.

835
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,020
I'll go first.

836
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,620
Remember to tell us.

837
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,220
Thank you.

838
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,820
Brother Jun, Dr. Zhang, say something.

839
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,420
Are you still friends?

840
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,420
You're not friends?

841
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,620
This bastard.

842
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,620
Last time, he said that he bought a knife and a stone.

843
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,220
Why is he still so self-righteous?

844
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,820
What is this?

845
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,020
He's just wasting money.

846
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,820
Shen Xixi!

847
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,420
Shen Xixi!

848
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,220
Shen Xixi!

849
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,020
What is this?

850
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,820
He buys so many express delivery everyday.

851
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,220
3800?

852
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,820
He just buys this.

853
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,620
Buyers.

854
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,220
Shen Cunzheng.

855
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,620
Shen Cunzheng!

856
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,820
This old man.

857
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,420
Shen Cunzheng!

858
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,020
Shen Cunzheng!

859
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,420
Look.

860
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,020
3800.

861
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,220
He just buys this.

862
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,820
It's heavy and has a lot of space.

863
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,820
It's heavy and has a lot of space.

864
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,820
He can't even throw it away.

865
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,820
This is not only 3800.

866
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,820
I think 38000 is worth it.

867
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,020
38000?

868
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,220
Take a discount.

869
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,820
I'll sell you 10,000.

870
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,420
It can even cure your illness.

871
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,420
Lying on the bed,

872
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,620
you'll get sick even if you're not sick.

873
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,620
I say, my dead wife has a mental illness.

874
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,820
So many big houses.

875
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,420
You can just find a house to sleep in.

876
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,220
If you lose it,

877
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,820
3800 will be a pain in the neck.

878
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,220
I can't even move it.

879
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,420
If anyone helps me,

880
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,020
I can give him some money.

881
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,220
Two men in the family are so mean.

882
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,220
I can't wait to deal with them together.

883
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:08,820
Sit down.

884
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,420
Okay.

885
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,420
Congratulations.

886
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,420
You six are like our Yuan Yuan and You Shen.

887
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,020
You can have it.

888
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,820
What would you like to buy?

889
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,620
Get me the cheapest one.

890
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,420
This man looks familiar.

891
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,420
Sister, I heard you have a sofa.

892
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,420
Do you want to sell it?

893
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,220
What sofa?

894
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,220
Take a look.

895
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,020
Look.

896
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,220
The quality is good.

897
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:37,820
It's good.

898
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,420
How much is it?

899
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,620
Of course it's 10,000.

900
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,220
If you want it,

901
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,220
3800.

902
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,820
Just give me 3800.

903
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,820
3800.

904
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,420
If I sell it to you,

905
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,820
how much will you charge?

906
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,020
I told you.

907
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,620
You can give me 3800.

908
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,820
It's okay if you sell it well.

909
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,020
Okay.

910
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,020
Can you give me a card?

911
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,420
I almost forgot.

912
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,820
This is my card.

913
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,620
Just call me.

914
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,420
Okay.

915
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,020
Don't forget it.

916
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,820
Leave it to me.

917
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,020
Okay.

918
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,620
Take care.

919
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,420
Okay.

920
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,620
You gave him the 30000?

921
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,820
Do you want it?

922
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,820
You're so stingy.

923
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,420
I don't want it.

924
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:16,820
You're so mean.

925
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,420
What do you want to say?

926
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Come on.

927
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,620
We're here.

928
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,020
The fish is swimming.

929
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,220
Come in.

930
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,220
Okay.

931
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,420
Zhang Yiyi.

932
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,420
Do you miss me?

933
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,420
Yes.

934
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,620
You're lying.

935
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,420
You miss my high-heeled dog.

936
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,820
Why do you clean it?

937
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,820
You're here.

938
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,020
Clean it.

939
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,020
Why are you so lazy?

940
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,020
Zhang Yiyi.

941
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,020
What are you doing?

942
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,020
Yiyi.

943
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,020
What are you holding?

944
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,420
Yiyi.

945
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,420
Take a picture for you two.

946
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,620
What did I say, Zhang?

947
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,420
Dad.

948
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,620
Milk is made of milk.

949
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Snow cake is also made of milk.

950
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,420
But why can't we eat

951
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,220
snow cake when we can drink milk?

952
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,220
Because milk is warm.

953
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,420
Snow cake is cold.

954
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,620
I told you.

955
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,420
It's not good to eat cold.

956
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,420
Where is the ice cream?

957
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,420
The ice cream is melted.

958
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,820
The ice cream is hot.

959
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,820
I can't help you.

960
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
No.

961
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,820
I want to eat it.

962
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,820
Let's go.

963
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,220
Don't move.

964
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,420
What are you doing?

965
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,820
Why are you smiling so happily?

966
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,420
You're smiling, right?

967
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,420
You eat this.

968
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,420
I'll give you this.

969
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,020
You're not here.

970
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,020
You eat the little dragon's duck.

971
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,420
Is it good?

972
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,420
It's spicy.

973
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,420
It's spicy.

974
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,820
Thank you, director.

975
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,020
You're welcome.

976
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,620
You're too thin.

977
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,020
Eat more.

978
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,420
Next time you come to my house again,

979
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,020
tell me.

980
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,620
You're too thin.

981
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,020
Eat more.

982
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,620
Did you say director?

983
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,820
Did you use the book?

984
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,220
Yes.

985
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,220
Good.

986
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,620
They were right.

987
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,620
This kind of gift is the most practical.

988
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,420
I just used it up.

989
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,020
Thank you, director.

990
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,620
This is a fox's tail.

991
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,020
Come on.

992
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,620
Give me a fox's tail.

993
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,020
Come on.

994
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,820
Look at Jun.

995
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,620
You too.

996
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,820
Let's play a game.

997
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,820
This is the front.

998
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,820
This is the back.

999
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,420
I'm right, Zhao Dengcheng.

1000
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,220
You're doing this again.

1001
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,420
Anyway, no matter what,

1002
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,620
every time it's the back.

1003
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,020
Every time it's the back.

1004
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,620
Just a process.

1005
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,420
What can't be decided this time?

1006
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,620
You have to use the coin.

1007
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,020
It's a very important thing.

1008
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,420
But I can't lose now.

1009
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,220
The front or the back?

1010
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,820
The front.

1011
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,820
Brother Liu, stop talking.

1012
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,820
Let's not talk about this.

1013
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,820
Okay?

1014
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,820
Let me see.

1015
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,020
You're so good at talking.

1016
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
Did you spend money

1017
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,420
at home?

1018
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,020
This is for my relatives.

1019
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,620
I won't sell it.

1020
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,420
Your relatives are not at home.

1021
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,420
It's a waste to spend money at home.

1022
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,820
Who knows if this is a lie?

1023
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,220
You're talking too badly.

1024
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,020
I'm not here to sell the sofa.

1025
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,620
Right?

1026
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,620
You said

1027
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,820
you were sick.

1028
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,820
You said you were sick

1029
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,620
from dizziness.

1030
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,420
I was sick too.

1031
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,420
You insisted on asking me

1032
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,220
why I'm so healthy.

1033
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,220
You insisted on asking me, right?

1034
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,620
Right, brother?

1035
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,420
If I didn't have this jade sofa,

1036
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,620
I wouldn't be able to get up now.

1037
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,620
What's this?

1038
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,820
This jade sofa

1039
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,020
is not something you can buy

1040
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,020
if you want to.

1041
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,420
It's a big stone

1042
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,620
and it's also effective.

1043
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,620
Where can you find it?

1044
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,020
In this jade stone mountain,

1045
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,620
you can find

1046
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,820
at most two or three pieces.

1047
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,020
Why is it so rare?

1048
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,220
What's the biggest difference

1049
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,820
between this jade sofa and ordinary sofa?

1050
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,020
Why?

1051
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,020
You look at it hard

1052
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,220
but when you lie on the bed,

1053
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,820
it's like lying on the bed

1054
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,020
and feeling the same.

1055
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,220
Oh my god.

1056
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,420
I'm so moved.

1057
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,220
Don't be moved.

1058
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,020
Play cards quickly.

1059
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,820
I'll leave after this round.

1060
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,620
Okay?

1061
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,220
How much is it?

1062
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,620
It's not about money.

1063
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,420
If you don't sell it,

1064
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,420
you can put a price first.

1065
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,020
What if your relative

1066
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,820
doesn't buy it?

1067
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,020
Someone will buy it from us.

1068
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,620
Right?

1069
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,020
We won't let you suffer.

1070
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,020
Right.

1071
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,420
If you really want to buy it,

1072
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,620
I'll give you

1073
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,220
a price of 20,000 yuan

1074
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,220
for my relative.

1075
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,420
What she said just now

1076
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,020
is not expensive.

1077
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,020
It's too expensive.

1078
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,820
Where can you find it?

1079
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,220
Just kidding.

1080
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,620
I'll buy it.

1081
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,220
Why are you back?

1082
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,420
I forgot to take the medicine.

1083
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,220
Okay.

1084
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,620
Dad.

1085
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,020
What?

1086
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,820
Wait for me.

1087
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,620
I'm leaving.

1088
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,220
I'll go to the bathroom.

1089
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,420
Liu Qing, remember it.

1090
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,620
He's always like this.

1091
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,820
He's not smart.

1092
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:34,820
Take it off.

1093
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,620
I'm using that.

1094
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,620
You don't have to take it off.

1095
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,620
I'll do it myself.

1096
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,220
I just sleep for a while.

1097
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,620
I'm a clean body.

1098
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,820
Have you heard that

1099
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,020
someone in our community was cheated?

1100
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,020
Who?

1101
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,820
I don't know.

1102
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,020
Gong Tiaoge said that

1103
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,420
when this person transferred his money,

1104
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,220
he thought he was his relative.

1105
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,220
But he found out he was a liar.

1106
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,220
It seems that he has a lot of experience of being cheated.

1107
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,420
Now the cheater is great.

1108
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,020
His skills are getting more and more brilliant.

1109
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,420
So you have to be very careful.

1110
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,020
After all, you don't look very smart.

1111
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,620
What do you mean?

1112
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,820
Especially your bad eye-catching glasses.

1113
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,820
You'll be even more stupid if you wear them.

1114
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,820
You're the most stupid.

1115
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,620
You brat.

1116
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,820
Dad.

1117
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,820
Dad.

1118
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,220
Dad, where are you?

1119
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,620
Did you see my dad?

1120
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,420
He said he was here.

1121
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,620
Uncle is in the infirmary.

1122
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,620
Okay, thank you.

1123
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,820
I don't have anything to do.

1124
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,820
You don't have to call the doctor.

1125
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,620
Let's go to the police station to solve this matter.

1126
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,620
Liu Qing,

1127
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,420
he's the one who brought the police.

1128
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,220
He's been locked up for his whole life.

1129
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,220
Stupid dad.

1130
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,820
Dad, where are you hurt?

1131
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,020
Let me see.

1132
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,020
It's okay.

1133
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,020
Sit down first.

1134
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,020
The doctor will deal with the wound.

1135
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,020
Okay.

1136
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,020
Let's go.

1137
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,020
I don't have anything to do.

1138
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,020
What do you want to deal with?

1139
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,020
I can't balance it.

1140
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,020
Go.

1141
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,420
What's wrong with you?

1142
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,420
My mom has to divorce you again.

1143
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
What divorce?

1144
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,820
I'm pretty good to your mom.

1145
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,020
What's wrong with you recently?

1146
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,220
What's wrong with me?

1147
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,020
This is a scam.

1148
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,620
I tell you,

1149
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,820
sell your chair in the room to me.

1150
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,820
How does he know you have a chair?

1151
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,820
How does he know you have a chair?

1152
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,620
He stole your bed.

1153
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,620
Then we're in the thief.

1154
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,020
I have to tell him.

1155
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,020
No, no, no.

1156
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,820
It's not a thief.

1157
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,820
It's a liar.

1158
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,420
The bathroom sofa in the room,

1159
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,220
he actually took me to the door of the room.

1160
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,420
He said he would sell it to me.

1161
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,420
What are you talking about?

1162
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,620
What do you mean sell your sofa to you?

1163
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,020
You've messed up with me.

1164
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,620
You can't explain it clearly.

1165
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,820
Comrades,

1166
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,020
solve this matter immediately.

1167
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,420
Yes, sir.

1168
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,220
Wait until the wound is treated.

1169
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,020
Let's go to the police station to solve it.

1170
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,220
Have you informed your family?

1171
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,220
I'm asking you.

1172
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,620
Have you informed your family?

1173
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,820
Who?

1174
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,220
Have you informed your wife and children?

1175
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,020
No.

1176
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,820
No wife and children?

1177
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,420
Then you can tell your relatives.

1178
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
No.

1179
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,620
Me.

1180
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,020
I'm his son.

1181
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,420
Xiao Xu.

1182
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,420
The matter is solved.

1183
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,220
Uncle and aunt left first.

1184
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,020
It's all a misunderstanding.

1185
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,020
Nothing serious.

1186
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,820
You haven't seen each other for a long time.

1187
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,220
Have a good chat.

1188
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,620
Call Zhao Dongcheng to take you to aunt's house to eat some day.

1189
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,820
OK.

1190
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,820
Uncle and aunt, take care.

1191
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,220
OK.

1192
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,820
Thank you.

1193
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,020
It's lucky that you took care of Xiao Xu these days.

1194
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,620
I really can't get rid of you

1195
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,820
because of business.

1196
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,220
Thank you.

1197
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,420
Don't be fake.

1198
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,220
Go.

1199
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:34,820
Xiao Xu.

1200
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,020
Don't touch me.

1201
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,020
Your father

1202
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,620
was fooled by others

1203
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,220
by accident.

1204
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,620
Now it's all solved.

1205
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,620
Don't worry.

1206
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,620
Your father has many friends in the business.

1207
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,420
They all came to help me.

1208
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,420
All solved?

1209
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,620
So fast?

1210
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,220
Why did you trick me here?

1211
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,820
Son.

1212
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,020
I have no choice.

1213
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,020
I can only bring you here.

1214
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,420
I think

1215
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,420
you have a good relationship.

1216
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,420
Stop lying.

1217
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,220
You just want to run away.

1218
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,020
You were forced to do this.

1219
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,420
You want to run away.

1220
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,820
You are a big liar.

1221
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,220
Xiao Xu.

1222
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,820
You didn't recognize me just now.

1223
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,020
Now I don't recognize you.

1224
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,020
I'm not a liar like you.

1225
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,020
Are you going or not?

1226
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,020
Guang Xu.

1227
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,820
Guang Xu.

1228
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,220
I know. I'm coming.

1229
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,220
Liu Jin and the others are here.

1230
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,820
The restaurant is not bad.

1231
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,220
You can try it later.

1232
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,220
Okay.

1233
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,820
I think it's scary.

1234
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,420
It's so hot.

1235
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,020
Guang Xu's stepfather

1236
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,620
is a character.

1237
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,220
He is good-tempered.

1238
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,420
He is like a boss.

1239
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,020
He is very talkative.

1240
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,220
Many people want to buy this sofa.

1241
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,620
I took it.

1242
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,220
You took it.

1243
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,420
You can have it.

1244
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,820
You can say it.

1245
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,020
He said it very well.

1246
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,020
His sofa

1247
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,420
is much better than my sofa

1248
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,620
in the past.

1249
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,620
I'll take it.

1250
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,020
So annoying.

1251
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,020
Where? Where?

1252
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,820
You are like this.

1253
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,420
You want to fight with others.

1254
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,820
Come.

1255
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,620
Use this.

1256
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,220
It's so light.

1257
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,220
I'm a liar.

1258
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,020
Am I guilty?

1259
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,220
He asked me for 20,000 yuan.

1260
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,820
I gave you 38,000 yuan.

1261
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,620
He is trying to cheat you.

1262
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,820
He can cheat others.

1263
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,220
But he can't cheat you.

1264
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,820
I just took the 38,000 yuan

1265
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,820
from your sofa.

1266
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,620
What's the profit?

1267
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,420
So you only want 38,000 yuan.

1268
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,420
Your sofa

1269
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,020
is 38,000 yuan.

1270
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,420
38,000 yuan.

1271
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,620
38,000 yuan.

1272
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,820
How can it be 38,000 yuan?

1273
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,220
How can it be 38,000 yuan?

1274
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,820
You bought such a stupid sofa.

1275
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,420
You…

1276
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,620
You are dead now.

1277
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,420
Stop.

1278
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,820
You are so bad.

1279
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,020
You are so bad.

1280
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,220
You are so dead.

1281
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,420
I'm telling you.

1282
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,820
The doctor said

1283
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,820
you are so bad.

1284
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,220
You are so bad.

1285
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,220
Dad.

1286
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,220
You are so bad.

1287
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,020
You bought such a stupid sofa.

1288
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,420
Listen to me.

1289
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,020
They said it was a kind of toxic.

1290
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,620
It's a disease.

1291
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,020
He asked a chicken.

1292
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,420
This bullfrog is very delicious.

1293
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,220
You are a special fish.

1294
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,420
You don't eat it, do you?

1295
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,020
Wait a minute.

1296
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,020
Okay, thank you.

1297
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,620
I'll eat this bullfrog.

1298
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,020
Which one do you want?

1299
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:36,820
Dad.

1300
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,420
Thank you.

1301
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,420
I'll give you some.

1302
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,220
Thank you.

1303
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,420
You are welcome.

1304
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:43,820
I'm telling you.

1305
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,220
You are welcome.

1306
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,020
Here comes the big dish.

1307
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,020
This dish

1308
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,220
is the specialty of their family.

1309
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:53,820
I'm telling you.

1310
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,220
If you don't eat this dish when you come to the store,

1311
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,020
you'll come for nothing.

1312
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,620
Is there a promotion in your store?

1313
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,020
No.

1314
00:48:59,020 --> 00:48:59,820
I just think it's delicious.

1315
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:00,820
So I introduce it to you.

1316
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,620
I think you are too enthusiastic today.

1317
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,820
How is it? Is it good?

1318
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,820
I want to try this beef.

1319
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,020
Thank you.

1320
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,420
Wait a minute before eating.

1321
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,020
My phone is out of battery.

1322
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,420
Can you lend me a charger?

1323
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,220
Thank you.

1324
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,020
You are welcome.

1325
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,220
Why do you always ask others to help you with this and that?

1326
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,620
No.

1327
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,620
My brother has such a dad.

1328
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,420
What kind of luck does he have?

1329
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,220
He

1330
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,620
came here because his dad didn't pay him.

1331
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,420
Yes.

1332
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,820
He is irresponsible.

1333
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,420
No.

1334
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,220
They don't have blood relations.

1335
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,220
So the relationship is broken.

1336
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,220
But it's true.

1337
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:50,820
After so many years,

1338
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,620
you should have some feelings.

1339
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,620
After so many years,

1340
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,620
I feel sorry for him.

1341
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,220
How can he come here after so many years?

1342
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,220
Do you think he will suddenly...

1343
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,220
Enough.

1344
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,020
He knows his own business.

1345
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,820
It's useless to talk about it here.

1346
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,220
And some people don't deserve to be a father.

1347
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,020
You shouldn't have feelings for a scumbag.

1348
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,820
You are right.

1349
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,820
I agree with this.

1350
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,220
You mean Mr. Yu's father who cheated, right?

1351
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:18,820
Yes.

1352
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,220
Why can't Liu Jin stop you from eating?

1353
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,820
Liu Jin.

1354
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,820
That's delicious.

1355
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,020
Sorry. I won't say it. I'll eat it.

1356
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,020
Shut up.

1357
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,220
You are sitting here alone.

1358
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,420
Are you full?

1359
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:45,820
Yes.

1360
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,220
Everyone is giving me food.

1361
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,820
I know he is not a thing.

1362
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,620
Since he was a kid,

1363
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,620
he has been doing business

1364
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,220
and I don't know how many schools he has changed.

1365
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,220
Every time I get familiar with the environment,

1366
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,620
we have to leave.

1367
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,820
And there is another funny thing.

1368
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,820
When I started school,

1369
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,020
he forgot to send me to school.

1370
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,620
The next day,

1371
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,020
he woke me up at 5 a.m.

1372
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,820
I stayed in school for two hours in the morning.

1373
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,020
Then the school opened.

1374
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:27,820
He likes to play mahjong.

1375
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,420
I ate at the mahjong hall.

1376
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,820
When I was thirsty, he gave me a beer.

1377
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,420
He introduced his girlfriend to him.

1378
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,420
He thought he was a burden.

1379
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,220
He should have agreed

1380
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,420
and dumped me.

1381
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,020
My mom passed away.

1382
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,820
I have nothing to do with him.

1383
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,620
I think you should meet and talk.

1384
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,220
What should I do?

1385
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,420
I told him

1386
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,220
I forgive you.

1387
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,420
Don't worry.

1388
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,420
He was happy

1389
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,220
and left.

1390
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,220
I am helping you to analyze.

1391
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,820
We have lived together for so many years.

1392
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,420
I am afraid you will regret it.

1393
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,220
You are not me.

1394
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,020
Why do you help me analyze?

1395
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,220
Is he your dad?

1396
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,220
Did he abandon you?

1397
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,020
Why do you say you forgive him?

1398
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,820
Because I see you now.

1399
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,020
I think of myself.

1400
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,920
Because I saw you quarreling with Guan Shan.

1401
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,620
I think of what I said before.

1402
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,020
If time can turn back,

1403
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,020
I hope you can forget about it.

1404
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,020
If I could turn back time,

1405
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,780
I hope I could be patient

1406
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,780
and listen to what dad wants to say.

1407
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,700
After you left,

1408
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,140
dad was lying in the hotel every day.

1409
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,060
I barely saw him

1410
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,660
wake up for more than eight hours.

1411
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,580
I blamed all your leaving

1412
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,100
on him.

1413
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,780
We rarely met.

1414
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,420
We quarreled every time.

1415
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,380
I also told him

1416
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,260
I didn't want to have a father like you.

1417
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,300
He was already a man

1418
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,540
when he graduated from college.

1419
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:15,700
A year.

1420
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,060
Oh,

1421
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,060
I was really a man.

1422
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,740
We didn't say much to each other.

1423
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,260
Then he left.

1424
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,140
On the first day after he left,

1425
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:51,740
I...

1426
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,560
I became

1427
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,020
think of him by himself

1428
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,420
because of golbaeng.

1429
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,280
It felt great.

1430
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,340
I couldn't get by alone.

1431
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,780
But we had a good time drinking.

1432
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,060
and suddenly,

1433
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,860
I realized

1434
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:18,580
I don't know.

1435
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,900
It's not just praise,

1436
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,460
anger,

1437
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,540
and hate.

1438
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,540
There are many more.

1439
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:34,700
So?

1440
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,260
Is he a good father?

1441
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,260
He is a good father now.

1442
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,060
People

1443
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,820
can't be perfect.

1444
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:47,780
Right?

1445
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,660
It's a fire.

1446
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,740
It's not a joke.

1447
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,420
It's impossible to be so clear.

1448
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,300
I don't understand.

1449
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,620
Why can't they be good fathers?

1450
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,340
Only you I'm happy for

1451
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,660
back home.

1452
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,500
Only you I'm happy for

1453
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,380
manaaa

1454
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,620
why

1455
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:31,620
This time,

1456
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,220
my tears

1457
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,560
dry up

1458
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,160
and

1459
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,360
the barely- roster

1460
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,660
it's my own policy.

1461
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,660
You made the mistake.

1462
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,660
Then tell me,

1463
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,660
should I forgive him?

1464
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,660
How about this?

1465
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,660
You're throwing hard coins again.

1466
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,660
We've finished our meal.

1467
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,660
What are you saying? Let's go home?

1468
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,660
What else?

1469
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,660
You have another event.

1470
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,660
I'm not going to attend.

1471
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,660
I'm going back to bring my kid.

1472
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:19,660
Look,

1473
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,660
my daughter is so funny now.

1474
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,660
Every time she sees something she likes on the Internet,

1475
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,660
she sends me a link

1476
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,660
and I buy it for her.

1477
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,660
What is this?

1478
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,660
This should be...

1479
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,660
Chen Ke,

1480
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,660
I didn't expect you to be so friendly.

1481
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,660
Self-respect.

1482
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:43,660
Self-respect.

1483
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,660
No, let me explain.

1484
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:16,660
I'm sorry.

1485
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,660
I'm sorry.

1486
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,660
I'm sorry.

1487
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:19,660
I'm sorry.

1488
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,660
I'm sorry.

1489
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,660
I'm sorry.

1490
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,660
I'm sorry.

1491
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,660
I'm sorry.

1492
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,660
I'm sorry.

1493
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,660
I'm sorry.

1494
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,660
I'm sorry.

1495
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,660
I'm sorry.

1496
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:28,660
I'm sorry.

1497
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,660
I'm sorry.

1498
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,660
I'm sorry.

1499
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,660
I'm sorry.

1500
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,660
I'm sorry.

1501
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:33,660
I'm sorry.

1502
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,660
I'm sorry.

1503
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,660
I'm sorry.

1504
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,660
I'm sorry.

1505
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:37,660
I'm sorry.

1506
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,660
I'm sorry.

1507
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:39,660
I'm sorry.

1508
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:40,660
I'm sorry.

1509
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,660
I'm sorry.

1510
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,660
I'm sorry.

1511
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,660
I'm sorry.

1512
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,660
I'm sorry.

1513
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,660
I'm sorry.

1514
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:46,660
