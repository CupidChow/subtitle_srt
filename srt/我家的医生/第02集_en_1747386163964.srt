00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
Love Satellite

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,500
There is someone out of this city who scared the shit out of you

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,460
If I'm airflow no one's gonna remember man, losing a fan

4
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:47,300
When my tesbo was in yÃ¼zdenue, man

5
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,460
H Face up.

6
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,000
Agriculture coriander spoiled

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,320
The hgeneration bullet

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,320
I'm not a coward

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,040
Who opened the door of the hospital

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,400
The ugly and bitter aunt

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,800
Or the neighbor's little ghost

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,480
I'm here, don't worry, he's talking

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,240
My house is like a ginger water with a little bit of hair

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,600
The big water that is in danger every year

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,160
There is also a big leaf with a white head

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,640
Don't be too aggressive with me

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,840
Don't be too decisive

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,200
Little Chi has your alcohol

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,600
The name of the money can be solved

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,640
I haven't heard it

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,440
I saw it and said it

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,800
The night is like a fan

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,880
The watch is open

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,520
Kneel on the suit and watch the watch

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,640
What is this dog

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,960
Call a friend

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,360
Order a seat and arrive immediately

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,720
Hurry up and hurry up

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,040
There is a new account tomorrow

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,840
I secretly went to Mexico from New York

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,720
You are a dog

32
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,400
Why are you always following me

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,120
Brother, I want to go to the toilet

34
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,560
You just finished

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,320
Why are you going

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
I want to go

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't think you should be called Zhao Xu Yang

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Should be called Zhao Xu Xu

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,640
Brother brother

40
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,200
coming

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,240
Who

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,040
Me

43
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,080
Brother Qing

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,800
How is it

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,120
Wen Dongcheng resigned

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,680
Spring simple

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,080
Packed with clear soup and shredded meat

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,120
Take some fruit

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,560
Thank you, Jun

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,320
Ask him to resign

51
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,680
What's the big deal

52
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,840
Dr. Zheng really can't

53
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,320
Change your bag

54
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,720
Say something wrong at home

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,320
I'm not very convenient to ask for leave

56
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,040
Let's talk about this

57
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,520
OK, then take good care of him

58
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,280
I'll send the doctor first

59
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
See you at the unit later

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,120
Hurry up

61
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,720
See you later

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,520
it is good

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,200
Can you hurry up

64
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,040
Give me my house key

65
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,440
Knock the door again

66
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,400
My mom just cooked porridge

67
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Drink while it's hot

68
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,720
Lighter

69
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,520
I heard you coming and making trouble again

70
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,000
I won't stay here anyway

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,360
Didn't your family say he was coming

72
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,840
I sent a message, so I arrived

73
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm going to be late again

74
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,200
Come on, leave him

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,040
I'm not here

76
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,680
I haven't seen you

77
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,200
You give me what you have

78
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
Give me the stuff

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,720
The stuff is with the doctor

80
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,640
You ask him for it

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,120
I want it now

82
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,320
I go to work in the morning

83
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,400
Will you come back in the afternoon

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,480
Talk now

85
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm going to work now

86
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,680
I found a friend to take care of you

87
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,000
You also found someone

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,080
Come and watch me

89
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,360
You are not feeling well

90
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,680
I found someone to take care of you

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,640
Not watching

92
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,040
coming

93
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,120
I'm here

94
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
I'm here

95
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
I'm here

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
I'm here

97
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
I'm here

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
I'm here

99
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
I'm here

100
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,000
Give me my key

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Don't knock on the door again

102
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,520
Brother

103
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,960
Buns, steamed dumplings, steamed buns

104
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,640
Sweet wine, spring onion, and fried eggs

105
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
You open each one

106
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
How delicious

107
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,120
I see when I'm not feeling well

108
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,720
You didn't bring these to me

109
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Brother

110
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,600
My brother

111
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Brother

112
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
Liu Jin

113
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,120
Call me if you need anything

114
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Good morning, Mr. Fan

115
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Please come to the office of Mr. Fan

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Please come to the office of Mr. Fan

117
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Please come to the office of Mr. Fan

118
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Hello

119
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Hello

120
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Hello

121
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
What happened

122
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
In love

123
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Why are you so heartless?

124
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
When I was in school

125
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
This is the problem

126
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
So many years

127
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Can't change

128
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm sorry

129
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
I'm sorry

130
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
I'm sorry

131
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
I'm sorry

132
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
I'm sorry

133
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
I'm sorry

134
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
You look at me and I look at you

135
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
You love gossip

136
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Compete with the school's good school discipline

137
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
I took a look

138
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Your blood pressure is normal

139
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
No problem

140
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
Where is it uncomfortable

141
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
I just

142
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
You know, I'm not comfortable all over

143
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
What about specific

144
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
I just

145
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
Stomach pain

146
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Stomach pain

147
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Stomach pain

148
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
This stomach is not good

149
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Which kind of pain

150
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
It's just this one anyway

151
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
This one is a good pain

152
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
It hurts

153
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,120
It's just painful

154
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
It hurts every time

155
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
It's always so painful

156
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
It hurts every day

157
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
It hurts every day

158
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Anyway, it's always so old

159
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
So uncomfortable

160
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
When did it start

161
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
When

162
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Last week

163
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,120
I feel this heart is beating

164
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
I can't eat anymore

165
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
It hurts when I eat

166
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
It hurts even if I don't eat at all

167
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
I'm not here

168
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Is there something growing

169
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Is it cancer

170
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
I haven't seen it yet

171
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Don't talk nonsense

172
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
You said if it grows

173
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
You said I'm so old

174
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Can it still be opened

175
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
I'll show you

176
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Look at that

177
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Brother

178
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Are you sure you don't eat these things

179
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
These are all very delicious

180
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Very delicious

181
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
I don't think so

182
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
You are like this

183
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
It's not a thing

184
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
The more you are like this

185
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
The more difficult it is to let you out

186
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Otherwise I'll give you a trick

187
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
You and him

188
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,160
Three

189
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
He's been attacked by you

190
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,120
Married

191
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
He is the typical one

192
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Say a few more good words

193
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Call a brother

194
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Isn't this solved?

195
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Isn't Dr. Shen here this morning?

196
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
Dr. Shen is not here this morning

197
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Didn't you make an appointment

198
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,120
Didn't talk to Liu Jing

199
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
It was also her

200
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Suddenly feel uncomfortable

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
We just came

202
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
That's it

203
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
I'll arrange another doctor for you

204
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
Our doctors are all pretty good

205
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
I don't know if she is willing

206
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
I'll pick one for you

207
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Ruihua

208
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Ruihua

209
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
Don't run around

210
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
I'm so big

211
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Are you afraid of me

212
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
Brother

213
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
This video is very interesting

214
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
How many WeChat do you have? I'll teach you

215
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
I send you

216
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
I don't play WeChat

217
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,120
Are you thirsty or hungry?

218
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
Unreliable

219
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,120
Don't ask me

220
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
Why are you taking that

221
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Don't

222
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Talk to me like you talk to your brother

223
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Can you talk to your brother?

224
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,120
You come out and talk for a while

225
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
You know me

226
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Let's get to know each other deeply

227
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,120
You still know how good your brother is

228
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
How kind-hearted

229
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Are your brothers

230
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Did you take Mr. Yu to the hospital?

231
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
I can go to the hospital at any time

232
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Get it back for you

233
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
If you need anything

234
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
You tell me

235
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
I'll help you

236
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
Lao Zhong

237
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm resting today

238
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
I'm helping my friend

239
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
That can't be helped

240
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
Who wants me to be so attractive?

241
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
And the ability is so strong

242
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Little Ruihua, let her get a bowl of steamed clothes

243
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
OK, hang up

244
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
Brother

245
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
You have to remember your six brothers

246
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
I'm so tired

247
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm full

248
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Come

249
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Spider Man

250
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
I'm not

251
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
I'm not

252
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
I'm not

253
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
I'm not

254
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Little boy

255
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
I made a mistake

256
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Never learn

257
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Ma Yi Deng

258
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
I can think of you

259
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,120
He just came down the window

260
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
Doctor

261
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
You will contact him later

262
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,120
This is our mouth hospital

263
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Doctor's number

264
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
You come to our superior hospital

265
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Do a more comprehensive inspection

266
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Okay

267
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
No, no

268
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,560
I'll just take it.

269
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,240
You don't have to treat yourself.

270
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,840
It's not good to do a full-face examination.

271
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
Give me your uncle's phone number.

272
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
Or you can send it to me.

273
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,040
Okay?

274
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,520
What do you mean?

275
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Am I already

276
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,600
informed of my family?

277
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,040
No.

278
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,840
You haven't done a full-face examination.

279
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,000
You're talking nonsense.

280
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,160
Dr. Zhao.

281
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,680
Sister Lei.

282
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,040
You must be a thief.

283
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,640
I want to eat a chicken.

284
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,360
I want to eat a chicken.

285
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,720
You've already eaten a piece.

286
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,640
Ruihua.

287
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,160
Who are you?

288
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,080
Do I know you?

289
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,960
I don't know you.

290
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,400
I don't want you to care.

291
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,080
I want to eat a chicken.

292
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,120
Ruihua.

293
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,920
Where is Zhao Dongchun?

294
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,080
Dr. Zhao.

295
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,000
He's in the full-face examination.

296
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He's walking in this direction.

297
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,560
Are you okay?

298
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,720
Sorry.

299
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,600
Brother An Ning.

300
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,960
You're here.

301
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,600
No one bought me an ice cream.

302
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,680
You buy me a good one.

303
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,240
No.

304
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,400
I'm not Brother A'Ping.

305
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,520
You've got the wrong person.

306
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,400
You're lucky to have met him.

307
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,040
I have something else to do.

308
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,760
I'll give you candy.

309
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,320
You buy me an ice cream.

310
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,200
I have a lot of candy.

311
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,920
I don't eat candy.

312
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,560
I can't afford to buy ice cream.

313
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,360
Ruihua.

314
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,160
Let go.

315
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,240
Don't go.

316
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,040
He hit you.

317
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
I didn't mean to hit him.

318
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,360
You're a young man.

319
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,200
Why are you like this?

320
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I'm here to find someone.

321
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,120
You're not allowed to find someone.

322
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,520
Young man.

323
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,560
What's going on?

324
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,280
Doctor.

325
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm here to find you.

326
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,280
Young man.

327
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,920
How can you be so stubborn?

328
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,400
I'm here to find him.

329
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,800
You're with Zhao Dengcheng.

330
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,880
Where's Zhao Dengcheng?

331
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,400
Where's Zhao Dengcheng?

332
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,720
Young man.

333
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,120
Zhao Dengcheng.

334
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,640
Don't go.

335
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,240
Don't go.

336
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,640
You.

337
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,440
Don't go.

338
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,880
What are you doing?

339
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,240
Here you are.

340
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,080
Thank you, Brother A'Ping.

341
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,680
You can't stand people.

342
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,960
Go home.

343
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,080
Go home.

344
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,640
Sorry.

345
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,000
Go home.

346
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,600
Sorry.

347
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,000
Sorry.

348
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,560
Sorry.

349
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,160
Next week,

350
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,880
I'll come to you again to get the needle.

351
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
Yes.

352
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,200
Zhou Yi.

353
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,120
I'll find you again.

354
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,240
Let's go.

355
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,960
Dr. Zhang.

356
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,880
I'll go home.

357
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,760
Sorry.

358
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,640
Sorry.

359
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,480
It's okay.

360
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,480
What's going on?

361
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,120
A letter to send someone.

362
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,240
Where's my stuff?

363
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,960
What stuff?

364
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,280
What do you mean?

365
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,000
Mobile phone, wallet, ID card.

366
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,840
What attitude?

367
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,680
That's my attitude.

368
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,160
What's wrong?

369
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,120
You ran into someone outside.

370
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,920
Who's responsible?

371
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,400
I don't care who's responsible.

372
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,920
Who's the doctor in this hospital?

373
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,600
And you.

374
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,200
Who are you?

375
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,920
Are you scolding me?

376
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,680
I'm your brother.

377
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,920
I don't have a brother.

378
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,920
Brother Jun.

379
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,160
Why are you standing here?

380
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,600
You hear their noise.

381
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,000
So fierce.

382
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,720
I have to keep an eye on them.

383
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,520
In case they come,

384
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,600
I'll call someone.

385
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,760
Did you send her away?

386
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,240
Just now.

387
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,920
But you have to make sure

388
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,640
she sees Brother A'Ping on Monday.

389
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,640
Then our goal is the same.

390
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,360
Leave her.

391
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,480
Leave her?

392
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,320
What do you think, Brother Jun?

393
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,400
Leave her.

394
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,720
We haven't seen each other for 17 years.

395
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,640
I left when I was five.

396
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,960
I don't have a brother like you.

397
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,720
You're so stubborn.

398
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,520
I owe you.

399
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,960
Don't change the topic.

400
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,840
Where's my stuff?

401
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,640
Give it to me.

402
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,480
It's in the bathroom.

403
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,000
Who's the bathroom?

404
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,280
It's not short.

405
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,640
Bathroom.

406
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,800
Bathroom.

407
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,880
It's me.

408
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,880
I have the stuff.

409
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,120
I'll return it to you.

410
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,640
It's not your fault.

411
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,680
It's your brother's fault.

412
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,520
You're too impulsive.

413
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,680
How about this?

414
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,040
We'll treat you to a meal.

415
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,080
No.

416
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,280
You have to eat.

417
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,320
Tell me what you want to eat.

418
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,160
I'll treat you.

419
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,200
I said no.

420
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
I want to find something.

421
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't touch me.

422
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
I told you before.

423
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,680
Your brother

424
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,400
was in a hurry because of you.

425
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,240
Then he...

426
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
He's so stubborn.

427
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,960
You know?

428
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,680
I think you have a problem too.

429
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,880
Where's my stuff?

430
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,480
Give it to me.

431
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,400
Don't be so excited.

432
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,240
You have to eat.

433
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,080
Let's talk about it.

434
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,600
Yes.

435
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,400
I don't want it.

436
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,120
Do you understand?

437
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,280
I'll give it to you after we finish eating.

438
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,120
Don't say that.

439
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,320
Brother.

440
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,200
It's time to get off work.

441
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,960
Let's eat together.

442
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,640
Okay.

443
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,040
Why is he so angry?

444
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,480
What are you eating?

445
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,040
What are you doing?

446
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,320
I'm not hungry.

447
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,920
I'm just taking a breath.

448
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,760
I'm going to the bathroom.

449
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,120
How did he do that?

450
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,560
It's easy.

451
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,480
We've reached the same goal.

452
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,320
We'll leave it to the male nurse.

453
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,520
Male nurse?

454
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,920
You don't know.

455
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,000
Your brother studied

456
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,480
in the nursing profession.

457
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,000
I...

458
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,080
I even saw an internship certificate

459
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,560
in his wallet.

460
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,920
Look.

461
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,440
You can't just leave it to him.

462
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,480
You can't just

463
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,520
lock it in your house.

464
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,640
Let him work in our

465
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,040
chronic disease department.

466
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,400
Professional dialogue.

467
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,240
It's reasonable.

468
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,480
You can monitor it for 24 hours.

469
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,280
Perfect.

470
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,640
And then wait until next Monday.

471
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,240
Then take him back to

472
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,960
the female nurse

473
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,120
in a healthy and safe way.

474
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,440
Perfect.

475
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,440
I'm still worried about

476
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,360
his health.

477
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,200
He's the only one.

478
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,880
Jun, what do you think?

479
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,720
I think he should stay.

480
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,040
You should stay, too.

481
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,420
What will I say to him?

482
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,880
Don't talk back.

483
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,920
I'm not going to walk about without you.

484
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,360
I hope you don't mind my words.

485
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,920
Make a phone call.

486
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,060
What are you talking about?

487
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,520
Let me tell you.

488
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,920
I found a resignation letter

489
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,880
in his jacket pocket.

490
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,800
I know him

491
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,360
Brother Jun

492
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,840
Zhao won't leave

493
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,800
He won't leave once or twice

494
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
And I tell you

495
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,480
Even if we don't stop him

496
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,800
Even without his brother

497
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,920
He won't leave

498
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,920
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

499
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,440
I found this resignation letter

500
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,600
I didn't sleep well all night

501
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,320
You didn't mention it, Brother Jun

502
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,800
Are you sure it won't...

503
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,920
Don't worry

504
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,360
Even if all of us leave

505
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,560
Zhao Dongcheng won't leave

506
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,560
Really?

507
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,360
You...

508
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,560
You can see if there are enough dishes

509
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,400
Hello

510
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,400
Hello

511
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,200
Hello

512
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,120
Hello

513
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,720
Are you Mr. Shi's granddaughter?

514
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,080
Yes, which one?

515
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,400
Hello

516
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,720
The doctor here

517
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,840
I know

518
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,240
Doctor?

519
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,800
What happened to your grandpa?

520
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,800
He came here yesterday

521
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,200
Said his stomach was a little uncomfortable

522
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,520
I gave him some simple tests

523
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,560
The test result is the same as before

524
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,840
But he said he was sick every time he finished his meal

525
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
In this case

526
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,240
Okay, I know

527
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,320
I will handle it, okay?

528
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,160
Will you check the tissue?

529
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,960
Come on, let him...

530
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,920
Stop the machine

531
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,120
Stop the machine

532
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,480
How about this?

533
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,160
You go ahead

534
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,520
I'll contact you later

535
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,840
But if you have time

536
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,080
Take him to the hospital

537
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,120
Do a full check

538
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,640
Okay?

539
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,240
Okay, I got it

540
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,880
Thank you

541
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,640
Sitston

542
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,880
This situation isn't very good

543
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,000
Sitston

544
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,600
Or we should go to the Fourier medicine hospital

545
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,000
Do a full check

546
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,280
No chili?

547
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,360
Give me a piece

548
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,640
Go after him

549
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,080
Give this to me

550
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,680
Is it beautiful?

551
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,960
Yes

552
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,440
So much fun

553
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
I am having fun

554
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:32,920
comfortable

555
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
Rui Hua.

556
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Rui Hua.

557
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,680
Rui Hua, look at me.

558
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,080
I'm the elder brother in the hospital.

559
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Do you remember me?

560
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,880
My hometown.

561
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,800
My beloved hometown.

562
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,600
It's not good.

563
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,080
The movie is not good.

564
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
I can't watch it.

565
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,600
I'm going to find him.

566
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Who?

567
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,320
By the way,

568
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,680
where is your grandpa?

569
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
Where did he go?

570
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,640
Which grandpa?

571
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,840
I don't know which grandpa.

572
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
You know where you're going, right?

573
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Where am I going?

574
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Yes.

575
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
What am I going to find?

576
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
I can't remember.

577
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
How about this?

578
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You go to the hospital with me.

579
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
What am I going to find?

580
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Hospital.

581
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,400
I'm not in the hospital.

582
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
I don't go to the hospital.

583
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Then I'll treat you to dinner.

584
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
I... I want to find something.

585
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
But I can't remember.

586
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I can't let you be here alone.

587
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Look.

588
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
What is that?

589
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Ice cream.

590
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
I'll buy you ice cream.

591
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Okay?

592
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Go.

593
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Buy ice cream.

594
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Don't cry.

595
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Aunt, give me an ice cream.

596
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Thank you.

597
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
By the way,

598
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
you can't put ice cream in your clothes.

599
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
It will melt.

600
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
I won't put it in my clothes.

601
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Take it with you.

602
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Ruihua.

603
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
You're here.

604
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Why are you out alone?

605
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Where have you been?

606
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
You don't have to earn so much money.

607
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Go home.

608
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
I'm not going to go home.

609
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Ruihua.

610
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
You remember to come back?

611
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Who are you?

612
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Ruihua is like a child.

613
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
She will get lost.

614
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
She wants to eat ice cream.

615
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
She even forgets many things.

616
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Even if she looks like that,

617
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
we will call her grandma.

618
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
Where are you?

619
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
Ruihua.

620
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Don't run around.

621
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
I'm an adult.

622
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
You're afraid that I'll get lost?

623
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
I don't know you.

624
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,480
I don't want you to care about me.

625
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
I want to eat ice cream.

626
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Ruihua.

627
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
I don't know you.

628
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
I don't know you.

629
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Don't run around.

630
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,280
I wanted to tell me

631
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
that you doesn't know me.

632
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Who is it?

633
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
Who is it?

634
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
I heard someone told you

635
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,280
that you don't know me.

636
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,880
I wanted to be honest

637
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
and ask be honest about it.

638
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
You never knew me.

639
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,480
Her brother is here.

640
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
They all call me brother.

641
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,480
When we were dating,

642
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
he called me Brother A'Ping.

643
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,480
After we got married,

644
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,480
he called me Old Man. Old Man.

645
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Now, for him,

646
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,480
I'm a stranger.

647
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,480
We've been married for over 50 years.

648
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,480
We have a son.

649
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
Do you know what my name is?

650
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,480
I'm...

651
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
My name is Zhong Qiping.

652
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Brother A'Ping.

653
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
You used to call me that.

654
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Who are you?

655
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
I don't know you.

656
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
What kind of food is this?

657
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
I don't eat.

658
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Ruihua,

659
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
don't lose me too.

660
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Thank you.

661
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
I just came out to buy something.

662
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Who knew that

663
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
he suddenly ran out

664
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
and even opened all my doors.

665
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
I'm old.

666
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
You don't know

667
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
how much time I've spent taking care of him.

668
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Even though he doesn't remember me anymore,

669
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
as long as he's safe and sound,

670
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
I'm satisfied.

671
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,480
He still remembers you.

672
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
On his way here,

673
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,480
he was singing and looking for something.

674
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
When I talked to him,

675
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
he recognized me,

676
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
but when you showed up,

677
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
he suddenly lost his sight.

678
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
He didn't forget you.

679
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,480
He kept looking for you.

680
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Gu Xiang,

681
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
my dear Gu Xiang,

682
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
said that movies are not good.

683
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,480
He really remembers?

684
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,480
He still remembers?

685
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,480
He remembers.

686
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
That's the theme song

687
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
in the movie, Lushan Hall.

688
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,480
When the movie was being released,

689
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
we were already married.

690
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,480
He was watching a movie in the cinema.

691
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,480
I came out to buy some goods.

692
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,480
I had an accident and got my foot hurt.

693
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,480
He came to the hospital.

694
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480
He was crying and crying.

695
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,480
I felt so bad.

696
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,480
He was in the cinema,

697
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
looking at other people's stories.

698
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,480
I laughed so hard.

699
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
He still remembers.

700
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,480
What does it mean

701
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,480
that the ice cream can't be put in the clothes

702
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
and it melts?

703
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,480
At that time,

704
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
we were poor.

705
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,480
I saved a lot of money

706
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
and bought him an ice cream stick.

707
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
I was afraid that it would melt.

708
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
I saw that the shop

709
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
was kept warm with a quilt.

710
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
I put it in the pocket.

711
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
When I went home,

712
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,480
I saw that it melted.

713
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
It was just a little bit.

714
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
I told him,

715
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,480
if I had money in the future,

716
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,480
I would buy it for you.

717
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Grandma didn't forget

718
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
that she was a good girl.

719
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
You are not a stranger.

720
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Although she forgot

721
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
what you look like,

722
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
she never forgot

723
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,480
how much she loved you.

724
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,480
What does it matter

725
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
if I am a stranger?

726
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
What should be left

727
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,480
will always be left.

728
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Who are you?

729
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Who are you?

730
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,480
I am your brother.

731
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
I am your brother.

732
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
We haven't seen each other for 17 years

733
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,480
since my parents divorced.

734
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Brother.

735
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,480
Zhao Xuyang.

736
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,480
You are Zhao Xuyang, not Gen Pichong.

737
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,480
Why are you following me?

738
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
Brother, I need to go to the toilet.

739
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
You just went there.

740
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Why are you going there again?

741
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
I want to go.

742
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
I think you shouldn't be called Zhao Xuyang.

743
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
You should be called Zhao Xuxu.

744
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,480
I will buy you a new pillow.

745
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
You don't need to sleep with my arms.

746
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Do you like to eat purple peach ginger?

747
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Yes.

748
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
Come on.

749
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,480
You have been sitting for so long.

750
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
No.

751
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
I am back.

752
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
You can't eat.

753
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
You are feeling better?

754
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Brother, do you want to eat something else?

755
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,480
I will order more for you.

756
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,480
I am hungry.

757
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Thank you.

758
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
Come on.

759
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Let's eat.

760
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
Come on.

761
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,480
Let's eat.

762
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Yi Shang is back.

763
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Yi Shang.

764
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,480
Yi Shang, you are back.

765
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Yi Shang.

766
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,480
Bye.

767
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
See you tomorrow.

768
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
Bye.

769
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
Don't bother.

770
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,480
Just leave him alone.

771
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
Let's talk downstairs.

772
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
After my parents divorced,

773
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,480
we moved here.

774
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,480
This is my home.

775
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,480
It's a big change.

776
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,480
That is the new building.

777
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
This is the old community.

778
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Dad always told me

779
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,480
this is the purple peach ginger you like.

780
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,480
But I don't know where it is now.

781
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,480
I will ask later.

782
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,480
I don't really like it.

783
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,480
My mom always makes it.

784
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,480
But you all don't eat.

785
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,020
She insisted on telling my family that I love it.

786
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Do you remember?

787
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,560
I don't like purple sweet potato.

788
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,480
But I know that Mom's cooking is the best in the world.

789
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,480
After they divorced, Guan Shan took you away.

790
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Dad never mentioned you to us.

791
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
How's Mom?

792
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,940
You don't know?

793
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Mom's gone?

794
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
What do you mean?

795
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,940
Mom's gone.

796
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,140
Accident.

797
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,980
I remember that after she got into an accident,

798
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,140
she was unconscious for seven days.

799
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,480
She said she missed you and wanted to see you.

800
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
I called Dad.

801
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
I kept calling but no one answered.

802
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
We didn't get a call.

803
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Then Mom left.

804
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,180
Do you know now?

805
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
You're Mom's good son.

806
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
You know nothing.

807
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,820
off

808
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,600
In a box

809
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,640
2 am

810
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,560
What's the point?

811
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,480
You were first.

812
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,060
I told you no.

813
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,980
I yielded unworthily.

814
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,360
Look bends.

815
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,600
What's it with you?

816
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,600
You had so much,

817
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,680
government money.

818
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,480
You even saw catering myself.

819
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,440
It's 11 miles by train.

820
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,760
At most, forty.

821
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,480
How can you give me eighty?

822
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,520
I won't argue with you if you want less.

823
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,560
If you give me more,

824
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,920
I won't give you more.

825
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,600
I've been driving for more than ten years.

826
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,320
I've never met a man like you.

827
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,320
Wu Tian.

828
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,000
Don't go.

829
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,480
I'm telling you.

830
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,080
Don't go.

831
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,720
Don't go.

832
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,520
What are you doing?

833
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,320
What are you doing?

834
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,520
What are you shouting for?

835
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,040
I can hear you shouting all the way.

836
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,720
He doesn't give enough money.

837
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,320
Master, please talk nicely.

838
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,480
I didn't give you a penny less.

839
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,680
If you really want to make him happy,

840
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,960
let's go to the police station, okay?

841
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,560
Did you hear that?

842
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,640
I didn't give you money less.

843
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Are you going to the police station?

844
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,080
How many kilometers are there on the island now?

845
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,640
There are thousands of them.

846
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,720
You're going around first.

847
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,800
I'll go with you.

848
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,880
I'll go with you, okay?

849
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,680
Thank you.

850
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,960
It's okay.

851
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,320
Near the residence.

852
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,320
You too.

853
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,640
I lived here when I was a kid.

854
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
You came back to see the rich.

855
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,200
It's nothing.

856
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,680
It's rare to come back.

857
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,720
Don't ruin your mood because of this kind of person.

858
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,320
That's not true.

859
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,320
I suddenly feel a little unfamiliar when I come back.

860
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,000
But it's been a long time.

861
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,120
I think I'll feel familiar after a while.

862
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,120
I haven't seen you for more than ten years.

863
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,000
I don't even know you.

864
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,480
Will you?

865
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,560
Thank you.

866
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,440
I'll go back first.

867
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,160
Will you really get back together?

868
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,680
I ordered a few dishes.

869
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,240
The meal looks like a family meal.

870
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,120
There are pictures on it.

871
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
Did Dou Ge order it?

872
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,400
Didn't Dou Ge just eat it last night?

873
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,400
Where's the stewed pork ribs?

874
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,320
Just order whatever you want.

875
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,640
Just order this family number.

876
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,160
Do you know?

877
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,120
Zhao Zongcheng's brother is back.

878
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,160
The one he took away when his mother got divorced.

879
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:03,960
Yes.

880
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,240
What about his mother?

881
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,160
Did his mother come back?

882
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,120
No.

883
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,240
He came back by himself.

884
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,520
What's Zhao Zongcheng's reaction?

885
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,040
He hasn't seen him for so many years.

886
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,600
What can he be?

887
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,480
He's the same.

888
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,040
Stinky temper and a bad mouth.

889
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,440
What do you think about his brother now?

890
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
I've counted.

891
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,360
He's in his twenties.

892
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,520
He's married.

893
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,920
Where was he before?

894
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,040
How would I know?

895
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,080
Do you think his brother came back

896
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,720
to steal the house?

897
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,360
Mom, what are you thinking about?

898
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,320
I'm telling you, you don't understand.

899
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,000
I've seen a lot of them.

900
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,320
I'm telling you,

901
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,680
you have to remind Zhao Zongcheng.

902
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,600
Is it done?

903
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,200
Yes.

904
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,600
Waiter, order.

905
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,320
How are you recently?

906
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,160
I'm fine.

907
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,680
I mean, I'm fine.

908
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,400
You saw it.

909
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,200
Look at you.

910
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,360
We've been on the phone for three days.

911
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,960
It's so annoying to ask him

912
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,200
if he's back.

913
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,800
By the way,

914
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,960
Gui is getting more and more disobedient.

915
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,040
He's so clumsy.

916
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,560
You have to educate him.

917
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,600
Gui, come here.

918
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,920
Gui will educate him later.

919
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,120
I think you need to educate him too.

920
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,800
Sit down.

921
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,160
Did you three lie?

922
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,740
Gui aboutä¸

923
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,960
You hurt Gui recently?

924
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,000
Gui.

925
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,360
What Gui Bui is good.

926
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,840
This morning

927
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,680
I ate a bowl of rice noodle soup

928
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,720
with 4 patient.

929
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,040
Alright.

930
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,520
I can guess when you three lied.

931
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,240
You can guess it?

932
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,000
Tell me, how do you know?

933
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,400
Then can I tell you?

934
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,920
I just want to tell you

935
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,240
why we neveride in the short circuit last time.

936
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
You just can't guess.

937
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,200
I've arranged the hospital.

938
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Let's go there this time.

939
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,200
Let's check his body thoroughly.

940
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
You're so clear.

941
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
It's well arranged.

942
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Of course.

943
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Why do you need to tell me?

944
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,200
Actually, I don't have any stomachache.

945
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
I just need to take some stomach-suffering pills.

946
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
No.

947
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
You have to listen to me this time.

948
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Listen to me.

949
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
You need to pack your things now.

950
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
We'll go there tonight.

951
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
We have to go.

952
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
No.

953
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
No.

954
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
I...

955
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
What if I go to your A Gui?

956
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
A Gui, I'll find someone to give you a rest.

957
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Who are you looking for?

958
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
I want to ask Dr. Zhao, okay?

959
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
How do you know Dr. Zhao?

960
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
You're so shy to say it.

961
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
You tell Dr. Zhao everything.

962
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
You don't tell me anything.

963
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Oh.

964
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Zhao Dongcheng, the traitor.

965
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Okay.

966
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
You...

967
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Don't say anything.

968
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
Pack your things now.

969
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
It's okay.

970
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
It's okay.

971
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Let's go to check.

972
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
No need to go to the hospital.

973
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
It's so troublesome to go to the hospital.

974
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
It's okay.

975
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
He came to me last week.

976
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
He said he was dizzy.

977
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
He was dizzy as soon as he stood up.

978
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
I asked him how long he had been sitting.

979
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
He said five hours.

980
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
I said you sat for five hours.

981
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Why didn't you get dizzy when you stood up?

982
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Last week, he came to me again.

983
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
He said he kept coughing.

984
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,200
I said you haven't coughed since you entered the door.

985
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
I said that.

986
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,200
He started to cough again.

987
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
He didn't tell you.

988
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
It doesn't mean he doesn't need to care.

989
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
Let's go.

990
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Wait a minute.

991
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
He contacted me before.

992
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
What happened between you and Guanran?

993
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
I'm sorry.

994
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
I'm sorry.

995
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,200
I'm sorry.

996
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
I'm sorry.

997
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
I'm sorry.

998
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
I'm sorry.

999
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
I'm sorry.

1000
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,200
I'm sorry.

1001
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
I'm sorry.

1002
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,200
I'm sorry.

1003
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,200
I'm sorry.

1004
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
I'm sorry.

1005
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
I'm sorry.

1006
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
I'm sorry.

1007
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
I'm sorry.

1008
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,200
I'm sorry.

1009
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,200
I'm sorry.

1010
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
I'm sorry.

1011
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
I'm sorry.

1012
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
I'm sorry.

1013
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
I'm sorry.

1014
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
I'm sorry.

1015
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
I'm sorry.

1016
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
I'm sorry.

1017
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
I'm sorry.

1018
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
I'm sorry.

1019
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
I'm sorry.

1020
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
I'm sorry.

1021
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
I'm sorry.

1022
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
I'm sorry.

1023
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
I'm sorry.

1024
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
I'm sorry.

1025
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
I'm sorry.

1026
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Please bring back your phone.

1027
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
I'm sorry.

1028
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
I'm sorry.

1029
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Please don't call.

1030
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
I'm sorry.

1031
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
I'm sorry.

1032
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
I'm sorry.

1033
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
I'm sorry.

1034
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
I'm sorry.

1035
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
I'm sorry.

1036
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
I'm sorry.

1037
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
I'm sorry.

1038
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
It's fine if you don't say anything.

1039
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
But I have to be responsible for you.

1040
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,040
It's

1041
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,800
You believed every word

1042
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,000
You have to be responsible

1043
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,480
You don't have much money now

1044
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,680
You don't know where to find it

1045
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,980
You can't do retail

1046
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,780
You give yourself a little time

1047
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,500
Give me some time

1048
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,540
Stay here for three months

1049
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,480
Go to the community hospital

1050
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,720
I'll give you her contact information three months later.

1051
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,200
I knew you didn't play a good role.

1052
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,120
Let's talk about it.

1053
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,960
I'm sorry about mom.

1054
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,200
I'm sorry.

1055
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,400
Director of Photography

1056
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,960
You tricked me into doing this,

1057
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,680
and you chose to Campus Bond.

1058
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,240
What do you really want?

1059
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,840
What's the deal now?

1060
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,240
We can see that

1061
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,040
huge Green Ð¾Ð±

1062
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,400
Manager situation

1063
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,680
This.

1064
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,000
Still if one

1065
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,520
take half the pepper

1066
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,360
can give it a taste.

1067
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,680
This is something you are good at

1068
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,400
Correct

1069
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,640
Your daughter is back

1070
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,080
Doctor

1071
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,680
This is our fifth floor

1072
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,160
New aunt

1073
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,040
Hello aunt

1074
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,520
The little girl looks like mom

1075
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,720
How old

1076
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,520
What little girl old girl

1077
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,680
It's all 40

1078
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,160
By the way, doctor

1079
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,640
When you go to the hospital tomorrow

1080
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,760
Don't forget to put the refrigerator

1081
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,840
That chili radish

1082
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,960
Go to your sister

1083
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,880
Got it

1084
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,680
I'm going back

1085
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,880
Your daughter is a doctor

1086
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,000
Yes

1087
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,840
Which hospital

1088
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,880
What department

1089
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,120
General department

1090
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,280
Where is it

1091
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,600
It doesn't matter if you say it

1092
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,120
By the way, you didn't know to learn that

1093
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,240
I haven't finished it yet

1094
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,080
I forgot

1095
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,800
I'm so bold

1096
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,000
I like to eat this thing I made

1097
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,720
Go go

1098
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,600
This is not a beam

1099
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:56,520
You read it

1100
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,480
Have you eaten

1101
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,320
I brought you meat Mario

1102
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,360
And watermelon

1103
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:07,960
This is not spicy

1104
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,160
It's delicious but try it

1105
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,400
We were colleagues in the unit.

1106
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,640
We became house owners and tenants when we got home.

1107
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,000
Fine.

1108
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,520
I won't stop you.

1109
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,760
Wait.

1110
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,520
Where are you going?

1111
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:25,960
A'gui.

1112
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:26,680
A'gui.

1113
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,480
Hold him.

1114
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,720
This is our new house.

1115
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,160
A'gui.

1116
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,840
Hold him.

1117
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,600
A'gui, don't.

1118
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,800
Are you crazy?

1119
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,320
A'gui.

1120
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:34,880
Come here.

1121
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:35,840
Come here.

1122
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,000
Don't touch him.

1123
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,600
Hold him.

1124
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:39,720
Come here.

1125
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,000
Hold him.

1126
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,080
Are you crazy?

1127
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,000
Are you afraid of dogs?

1128
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,280
Don't touch him.

1129
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,760
Don't touch him.

1130
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,440
Almost.

1131
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,600
I must keep you this time.

1132
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,480
So scary.

1133
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,960
What are you waiting for?

1134
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,000
You're going to be late.

1135
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,760
Sister.

1136
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,600
Are you ready for the first day of work?

1137
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,600
I've sent Yi Yi to kindergarten.

1138
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,600
I think it's too early.

1139
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,400
I just want to say that we can go together.

1140
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,520
So many brothers and sisters are happy to be with you at work.

1141
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,040
Okay, let's go.

1142
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,080
Go.

1143
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:58,680
Make

1144
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,680
No one is more important than them in the world of entertainment.

1145
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,280
Xiao Guan.

1146
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:10,960
You're here for work.

1147
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,440
That's great.

1148
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,600
We're a family now.

1149
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,400
A family.

1150
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,120
Do the hand-over ceremony with me in the office first.

1151
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,360
Then go to the private class.

1152
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,520
Go.

1153
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:22,960
Someone is watching.

1154
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,520
Okay.

1155
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,640
I'll go with you, sister.

1156
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,720
I'll go with her.

1157
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,520
You're worried about me, Brother Jun?

1158
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,240
I'm worried about you.

1159
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,240
Let's go.

1160
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,400
You're too enthusiastic.

1161
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,160
I didn't see you come out to welcome me when I was working.

1162
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,600
What are you talking about?

1163
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,280
Xiao Guan, you look energetic.

1164
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,120
Am I energetic?

1165
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:45,960
More energetic than you.

1166
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,320
I won't talk to you then. I'm going to work.

1167
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,800
What if we five go to a business meeting?

1168
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,240
We'll be together for a long time.

1169
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,120
What are you talking about?

1170
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,720
Wu Zitan Ke?

1171
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,840
The beauties of Manbin Ke

1172
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,120
introduce a new person to you today.

1173
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,760
This is Guan Xu.

1174
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,880
You can call her Xiao Guan.

1175
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,680
You're still here.

1176
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,040
Don't you have to go to work?

1177
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,160
I have to.

1178
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,680
I still have time.

1179
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,600
Sister, let me introduce you.

1180
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,600
This is Zhu Xiping.

1181
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,920
Sister Zhu is the most reliable and gentle sister of Manbin Ke.

1182
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,120
She's a first-class star painter.

1183
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,080
She can understand everything.

1184
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,880
Master Yu is usually busy.

1185
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,080
You can always find her.

1186
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,760
All right, all right, Liu Jin.

1187
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,080
Don't make me do anything.

1188
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,320
I can hear you.

1189
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,760
Welcome, Xiao Guan.

1190
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,680
Sister Zhu.

1191
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,520
This is Gao Yang.

1192
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,400
She's the little old lady in our hospital.

1193
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,400
You can find her if you want to know anything.

1194
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,560
Hello.

1195
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,080
This is Yun, the gentle lady in our hospital.

1196
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,120
Her parents and her grandparents

1197
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,720
can't even call her when they see her.

1198
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,560
She's also the fastest-growing new person.

1199
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,120
You have to work hard together.

1200
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,000
Let's work hard together.

1201
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,560
You're late, but you're still here acting as a senior.

1202
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,240
There's another one.

1203
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,080
She's the little girl in the pre-trial station today.

1204
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,240
This person is a little skillful.

1205
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,960
The last one doesn't have to be introduced.

1206
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,960
She's the most fierce woman in Manbin Ke.

1207
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,120
Our community hospital

1208
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,200
is different from the big hospital you've been to.

1209
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,960
Do you know what Manbin Ke does?

1210
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,000
Man... Manbin Ke is...

1211
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,800
It's in charge of diabetes, high blood pressure, high blood pressure,

1212
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,680
and government's 14 public health services.

1213
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,800
We have a rule here.

1214
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,000
You don't have to teach. You can just start working.

1215
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:33,920
That's right.

1216
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,200
Xiao Guan is here.

1217
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,320
Help me carry these bags of rice

1218
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,640
to our doorstep.

1219
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,520
This?

1220
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,080
This is a food for the disabled in the upper-level organization.

1221
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,480
So we have another job in our department

1222
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,360
which is to take care of various daily things.

1223
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,400
Let me do it. Let me help.

1224
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,520
I'll leave, Uncle Yun.

1225
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,560
Hurry up.

1226
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,320
Thank you, Uncle Yun.

1227
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,120
Thank you, Uncle Guan.

1228
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,000
From the first stop,

1229
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,560
to the second stop,

1230
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,080
from the first stop,

1231
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,120
to the second stop,

1232
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,680
to the third stop.

1233
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,640
How can I get through this traffic jam?

1234
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,120
Who has such a good heart?

1235
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,000
That's right.

1236
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,080
It's so dirty.

1237
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,880
It's so dirty.

1238
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,920
You're so bold.

1239
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,560
It's been so long.

1240
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,160
It's been so long.

1241
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,840
You're new to our department, right?

1242
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,800
Do me a favor.

1243
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,760
Their car is blocked.

1244
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,800
Can you help me take a look?

1245
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,400
Thank you. Help me.

1246
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,600
Don't bother.

1247
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,360
Go.

1248
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,240
I'm so drunk.

1249
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,400
I'm so drunk.

1250
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,120
Go.

1251
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,960
I'm so drunk.

1252
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,080
Hurry up.

1253
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:24,920
I'm so drunk.

1254
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,800
I'm so drunk.

1255
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,240
Hurry up.

1256
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm in a hurry.

1257
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:27,720
Hurry up.

1258
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,560
Hurry up.

1259
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,280
Hurry up.

1260
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,200
I know.

1261
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,160
I'll go take a look.

1262
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:31,680
Hurry up.

1263
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,960
I'll go ask the owner.

1264
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:33,920
I'll find something.

1265
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,480
Hello.

1266
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,160
I want to ask

1267
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,120
if LC 856 is your car?

1268
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,840
No.

1269
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,280
LC 856 is your car?

1270
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:39,800
No.

1271
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,400
Uncle.

1272
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,800
Is LC 856 your car?

1273
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,440
No.

1274
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,800
Don't move.

1275
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:45,760
Hurry up.

1276
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,480
I'm so drunk.

1277
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,360
I'm so drunk.

1278
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,280
I'm so drunk.

1279
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:49,920
Don't move.

1280
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,840
Stop.

1281
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,920
Just press the button.

1282
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,800
Press the button.

1283
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,800
Don't move.

1284
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,760
It hurts more and more.

1285
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,360
Be good.

1286
00:49:59,440 --> 00:49:59,880
Don't move.

1287
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,520
Hold on.

1288
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,520
Hold on.

1289
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,440
Is LC 856 your car?

1290
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,120
No.

1291
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:04,680
Hello.

1292
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,480
LC 856...

1293
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,080
No.

1294
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,360
Is LC 856 your car?

1295
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,000
No.

1296
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:08,560
I want to ask

1297
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,880
if LC 856 is your car?

1298
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,520
No.

1299
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,120
I want to ask

1300
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,600
if LC 856 is your car?

1301
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,360
No.

1302
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,960
But I know whose car it is.

1303
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,520
I'm late.

1304
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,000
I'm late.

1305
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,600
Wait.

1306
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,640
Sorry.

1307
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,720
Sorry.

1308
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,280
It's this woman.

1309
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,000
LC 856 is your car.

1310
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,080
Move it for me.

1311
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,520
I know I'm late.

1312
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,040
I'll move it later.

1313
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:26,840
I have something to do.

1314
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,200
No.

1315
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,320
You'd better move it now.

1316
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,080
Move it.

1317
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,640
I said I'd move it later.

1318
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,200
Move it now.

1319
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,080
It's not good to block other people's cars.

1320
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:35,640
You...

1321
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,120
Follow me to do a health survey.

1322
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,280
Let me show you the process.

1323
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:41,840
Let's go.

1324
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:42,960
Okay.

1325
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,560
In addition to managing

1326
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,840
the health files of residents,

1327
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,520
it also includes

1328
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,400
the maintenance of the people in critical condition,

1329
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,240
the daily medical records of hospitals,

1330
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,600
and some health

1331
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,320
and health research.

1332
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,480
Adults' tobacco and weed research,

1333
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,800
and the research on Chinese medicine culture,

1334
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,160
etc.

1335
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:56,640
These are all

1336
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,760
the work of our private department.

1337
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:02,960
Here.

1338
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,120
Take Xia Yu's car.

1339
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,160
That's it.

1340
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:09,600
Director,

1341
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:10,960
how about I

1342
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,800
walk over there?

1343
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,800
Give me a location.

1344
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,360
It takes more than ten minutes to ride a car.

1345
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,360
Why do you walk?

1346
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:16,800
I...

1347
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I walk fast.

1348
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,640
You clean it first.

1349
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,160
Then I...

1350
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,240
You don't even know how to ride a bike, do you?

1351
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,520
You really don't know how to ride?

1352
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,000
I...

1353
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,040
I can walk over there.

1354
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,920
I walk fast.

1355
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,440
Don't worry.

1356
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,560
I can't.

1357
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,520
Do you think we have so much time?

1358
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,680
Go and borrow a helmet.

1359
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:36,920
Go.

1360
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,640
Uncle,

1361
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,360
we've just talked to you on the phone.

1362
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,120
We're cooperating with the relevant departments

1363
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,640
to do a full-scale

1364
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,320
health and health check-up.

1365
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,360
Take a look.

1366
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,240
The questions for the investigation are simple.

1367
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,240
What are these questions?

1368
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,080
So many.

1369
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:05,680
Okay.

1370
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,320
It's okay.

1371
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,400
You can choose slowly.

1372
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,760
We won't be in a hurry.

1373
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,960
By the way, uncle,

1374
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,080
please show me your ID card.

1375
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,280
Your ID card.

1376
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,560
I'll show you the ID card.

1377
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,160
Okay.

1378
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:16,840
Okay.

1379
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,240
Your ID card.

1380
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,240
We need to register

1381
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,400
your personal information.

1382
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,440
Okay.

1383
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,600
Thank you.

1384
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,240
How many people are working at home?

1385
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,560
Do you have to choose this?

1386
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,200
Yes.

1387
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,280
These are all basic residents' information.

1388
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,880
So we need to fill them in.

1389
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,000
Dad,

1390
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,160
is the air conditioner on?

1391
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,320
It's too hot outside today.

1392
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,080
Who's that?

1393
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:48,840
Come in.

1394
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,480
I'm here to observe your social distance.

1395
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,480
Okay.

1396
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,120
Go.

1397
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,440
Morning, sir.

1398
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,080
Who are they?

1399
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,080
We are Yuyu.

1400
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,040
Hi,

1401
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,240
I'm Dr. Yu

1402
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,920
from Qingshan Green floods shaped health package.

1403
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:14,880
We're here

1404
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,720
I'm here to check the identity information.

1405
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,880
Dad, I've told you so many times.

1406
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,000
Don't show your ID to others.

1407
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,560
Do you know who they are?

1408
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,800
What if they are liars?

1409
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:26,920
No.

1410
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,080
We're not liars.

1411
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,840
We're doctors in community hospitals.

1412
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,040
Community hospitals?

1413
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,480
What are you doing here?

1414
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,080
Sir, look.

1415
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,960
This is the survey.

1416
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,120
We're here to do a survey

1417
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,720
on the health of the people.

1418
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,880
We can take a look.

1419
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,840
Identity information,

1420
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,480
family situation,

1421
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,760
and what I do

1422
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,160
has nothing to do with you.

1423
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,040
You're violating privacy, you know?

1424
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,160
Sir, it's like this.

1425
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,560
These are just some basic family life

1426
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,720
and some health habits.

1427
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,800
This doesn't involve privacy.

1428
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,720
Survey?

1429
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,240
Then we don't participate in the survey.

1430
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,320
Let's find someone else.

1431
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:03,560
Wait.

1432
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,120
There are a few questions left.

1433
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,040
Am I not explaining it clearly enough?

1434
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,080
No more questions?

1435
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,120
No.

1436
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,560
Please leave.

1437
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,280
There are a few more questions left.

1438
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,000
Yes.

1439
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,520
Please cooperate with our work.

1440
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,080
We're all in line with the rules.

1441
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,600
What are you doing?

1442
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,000
We're doctors in the community hospital.

1443
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,720
Did you hear that?

1444
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,760
I've only heard of internal and external medicine.

1445
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,760
And heart and blood vessels.

1446
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,480
I've never heard of a chronic disease.

1447
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,320
And if you're really doctors,

1448
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,640
please go back to the hospital

1449
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,160
and think about how to treat and save people.

1450
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,600
Don't just go to other people's homes

1451
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,040
and ask these messy questions.

1452
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,200
Do you understand?

1453
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,440
Sorry to bother you.

1454
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,640
We're really doctors.

1455
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,960
I told you to go out.

1456
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,440
Please go out.

1457
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,480
We're not sleeping.

1458
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,480
Hurry up.

1459
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,800
Make it clear.

1460
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:59,680
Say it clearly.

1461
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,280
You said you weren't a liar.

1462
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,400
Enough.

1463
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,240
Stop knocking.

1464
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,240
It's over, right?

1465
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,000
Are you disturbing the people?

1466
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,800
It's so noisy here,

1467
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,600
how about super microfiber providing.

1468
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,160
Okay

1469
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,320
Going to the library too?

1470
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,680
Let's go.

1471
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,120
I called her but he refused me.

1472
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,520
We just got kicked out.

1473
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,480
Why you didn't get mad?

1474
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,420
I think you had a good relationship

1475
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,420
with the residents nearby.

1476
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,180
It's useless.

1477
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,220
But with meis...

1478
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,080
Be steady.

1479
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,280
There are two parts of the community.

1480
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,680
One is the old residential building.

1481
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,280
The other is the new commercial building.

1482
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,000
Not everyone knows us.

1483
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,400
Some residents recognize us

1484
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,080
because they have been with us for a long time.

1485
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,920
But for more people,

1486
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,400
we are just a health care station in the community.

1487
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,920
It's good to be used to it.

1488
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,640
The old residential building.

1489
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,840
The name of the medicine hasn't changed.

1490
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,000
The pharmaceutical factory hasn't changed either.

1491
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,760
The old pharmaceutical factory is not producing it.

1492
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,480
I can't give you the medicine.

1493
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,120
I won't give you the medicine.

1494
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,400
I used to give you the medicine in other hospitals.

1495
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,520
And I don't know the origin of your medicine.

1496
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,160
You can't eat it, right?

1497
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,160
The normal acupoints will cause dizziness.

1498
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,440
I'll give you some nightgowns and B12.

1499
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,440
Come and have a look next week.

1500
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,680
It shouldn't be a big problem.

1501
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,080
That's all?

1502
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,160
Let's go.

1503
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,720
I told you not to come here.

1504
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,280
The hospital is so long.

1505
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,400
What can you do here?

1506
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,400
Let's go.

1507
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:20,760
Go.

1508
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,040
Next one. What do you want?

1509
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,320
Go back and work after the transfer.

1510
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,960
What about the work today?

1511
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:31,960
You don't care?

1512
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,680
I'll call again.

1513
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,120
If it doesn't work, I'll forget it.

1514
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,840
I hope there are not many business cards to be used this time.

1515
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,040
Otherwise, I have to re-select and re-check.

1516
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,160
I hope that when re-selecting,

1517
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,720
I can get a familiar one.

1518
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,640
What's the use of being familiar?

1519
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,840
Aunt Zheng.

1520
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,520
Aunt Zheng.

1521
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,600
Why are you hiding?

1522
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,360
Liu Jin, aren't you busy with work?

1523
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,280
Why are you here?

1524
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,320
I'm here...

1525
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,040
Are you here to open the medicine?

1526
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,120
You're here.

1527
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,080
Why don't you go up?

1528
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,760
You haven't done the treatment for a long time.

1529
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,400
I saw you holding the bag for a long time.

1530
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,680
Is it good for your health?

1531
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,800
Yes.

1532
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,160
I have to go back and cook.

1533
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,280
See you next time.

1534
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,080
Aunt, you haven't done the treatment for a long time.

1535
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,600
Don't just go and stop coming.

1536
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,280
See you next time.

1537
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,280
Dr. Shen.

1538
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,000
I think she will never go to your place again.

1539
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,000
No.

1540
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,840
I couldn't even hold the bag before.

1541
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,680
Look at you now.

1542
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,560
You can even lift the iron a few times.

1543
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,560
She won't say hello to you just like that?

1544
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,080
Look at this.

1545
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,240
This is the message from the person she brought.

1546
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,000
She's here to steal your business.

1547
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,080
What kind of doctor are we?

1548
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,360
This is what a doctor is like.

1549
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,360
Get back to work.

1550
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,440
How is it?

1551
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,720
Did Uncle Yu scold you today?

1552
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,880
Qi Yi Ran, are you off work?

1553
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yes.

1554
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:25,920
Bye. See you tomorrow.

1555
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,320
Okay. See you tomorrow.

1556
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,400
I heard that you were in the sun today.

1557
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,680
So you ran a long circle.

1558
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,400
I'll bring you to eat later.

1559
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,320
Not all the new dishes are spicy.

1560
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,520
Green and red pork.

1561
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,200
No.

1562
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:37,760
Pork with vermicelli.

1563
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,360
No.

1564
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,480
Fried pork with oil tofu.

1565
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,280
If you don't want to go, then I won't go.

1566
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,640
Are you going or not?

1567
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,600
I'm not going either.

1568
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,640
Why are you not going?

1569
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,760
I want to lose weight.

1570
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,080
You should lose weight.

1571
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,400
I'm leaving.

1572
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:52,840
Hurry up.

1573
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,360
I'm leaving.

1574
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:53,840
I'm going to eat.

1575
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,680
Wait for me.

1576
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,720
I'll wait for you.

1577
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,560
Bye.

1578
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,080
Are you going or not?

1579
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,520
Bye.

1580
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,720
If you know how to engage a good relationship,

1581
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,220
please call me.

1582
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,040
Okay.

1583
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,560
Then I'll go first.

1584
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,880
Come back home early.

1585
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,000
I will wait for you

1586
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,040
Mom, how many times have I said

1587
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,000
Knock the door in the house

1588
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,320
What door do I knock in my house

1589
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,920
By the way, I ask you

1590
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,240
You want to send things

1591
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,200
Just put everything together

1592
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,920
You still send up and down two floors

1593
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,920
I thought the bottom floor was for home

1594
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,520
You said you let you do something

1595
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,640
Just a little bit

1596
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,920
Silly

1597
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,920
OK, OK

1598
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,040
I won't beg you anymore

1599
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,040
I send it myself

1600
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,520
Yes, it's so tired

1601
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,920
OK, don't look for me next time

1602
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,320
Don't you go to cook

1603
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,920
You don't have to worry about cooking

1604
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,840
By the way, let me ask you

1605
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,840
Do you still have contact with your former colleagues?

1606
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,840
Why ask this suddenly

1607
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,840
I'm not in the light now

1608
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,840
What's the radish?

1609
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,840
Your former three-storied hospital

1610
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,840
That nurse

1611
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,840
I want to send him some

1612
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,840
No need

1613
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,840
You said you this child

1614
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,840
How is it like this

1615
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,840
How good was he to you before

1616
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,840
Now don't work together

1617
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,840
Then you should contact often

1618
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,840
Work is the human vein

1619
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,840
Maybe there will be a good opportunity in the future

1620
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,840
He suddenly wanted to listen to you

1621
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,840
I heard you

1622
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,840
I asked you to go back

1623
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,840
What's the use of saying this

1624
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,840
What's the use

1625
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,840
Am i wrong

1626
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,840
You said you graduated from college

1627
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,840
I entered such a good hospital

1628
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,840
While working and studying

1629
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,840
Which nurse has your literary reputation

1630
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,840
You say you are now

1631
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,840
In this community hospital

1632
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,840
You look at your sister

1633
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,840
You say you are now your sister

1634
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,840
All right, mom

1635
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,840
I think i'm fine now

1636
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,840
Good, you say

1637
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,840
Mom, okay, mom

1638
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,840
I'm hungry

1639
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,840
I tell you today

1640
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,840
I made it clear to you

1641
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,840
I quit my job right away

1642
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,840
Or you go back

1643
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,840
Your previous hospital is good

1644
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,840
It's good to go to another hospital

1645
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,840
Just don't stay in this community hospital

1646
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,840
I won't quit

1647
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,840
I am very satisfied with my current job

1648
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,840
What are you satisfied with

1649
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,840
Don't say how much money

1650
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,840
Just these people

1651
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,840
To your attitude

1652
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,840
I tell you

1653
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,840
Hurry up and resign

1654
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,840
You said you put it

1655
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,840
Good big hospital

1656
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,840
What kind of public service

1657
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,840
What is this manbing

1658
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,840
I'm explaining to people

1659
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,840
I'm tired

1660
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,840
Doctor is not a doctor

1661
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,840
Nurse is not a nurse

1662
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,840
You say you are

1663
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,840
Mother-in-law

1664
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,840
Who in this world

1665
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,840
Who recognizes you

1666
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,840
What's wrong with the community hospital

1667
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:02,840
Li Jiajing

1668
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,840
The rules of the game are good for the body

1669
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,840
How many people want to do

1670
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,840
Can't do

1671
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:06,840
Nonsense nonsense

1672
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,840
Now in this year

1673
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,840
It's useful to say that the literary pen is useful

1674
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,840
Why is it useless

1675
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:10,840
You say you are now

1676
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,840
Boyfriend boyfriend

1677
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,840
No marriage marriage

1678
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,840
You say you dress like this

1679
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,840
Where is it like a girl

1680
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,840
You must pull my face

1681
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,840
You say you make a mess

1682
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,840
What are you making a mess

1683
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,840
I don't eat

1684
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,840
Don't eat

1685
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,840
Don't eat

1686
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,840
I'm too lazy to do it

1687
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,840
I think the day is a bit long

1688
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,840
Hey, a little panic

1689
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,840
I'm always afraid that the night will become weak

1690
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,840
Change to a white dress

1691
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:07,840
Listen to the heartbeat

1692
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,840
Put love in the blood

1693
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,840
Heal the fragile heart

1694
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:20,840
Open a dream kitchen

1695
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,840
Walk a unforgettable journey

1696
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:43,900
Look at the

1697
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,840
Light up the light of life

1698
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,840
Change to a white dress

1699
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:03,840
Listen to the heartbeat

1700
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,840
Put love in the blood

1701
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,840
Heal the fragile heart

1702
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:16,840
