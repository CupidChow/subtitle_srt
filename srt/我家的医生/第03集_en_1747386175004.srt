I already gave you a Fleischbrot drink.

5
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,940
Of course I have to work harder.

6
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,940
I want to go too.

7
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,940
No, you all went.

8
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,940
What about me?

9
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,940
What about me?

10
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
I also want to take the medical school exam.

11
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,940
You can follow the trend.

12
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,940
Then I'll test you first.

13
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,940
Do you know which class is the college entrance exam?

14
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,940
I...

15
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,940
Do you know how many points each?

16
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,940
Do you know the score line of the medical school?

17
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,940
Don't you want to get rid of me?

18
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,940
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,940
June 29, 2006.

20
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,940
Please.

21
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,940
I swear.

22
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,940
The six-point exam to enter the medical school is definitely an accident.

23
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,940
Mom, I'm a A.

24
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,940
What A?

25
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,940
You can get into the exam.

26
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,940
Then I'm an A.

27
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,940
My son's six-point exam.

28
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
This is me.

29
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,940
You'll see my son in the future.

30
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,940
I'm so happy.

31
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,940
Today is a happy day.

32
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,940
Come on.

33
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,940
Take a picture.

34
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,940
Come on.

35
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,940
I'll take a picture for you.

36
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,940
I promise.

37
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,940
Fish-sweat.

38
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,940
A little higher.

39
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,940
A little higher.

40
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
A little closer.

41
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
A little more happy face.

42
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,940
A little more happy face.

43
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,940
Three, two, one.

44
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,940
Resign.

45
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,940
Resign immediately.

46
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,940
Or you can go back to your old hospital.

47
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,940
It's good to go to another hospital.

48
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,940
Just don't stay in this community hospital.

49
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,940
I won't resign.

50
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,940
I'm very satisfied with my current job.

51
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,940
What are you satisfied with?

52
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,940
I'm satisfied with you.

53
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,940
Don't talk about money.

54
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,940
Just these people.

55
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,940
They have this attitude towards you.

56
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,940
I tell you.

57
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,940
Go to resign quickly.

58
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,940
You said you were in a good big hospital.

59
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,940
Why did you become a public servant?

60
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,940
What is this?

61
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,940
I'm tired of explaining to people.

62
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,940
Doctors are not doctors.

63
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,940
Nurses are not nurses.

64
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,940
You are just nannies.

65
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,940
Who in this society recognizes you?

66
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,940
What's wrong with going to the hospital?

67
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,940
Li Jiajing's routine is good for the body.

68
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,940
How many people can't do what they want to do?

69
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,940
You are a good person.

70
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,940
Is it useful to say that I'm a good person?

71
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,940
Why not?

72
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,940
You said you don't have a boyfriend.

73
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,940
You are married and you don't marry.

74
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,940
You said you dressed like a girl.

75
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,940
You are so shameless.

76
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,940
You said you were making noise.

77
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,940
What noise?

78
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,940
I don't eat spicy food.

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,940
You don't eat spicy food?

80
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,940
You don't eat spicy food?

81
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,940
I'm too lazy to cook.

82
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,940
Didn't you say you don't eat?

83
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,940
I eat whatever I want.

84
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,940
I don't eat whatever I don't want.

85
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,940
You eat fire.

86
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,940
Just order this little bit.

87
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,940
Is that enough?

88
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,940
If there are new dishes, you can order.

89
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,940
What new dishes?

90
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,940
Let me tell you.

91
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,940
That Aunt Zheng came to see me for half a year.

92
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,940
She ran away when she saw me.

93
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,940
What Chinese medicine health center?

94
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,940
It's ridiculous.

95
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,940
I gave Aunt Zheng that treatment.

96
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,940
Only a few stitches left.

97
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,940
She's all good.

98
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,940
At first she said she only recognized me.

99
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,940
Now she doesn't believe me.

100
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,940
Isn't that normal?

101
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
Yes.

102
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,940
Didn't you say that

103
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,940
people should build trust in this relationship.

104
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,940
Right?

105
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,940
Time can change everything.

106
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,940
Did she say that?

107
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,940
Brother Jun, why are you so stingy today?

108
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,940
You are not like this in the hospital.

109
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,940
Don't I usually be active?

110
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,940
I am usually very active.

111
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,940
No, half a year, six months.

112
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,940
You said that Chinese medicine health center

113
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,940
is not just built on my six months of hard work?

114
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,940
How many years?

115
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,940
I'm that giant.

116
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
They are standing on my shoulder.

117
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
That little boy.

118
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,940
That's luck.

119
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,940
That's not strength, right?

120
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,940
Liu Jin, patients come to the hospital to see a doctor.

121
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,940
They hope that the medicine can be treated and solved at once.

122
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,940
That's normal, right?

123
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,940
And they have a little expectation for doctors.

124
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,940
Is that hard to understand?

125
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,940
I don't think there's a problem.

126
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,940
But Brother Jun, that's the god.

127
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,940
That's not a doctor.

128
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,940
Anyway, I don't care.

129
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
When Aunt Zheng comes again,

130
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
I have to talk to her about

131
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,940
the difference between Chinese medicine and massage spa.

132
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,940
Yes, okay.

133
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,940
You can try it out.

134
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,940
Gui, come out.

135
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,940
Why did you put it in here?

136
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,940
You don't want to stay at home either, right?

137
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,940
This is not my home.

138
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,940
What?

139
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,940
Braised pork with soy beans, boiled pork with water, steamed pork with flour.

140
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,940
I don't have any interest.

141
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,940
I don't have any interest.

142
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,940
Why do you remember so clearly?

143
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,940
Don't be so anxious.

144
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,940
You smoke and barbecue every day.

145
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,940
You drink a lot of water and eat light food.

146
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,940
Remember to wear a mask.

147
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Don't take care of you after you get a disease.

148
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,940
And the lung is seriously ill.

149
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,940
You're going to take a ventilator to barbecue in the second half of your life.

150
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,940
I'm talking to you.

151
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,940
Okay, I got it.

152
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,940
I'm leaving.

153
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,940
Okay, I'll go.

154
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,940
Be careful.

155
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,940
Okay.

156
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,940
New dishes are good.

157
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
Okay.

158
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Are you full?

159
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,940
I'm full.

160
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
I bought you fried food.

161
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,940
So obvious.

162
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,940
I don't want this age.

163
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,940
You want a purple sweet potato, I'll find it for you.

164
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,940
It's a little far away, it's hard to find.

165
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,940
I'll send it to you.

166
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,940
Eat medicine.

167
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,940
Where is this?

168
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,940
I'm leaving.

169
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,940
Take care.

170
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,940
Okay, take care.

171
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,940
Okay.

172
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,940
I bought you the first purple sweet potato in the world, Taozi Jiang.

173
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,940
I found that shop.

174
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,940
I'm leaving.

175
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
I'm leaving.

176
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
I'm leaving.

177
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
I'm leaving.

178
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,940
I'm leaving.

179
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,940
I'm leaving.

180
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
I'm leaving.

181
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
I'm leaving.

182
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,940
I'm leaving.

183
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,940
I'm leaving.

184
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,940
I'm leaving.

185
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
I'm leaving.

186
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,940
I'm leaving.

187
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,940
I'm leaving.

188
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,940
I'm leaving.

189
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,940
I'm leaving.

190
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,940
I'm leaving.

191
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,940
I'm leaving.

192
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,940
I'm leaving.

193
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,940
I'm leaving.

194
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,940
I'm leaving.

195
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,940
I'm leaving.

196
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,940
I'm leaving.

197
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,940
I'm leaving.

198
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,940
I'm leaving.

199
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,940
I'm leaving.

200
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
I'm leaving.

201
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,940
I'm leaving.

202
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
I'm leaving.

203
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,940
I'm leaving.

204
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
Sis Chun.

205
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,940
What?

206
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,380
I don't think TV is working.

207
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,980
There's a screen.

208
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,500
Just watch it.

209
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,380
It's all bloody.

210
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,660
I can't see clearly.

211
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,020
Then give me a TV.

212
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,780
No, no.

213
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,980
I can watch it even if I have to.

214
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,020
Ms. Zhou.

215
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,660
Guan is here to pay for her.

216
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,580
Red and red, two bowls of rice.

217
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,420
Chicken and rice, one bowl.

218
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,860
Don't you think it's weird?

219
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,860
What's wrong with them?

220
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,140
They don't want to eat with you.

221
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,420
So they take her home.

222
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,100
You think she'll be kind to you?

223
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,500
I'll eat it myself.

224
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,060
Ms. Zhou, one bowl of beef and sausage.

225
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,620
We're really in the same boat.

226
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,580
This time, Yizhen

227
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,940
met the Central Hospital again.

228
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,740
Our sports meeting

229
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,340
has been the second place for seven years.

230
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,820
She's not even a little bit

231
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,060
short-tempered.

232
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,100
It's normal.

233
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,140
How about we do

234
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,500
some small moves this time?

235
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,620
No.

236
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,700
If we want to win, we should win openly.

237
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,580
I agree.

238
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Can you be a little bit gentler?

239
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,940
Ms. Zhou.

240
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,860
Give me another pig's foot powder.

241
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,820
Let me nourish it.

242
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,820
Great.

243
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,780
Although Guan Xu is worried,

244
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,620
he still has a big thing to revenge.

245
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,060
He needs to cheer up.

246
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,140
This thing

247
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,940
has to start a few months ago.

248
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,940
The top colleagues in our hospital

249
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,620
have been selected

250
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,900
by the regional medical team sports meeting.

251
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,300
They will enter the final group competition.

252
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,540
Lin.

253
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,180
Look.

254
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,460
The Central Hospital is the first place

255
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,180
in the competition every year.

256
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,940
You should be more gentler this year.

257
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,340
Actually, the name doesn't matter.

258
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,140
The second place in the competition

259
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,180
is the first place.

260
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,140
Yes.

261
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,260
Let's cheer up together.

262
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,060
Let's work hard together.

263
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,780
Okay.

264
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,260
Come on.

265
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,060
Come on.

266
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,260
The first place.

267
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,540
We must win this year.

268
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,340
Come on.

269
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,940
Of course.

270
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,900
You were the second place in the previous year.

271
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,860
You must be the first place this year.

272
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,980
Don't just talk about winning.

273
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,500
You should be more practical.

274
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,220
Come on.

275
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,260
One, two, three.

276
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,140
Come on.

277
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,780
We are only half a meter away.

278
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,380
We won in the first two or three groups.

279
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,420
I'm telling you the truth.

280
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,020
I spent so much money on the supermarket.

281
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,060
Don't talk nonsense.

282
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,500
We are half a meter away from the starting line.

283
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,780
They are half a meter away from the middle line.

284
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,740
Can we win?

285
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,340
How's your sword?

286
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,700
I can't win if he doesn't go.

287
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,740
Stop talking nonsense.

288
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,780
The last round is just another round.

289
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,340
Come on.

290
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,140
Come on.

291
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,100
Come on.

292
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:19,740
Come on.

293
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,940
Come on.

294
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,140
I'm ready.

295
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,100
Can we win?

296
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:23,900
Come on.

297
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,620
I'm ready.

298
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,820
Come on.

299
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,460
Come on.

300
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,260
It's starting.

301
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,140
It's starting.

302
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:28,780
Come on.

303
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,140
It's starting.

304
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,060
Come on.

305
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,260
Come on.

306
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,260
Come on.

307
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,500
Come on.

308
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,500
Come on.

309
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,380
Come on.

310
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,940
Come on.

311
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,540
Come on.

312
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,460
Come on.

313
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,500
Come on.

314
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Come on!

315
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Come on!

316
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Come on!

317
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Come on!

318
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Come on!

319
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Come on!

320
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Come on!

321
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Come on!

322
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Come on!

323
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Come on!

324
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Come on!

325
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Come on!

326
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Come on!

327
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Come on!

328
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Come on!

329
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Come on!

330
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Come on!

331
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Come on!

332
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Come on!

333
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Come on!

334
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Come on!

335
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Come on!

336
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Come on!

337
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Come on!

338
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Come on!

339
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Come on!

340
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Come on!

341
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Come on!

342
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Go, go, go!

343
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Go, go, go!

344
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Central Hospital wins!

345
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Go, go, go!

346
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Go, go, go!

347
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Go, go, go!

348
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
The god of steel is too much.

349
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
You're not in the middle.

350
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
You can't see it, but I can.

351
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
What did you see? He's too much.

352
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
You just don't want to brag.

353
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I said the winner is the Central Hospital.

354
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
What's there to argue about in your hospital?

355
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Just take the second place.

356
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Do you know what a public competition is?

357
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
You're a scoundrel!

358
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
I'll tell you later.

359
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Come here, Fei Jing. Help me take a picture.

360
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Okay, sir.

361
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Jun is always a man who doesn't like to take pictures.

362
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
But that day, he took a picture with the first prize.

363
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
It made me understand.

364
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
One, two, three.

365
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Sometimes, it's for the sake of our own fairness.

366
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Come on, take a picture.

367
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
A sense of social dignity.

368
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
It's a sense of social dignity?

369
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Sixth Sense can be a joke in life.

370
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,500
But Yu Shi should be more interested in proving that he misunderstood the choice.

371
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
There are a lot of things to do this afternoon.

372
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
I'll take advantage of everyone's lunch break

373
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
to arrange a joint operation.

374
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Chen Minglan, I know lunch break is expensive.

375
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
If you don't sigh, I won't even be able to use five minutes.

376
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,500
This time, we're doing a joint operation with the Central Hospital's new internal medicine.

377
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
The time is nine o'clock in the morning.

378
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
So before eight thirty,

379
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,500
these things, especially the table, chair, horizontal and horizontal,

380
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,500
these things have to be in place before the time is set.

381
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Then, apart from some daily work arrangements,

382
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
we have some special...

383
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
What's wrong?

384
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
The director said that this time,

385
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
I'll help write the publicity.

386
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
So I thought you were having a meeting, so I came to listen.

387
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
You continue.

388
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Okay.

389
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
I didn't tell you.

390
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Wait a minute.

391
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Sorry.

392
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
You say it.

393
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Yes, this gift, Xia Yun.

394
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
I remember that the last time we had a meeting,

395
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
there were some gifts left.

396
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Then you can organize those again.

397
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
We can still use them this time.

398
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
What's wrong with you?

399
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
I heard Xia say that you were preparing some small gifts.

400
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
These things are on me.

401
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Our budget is limited.

402
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
That's not the matter.

403
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
I'm a little king of the green mountains and the green rivers, right?

404
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
I promise to let the residents' friends who came to the meeting

405
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
to prepare small gifts for our community hospital.

406
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
I won't give up, I won't give up.

407
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
I won't give up.

408
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Okay, thank you.

409
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Then you'll be responsible for this with Xia Yun.

410
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
By the way, Gao Yang,

411
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:28,120
you contact the director of the

412
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
I'm sorry.

413
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
You'll be responsible for this later.

414
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Jun, your accent is pretty good.

415
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
For example?

416
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
Green mountains and green rivers.

417
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:45,120
Great!

418
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Isn't it good?

419
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Very good.

420
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
It's very good, right?

421
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
Yes, yes, yes, very good.

422
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Your idea is very good.

423
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
This specific content,

424
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
do you think you have to think about it again?

425
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
Think about it again?

426
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Do you think the direction is right?

427
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
The direction is very right.

428
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Okay, okay, okay, I'll think about it again.

429
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
Think about it again.

430
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Green mountains and green rivers are great.

431
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Look.

432
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
You're not busy today?

433
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Busy, when am I not busy?

434
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Didn't you come?

435
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,120
I'll go home and say that I know so many people in the community hospital.

436
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
No one came to say hello to you.

437
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
I'll be here on Friday.

438
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,120
Your mouth is not at all at fault.

439
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
Did you quarrel with Yu Shi again?

440
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,120
I told you many times.

441
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
Look at this age.

442
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
Uncle, go out to travel and travel.

443
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
Which one is not better than quarrel?

444
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
You're criticizing me?

445
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
It's all my fault.

446
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Are you all right?

447
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
I dare not.

448
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
I just said he was your little mink.

449
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
You two don't always quarrel.

450
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Little mink?

451
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,120
You go ask this little mink.

452
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Is he going to rebel?

453
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
He doesn't want to be this little mink.

454
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
He wants to be a little star.

455
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
Hurry up and get through the wind.

456
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
You have a pretty good mouth.

457
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
Come, let me ask you.

458
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
That little star used to work in Sanjiajuan.

459
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
The nurse.

460
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
I remember you know him too.

461
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
Do you know him?

462
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Don't pretend.

463
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Give me his address and phone number.

464
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
I'll send him a little radish.

465
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Don't ask me for medicine.

466
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Why are you so good?

467
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,120
You're not good at this.

468
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
You're afraid of this little star?

469
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
You don't know your own daughter.

470
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
This is a little star.

471
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,120
This is a little star.

472
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
I'll give you a girl.

473
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
She'll be with me later.

474
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Okay, okay, okay.

475
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Hurry up and give it to me.

476
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Don't tell your dad I'm a criminal.

477
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
I know.

478
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
He just knows to fight in the house.

479
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,120
You said he was kicked out by others.

480
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,120
I didn't see him fight back.

481
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Who dares to say that?

482
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
You're playing tricks again.

483
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
I don't know about your work.

484
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
You have to go to work every day.

485
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
A doctor is not like a doctor.

486
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
A nurse is not like a nurse.

487
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
You're always in the way.

488
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
I'm going to tell people what you're doing.

489
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
I can't make it clear.

490
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,120
How can't you make it clear?

491
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
We'll solve it in two steps.

492
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
It's a headache.

493
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
It's a doctor.

494
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Okay, okay, okay.

495
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
I'm telling you.

496
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,120
I'm not worth it for you.

497
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
You've been in school for so many years.

498
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
You don't go to the three-pronged hospital.

499
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
How many people want to work there?

500
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
You have to wait in line outside.

501
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
You're here to suffer this.

502
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
What's wrong with me?

503
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
You're here again.

504
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
I'm so angry.

505
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Okay, you're all good friends.

506
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
I'm not going to talk to you.

507
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
I'm leaving.

508
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
I sent it.

509
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,120
I sent it on your phone.

510
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
I'm leaving.

511
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
Bye.

512
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Bye.

513
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Aunt.

514
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
Aunt.

515
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
It's all done.

516
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
It's done.

517
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
You work so hard.

518
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,120
It's hard enough.

519
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
Look at your face.

520
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
You've lost weight.

521
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Really?

522
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,120
I'm on a diet recently.

523
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
I love sweet food.

524
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
I have to control it.

525
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
What's there to control?

526
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
This job is a lot of suffering.

527
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
Don't let it suffer again.

528
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,120
I won't.

529
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,120
I know.

530
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,120
I'll take you to my house one day.

531
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
I'll make you something delicious.

532
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Okay, thank you.

533
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Aunt.

534
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Bye.

535
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Bye.

536
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Dr. Xia.

537
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Do you know that aunt?

538
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
That's Director Yu's mother.

539
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
What's wrong?

540
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,120
It's her.

541
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Let's go, Jun.

542
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
I'll burn you.

543
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Where are they?

544
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Don't you know?

545
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
They're so regular.

546
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
They just got off work.

547
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,120
For the current house,

548
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
it should be better.

549
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
I'll give you a discount.

550
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
If you have any questions,

551
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
you can call me.

552
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Hello, sir.

553
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Are you buying a house or renting it?

554
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Do you have a salesman called Wang Li?

555
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
Or Wang Li?

556
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Wang Li.

557
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
He just went out today.

558
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
How about I introduce him to you?

559
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
They're the same.

560
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
How long has he been back?

561
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
I don't know.

562
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
What are you doing here?

563
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
What are you doing here?

564
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Come out with me.

565
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Come out.

566
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
What are you doing here?

567
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
What can you do if you find that person?

568
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Fight?

569
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Fight?

570
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,120
It's not normal to be bullied in work.

571
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Can you find everyone?

572
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Why are you here?

573
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Are you buying a house or renting it?

574
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Are you buying a house or renting it?

575
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
I haven't finished yet.

576
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,120
What are you doing?

577
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
I'm not here to fight.

578
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
I just want Wang Li

579
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
to apologize to Director Yu

580
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
in front of Director Yu's mother.

581
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
I've been an intern,

582
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
and I've been scolded by patients,

583
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
and I've been questioned by their families.

584
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
But you know what?

585
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
This kind of thing

586
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
is another matter

587
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
if it's known by your family.

588
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
The delivery is here.

589
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
What else did your sister say?

590
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Is it delicious?

591
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Is it broken?

592
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
Stinky temper.

593
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
You don't say thank you

594
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
even if you receive the delivery.

595
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Even strangers know it

596
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
and say thank you.

597
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
You're the one who sent the message.

598
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
I'm sorry.

599
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
You're so busy.

600
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
You don't tell your mother.

601
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
You let her nag me every day.

602
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Stop playing.

603
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Is this the time to play this?

604
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
What if I get hit?

605
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
You can't hit anyone.

606
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
Why do you

607
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
live with such a lucky mind every day?

608
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
I haven't said you.

609
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
Do you like Yu's?

610
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
So heart-wrenching.

611
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Director Yu is my leader.

612
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Not to mention that

613
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
he brought me out to work

614
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
to make this happen.

615
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
I have to take care of it.

616
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
I haven't said you.

617
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
You're everywhere

618
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
like a nobody every day.

619
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Yu is my childhood friend.

620
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
If I don't solve it for him,

621
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
who will help him?

622
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
Then you solve it.

623
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
Stop playing.

624
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
What should I do?

625
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
What do you say?

626
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
I didn't expect to meet you

627
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
when I came here.

628
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
I didn't expect to meet you

629
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
when I came here either.

630
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Let's take care of this.

631
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
We rent a house and buy a house.

632
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
If you need it,

633
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
please call me.

634
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Brother.

635
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Director, if you need it,

636
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
please call me.

637
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Wang, if you need it,

638
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
please call me.

639
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Look at his job.

640
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
He doesn't like it.

641
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
I guess he doesn't like it

642
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
because he doesn't like others.

643
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Of course I know.

644
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
I just got it.

645
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
I haven't opened it yet.

646
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
I'll call mom.

647
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
What's wrong?

648
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
You're familiar with work again?

649
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
I told you to change jobs but you didn't listen.

650
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
Did you get fired this time

651
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
or get scolded?

652
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
I'm just annoyed with this.

653
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
Working near my house,

654
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
I didn't see anything.

655
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
I can see you get fired

656
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
even when I go to a friend's house.

657
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,120
28 or whatever,

658
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
you can call me anytime.

659
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
Thank you.

660
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
You can also send me your WeChat.

661
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
No need.

662
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
It's not convenient.

663
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Sorry.

664
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
I'm sorry.

665
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
It's okay.

666
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Please listen to me.

667
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
It's okay.

668
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
I think it's like us.

669
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
It's like us.

670
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
It's like us.

671
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
It's like us.

672
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
It's like us.

673
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
It's like us.

674
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
It's like us.

675
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
It's like us.

676
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
It's like us.

677
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,120
Sir, are you okay?

678
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Sir.

679
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,120
He's choking.

680
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
What's wrong?

681
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
What should we do?

682
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
Call 120.

683
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Hello?

684
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Hurry up.

685
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
Call 120.

686
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
He's choking.

687
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
Get off the stage.

688
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Get off the stage.

689
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
Is he choking?

690
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Come here.

691
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
Come here.

692
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Hurry up.

693
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Don't be in here.

694
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Get up.

695
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Stand still.

696
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Get up.

697
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Don't be in here.

698
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
Use the man-to-man.

699
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
It's okay.

700
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
Let him go.

701
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Stop looking.

702
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Are you okay, bro?

703
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Are you scared?

704
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
Thank you.

705
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
It's okay.

706
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Drink some water.

707
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Drink some water.

708
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
Wang Li, right?

709
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
How do you know?

710
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
Do you know each other?

711
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
It's me.

712
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
I went to your house with our director yesterday.

713
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
I was kicked out before I finished talking.

714
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
What a coincidence.

715
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
It's not a coincidence.

716
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,120
I came to see you on purpose.

717
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,120
You probably had some misunderstandings yesterday.

718
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,120
I'm going to introduce you to the doctor of the community hospital.

719
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
You can come to us when you meet a cat or a little patient.

720
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
You can find this guy.

721
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
That's right.

722
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Our community hospital is located in every corner of this community.

723
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,120
It only takes fifteen minutes at most.

724
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
So if you have any problems in the future,

725
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
especially health problems,

726
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
you can call the service line of our community hospital.

727
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Our community hospital is the health gatekeeper of the whole community residents.

728
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,120
So you may have some misunderstandings yesterday.

729
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
But we all respect each other.

730
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,120
Actually, I'm not good at exploring.

731
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
But people like me,

732
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
I'm not the only one.

733
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
I don't care about you.

734
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
I don't care about this guy.

735
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
I don't care about you.

736
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,120
I don't care about many people in this business.

737
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
Can you manage it?

738
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
For example, in this society,

739
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
rich people look down on the poor.

740
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Those who work in the office look down on us.

741
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Those who make money on the street.

742
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Those who use their brains look down on the hardworking.

743
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
I'm not that noble.

744
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Others think I'm a trash can.

745
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,120
It's hard for me to have no complaints.

746
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,120
Actually, I want to respect everyone.

747
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
But who will respect me?

748
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Is there anyone who wants to buy a house?

749
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
50% off for the commission.

750
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Doctor, what a good job.

751
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Honest,

752
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
earn a lot of money,

753
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
and be respected.

754
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,120
You don't know how cold the winter wind is in Xingcheng.

755
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,120
It's like a needle.

756
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,120
It's going into your bone.

757
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,120
You've never felt the 40-degree high temperature

758
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
and the outside of the room.

759
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
You're shocked.

760
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
Anyway, as long as not everyone

761
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
is throwing it on the ground in front of me,

762
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
I'm so grateful.

763
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
I dare not add eggs

764
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
when I eat fried noodles after work at night.

765
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
I'm sorry.

766
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Do you know why I was

767
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
stuffed with dumplings today?

768
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
This is my first meal today.

769
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
I'm over 30 years old.

770
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
And my dad cried for me.

771
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
I'm so embarrassed.

772
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Can you understand?

773
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Yes.

774
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Maybe you don't know much about us,

775
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
the doctors in our community.

776
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
It feels like we're in the office every day.

777
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
In fact, the doctors in our community

778
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,120
are different from the doctors in ordinary hospitals.

779
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
How cold the wind is in Xingcheng,

780
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
how hot it is in summer in Xingcheng,

781
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
we're all outside.

782
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Do you think the work looks decent

783
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
is actually the same as you?

784
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Experiencers are not understood

785
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
or respected, right?

786
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,120
Get out of the way.

787
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Do you think I'm angry after I'm angry?

788
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,120
I'm sure I'm angry.

789
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
But they're sick.

790
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
They're not feeling well.

791
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Their families are more anxious than me.

792
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
I told you not to come here.

793
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,120
The hospital is long.

794
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
What can you do here?

795
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,120
We can laugh when we understand each other.

796
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Keep encouraging ourselves.

797
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
In life,

798
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
there is no time to give us experience

799
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
and not to teach us.

800
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
In fact,

801
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
we're just community doctors.

802
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,120
Everyone has their own mission.

803
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
The bricklayer has to make it hard for the bricklayer.

804
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
How about this, bro?

805
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
I'll give you the orders

806
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
that you can't send.

807
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
Give it to me.

808
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,120
I know many street neighbors and bosses.

809
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
I'll give these to them

810
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
and let them help you.

811
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
You have to help me.

812
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,120
What's the name of the survey?

813
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Public Health and Health Research.

814
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Yes.

815
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,120
You have to fill out the survey form for me.

816
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,120
I'll treat you to a fried rice with an egg.

817
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Is that okay?

818
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
I'll pay for it today.

819
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
No, no.

820
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
You're welcome.

821
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Come on.

822
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
We're not welcome.

823
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Let's just say it.

824
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
Okay?

825
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
Okay.

826
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
Everyone has his own way

827
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
to see the world.

828
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Many people will

829
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
define the value of others

830
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
without knowing it.

831
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
The hospital is next door.

832
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Let's take a look.

833
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
How long will it take?

834
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Forget it.

835
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
I'll stay here for two days.

836
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
I can't go to the people's hospital.

837
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
I'll just do a full-scale checkup.

838
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
The equipment there

839
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,120
is more complete than the one here.

840
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
Hurry up.

841
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
It's almost impossible to change

842
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,120
everyone's general understanding

843
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
of this world

844
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
in a moment.

845
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
Hello.

846
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Is this Gu Jia Bao from Xin Yue District?

847
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Yes.

848
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Where are you?

849
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,120
I'm a doctor

850
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
at Qingshan Green Water Community

851
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Health Service Center.

852
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
Your physical examination report

853
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
is coming out.

854
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
When will you come and get it?

855
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
I don't have time.

856
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Here's the thing.

857
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
We saw you have several indicators.

858
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
It seems that the indicators

859
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
are not very good.

860
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
So we suggest that

861
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
you can focus on the review.

862
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
There are problems.

863
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
The whole family has problems.

864
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Perhaps there is no need

865
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
to change ourselves.

866
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
Our nervousness,

867
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
worry, and worries

868
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
are just

869
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,120
small things that are not worth mentioning.

870
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
Hello.

871
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Is this Jiang Wei from Xin Yue District?

872
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
It seems that

873
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,120
this is how work is.

874
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
It makes us

875
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
spend our energy in a moment.

876
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,120
In a moment,

877
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
we can feel our passion

878
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
again.

879
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Ms. Zheng.

880
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
You Jing.

881
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,120
Why are you hiding?

882
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
The hospital is just a little bit bigger.

883
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
When you get better,

884
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
your neck will be better.

885
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
And your neck will be better.

886
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
You will have to spend money to treat it.

887
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Okay. Okay. Okay.

888
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,120
I got it.

889
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
Well.

890
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
The massage center.

891
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
You can go there if you want.

892
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
But I want to remind you.

893
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
No matter how

894
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,120
they talk,

895
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
as long as you charge,

896
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
you can't believe

897
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,120
that it's their trick.

898
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
The purpose is

899
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
to do everything to make money.

900
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

901
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,120
If you spend money

902
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
and you can't treat it,

903
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,120
I can't help you.

904
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
I...

905
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
I just came to get some medicine.

906
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
Well.

907
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
I'll go get some medicine.

908
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
Okay. Go ahead.

909
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
I'm leaving.

910
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
Ms. Zheng.

911
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
This is the pharmacy.

912
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
The pharmacy is over there.

913
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
Look. I'm confused.

914
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
I'll go there.

915
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
Okay.

916
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Go ahead.

917
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Later, we all understand one thing.

918
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,120
We can't change others.

919
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,120
But we can change ourselves.

920
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Life is a play.

921
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Others are angry with me.

922
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
I'm not angry.

923
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,120
No one is angry when the anger comes from the disease.

924
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,120
If I'm angry to death, who can do it?

925
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
That's it.

926
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,120
No worries

927
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,120
can't be solved by a barbecue.

928
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
If there is,

929
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
then...

930
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Let's play mahjong.

931
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Let's play mahjong.

932
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
Why don't we go back to work?

933
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
We have nothing to do.

934
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Okay.

935
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
Let's go.

936
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
Of course, you can also play the game at home.

937
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,120
Pay attention to the layout.

938
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
Don't disturb the people.

939
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
What are you doing?

940
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Are you crazy?

941
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,120
You have to learn to protect yourself.

942
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,120
Otherwise, what can you do?

943
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Life has to go on.

944
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Life has to be full of hope.

945
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
I'll go back to the store later.

946
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Director.

947
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
We didn't investigate that store.

948
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
We have time to make an appointment.

949
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,120
We'll go together.

950
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Aren't you surprised?

951
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
What's so surprising?

952
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
It's normal.

953
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Okay.

954
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Let's have dinner together.

955
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,120
Let's welcome Guan.

956
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Okay, director.

957
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Then when Ai Jing comes back,

958
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,120
we can have another meal.

959
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,120
You haven't eaten this meal yet.

960
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
What do you want to eat?

961
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Whatever you want to eat.

962
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
I can eat anything.

963
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Whatever you want to eat.

964
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
We'll eat spicy food.

965
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
The spicier, the better.

966
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,120
Gao Yang, you find one.

967
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Okay, director.

968
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
Gao Yang.

969
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
You are so punctual.

970
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,120
You sent me a video at noon.

971
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
I'm anxious.

972
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,120
I've checked all my tests.

973
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,120
It's been so many days.

974
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
Why are they still not here?

975
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,120
Why don't they let me out?

976
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,120
Am I really sick?

977
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,120
Am I having something wrong?

978
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
I have to open my eyes.

979
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,120
I can't tell you

980
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,120
about the stomach-wrenching thing.

981
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,120
Don't talk nonsense.

982
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,120
Tell me everything.

983
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,120
Send me the indicators.

984
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Listen to the hospital's words in the hospital.

985
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Okay?

986
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
You always joke with me.

987
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
How can you see the rainbow

988
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,120
if you don't experience the storm?

989
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,120
Right?

990
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
The more you worry,

991
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,120
the more your people will worry.

992
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,120
And your granddaughter

993
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
is not easy.

994
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,120
She's quite capable.

995
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,120
What can she do?

996
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
She'll be fine

997
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
when you ask her.

998
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,120
Don't worry.

999
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,120
Don't worry?

1000
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,120
I'm tired.

1001
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
Yes, I can understand you.

1002
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
So tell me if you have anything.

1003
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,120
I'll be your strong backing.

1004
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,120
Think about it.

1005
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
You're in the hospital.

1006
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
You should treat your disease.

1007
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,120
It's not easy for your people.

1008
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
They have to make decisions.

1009
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,120
And they have to take care of their families.

1010
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,120
Isn't it easier?

1011
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Mom, please.

1012
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,120
Please.

1013
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,120
Because you use WeChat.

1014
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,120
It's too early.

1015
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
It's too early.

1016
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,880
I want to drink the

1017
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,120
flying fish.

1018
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
Why are you so naughty?

1019
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
Go away.

1020
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,120
Have you paid?

1021
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,120
We're talking about money and love.

1022
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,120
Come here.

1023
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,120
Mom,

1024
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,120
I'm a man of status.

1025
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,120
If I can't get the sponsorship,

1026
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,120
I'll be embarrassed.

1027
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Right?

1028
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,120
It's not just a matter of face.

1029
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
It's also about

1030
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
my reputation in the hospital.

1031
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,120
You have the same reputation as me.

1032
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,120
You'll lose it if you let it go.

1033
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
Why don't you just slow it down?

1034
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,120
Stop yelling.

1035
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
I'm man of status.

1036
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
Don't make my situation worse.

1037
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,120
Of course.

1038
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,540
Of course.

1039
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
I have one more progress.

1040
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,120
Anesthesia treatment is for liposuction.

1041
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
At what age?

1042
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Two or three years old.

1043
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
Anesthesia treatment.

1044
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
Ten years old.

1045
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
Twenty.

1046
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
Fifteen.

1047
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
J Circumcise.

1048
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,720
Right?

1049
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,240
Do you want to see the new product?

1050
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,480
I'll pick it for you.

1051
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,440
You're so noisy.

1052
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,920
Liu Jin,

1053
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,120
don't let your mom get the card.

1054
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,000
Who is the best in treating diseases?

1055
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,720
Green Hills and Green Waters are the best.

1056
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,320
It seems a bit too arrogant.

1057
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,040
The heart and blood are together to fight for the best.

1058
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,000
Green Hills and Green Waters are the best.

1059
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,120
No, no.

1060
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,600
In the mountain, in the lake, in the water,

1061
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,840
Green Hills and Green Waters are hidden in the tiger's den.

1062
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,720
Dragon.

1063
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,240
Being healthy is the best.

1064
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,560
It's a bit expensive.

1065
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,040
How did you handle

1066
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,320
the example last time?

1067
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,680
This Wednesday at 10 o'clock in the morning,

1068
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,720
the first screening event

1069
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,400
will be held at the Fu Yi Building in Zhongmao City.

1070
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,080
Welcome all the friends of the people

1071
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,120
to come to consult on the health of the people.

1072
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,560
Is it on Wednesday?

1073
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,680
Go.

1074
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,960
You go.

1075
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,600
Make a decision quickly.

1076
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,000
Well,

1077
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,440
is there anything on Wednesday?

1078
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
You want to see me?

1079
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,240
This kid is...

1080
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,040
The disease is already very serious.

1081
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,440
Between surgery and conservative treatment,

1082
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
make a choice.

1083
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,640
Make the worst plan.

1084
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,240
You can't do this.

1085
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,640
You have to be big.

1086
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,840
This is the bottom line.

1087
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
Just a few pictures,

1088
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,640
what bottom line do you want?

1089
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,040
You have to stand out from our hospital.

1090
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,640
It can't be that kind of stand out.

1091
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,440
I want to change a color.

1092
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,240
But it can't be too obvious.

1093
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,440
I won't say anything.

1094
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,440
How about this?

1095
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,840
You move this little red flower

1096
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,040
to our hospital.

1097
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,240
Hurry up.

1098
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,640
Hurry up.

1099
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,440
Hurry up.

1100
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,240
Hurry up.

1101
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,040
Hurry up.

1102
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,840
Hurry up.

1103
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
Hurry up.

1104
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,640
Hurry up.

1105
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,440
Hurry up.

1106
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,240
Hurry up.

1107
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,040
Hurry up.

1108
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,840
Hurry up.

1109
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,640
Hurry up.

1110
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,440
Hurry up.

1111
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Hurry up.

1112
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
Hurry up.

1113
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
Hurry up.

1114
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,240
Hurry up.

1115
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
Hurry up.

1116
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Hurry up.

1117
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
Hurry up.

1118
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,240
Hurry up.

1119
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,240
Hurry up.

1120
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
Hurry up.

1121
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
Hurry up.

1122
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,840
Well,

1123
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,840
it's obvious.

1124
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
What's the use of this?

1125
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
What can you see?

1126
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,240
I can see it anyway.

1127
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
Master Yu,

1128
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,840
find someone to help.

1129
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,040
See if I can send you these things.

1130
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,440
Dr. Zhang,

1131
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,640
you wrote all these?

1132
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,240
Yes.

1133
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,440
If I knew you were so talented,

1134
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,240
I would have asked you to write the previous book.

1135
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
How long did you write this?

1136
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,840
I saw it and it was quite exciting.

1137
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,240
Not long.

1138
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,440
When I wrote the first draft,

1139
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,640
I wrote about

1140
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,040
more than 20,000 words.

1141
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,440
Then I got a little more excited.

1142
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,640
I chose more than 500 words

1143
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,440
and put them in this promotional book.

1144
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,240
Brother Jun,

1145
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,640
how much do you waste

1146
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,440
to change 20,000 into 500?

1147
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,840
Let me say you take those 20,000

1148
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,240
and fight with the central hospital.

1149
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,440
This is not good.

1150
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,040
It makes us look very good.

1151
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,240
And it's not a waste.

1152
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,440
We can use it for the next year.

1153
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
The year after next.

1154
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
The year after next.

1155
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,040
We can use it for all the years after next.

1156
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,040
That's right.

1157
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,640
We can reuse it.

1158
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Yes.

1159
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,240
The liter says bear,

1160
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,640
the poet says tyrant.

1161
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,240
Green mountains, green waters,

1162
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,240
the tyrant rules the world.

1163
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,040
Will this slogan be used?

1164
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,440
Not bad.

1165
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,440
Very good.

1166
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,640
Not bad.

1167
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,240
Let's put it

1168
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,440
at the gate, okay?

1169
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,640
Next.

1170
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,640
Like this.

1171
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,840
No, I still don't like it.

1172
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,040
Like this.

1173
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
You delete this.

1174
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
It's not fair.

1175
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,240
We have it, they don't.

1176
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,440
Delete it.

1177
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,240
It's off.

1178
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,640
Yes.

1179
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
I'm afraid you can't see it.

1180
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,840
Yes, it's a little bit off.

1181
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,440
Hello, Miss Yuan.

1182
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,240
This is the menu of this restaurant.

1183
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,240
Please have a look.

1184
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,840
Thank you.

1185
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,640
Your business is good.

1186
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,240
Good.

1187
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,640
You're an artist.

1188
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,440
What about them?

1189
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,840
They're working overtime today.

1190
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,440
I'll cut it for you.

1191
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,240
Such a big pot.

1192
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,640
Wait for me to order.

1193
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,640
Miss Yuan, what's this?

1194
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
Just a chicken drumstick.

1195
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:18,840
Thank you.

1196
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,240
The chicken is sold out.

1197
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,840
The taxi.

1198
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
You know each other?

1199
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,440
I know her.

1200
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
It's easy to know.

1201
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,240
You can't finish such a big pot.

1202
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,040
You two, together.

1203
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,640
Okay.

1204
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,040
Sit down.

1205
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,840
I'll bring you more money.

1206
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
You're good at business.

1207
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
I'll pay half the money.

1208
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,640
Half.

1209
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,240
This is another thing I should quiet myself down.

1210
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,840
You eat this too?

1211
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,040
I was a child, and I like to eat this.

1212
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,240
Xia Na,

1213
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,040
why are you squatting down here?

1214
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,640
Get up now.

1215
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,240
Have a look at my proficient cooking skills.

1216
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,840
A bowl of chicken is perfect for us.

1217
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,380
And serve with sirloin.

1218
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,180
Wedge?

1219
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,720
Tell me,

1220
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,140
what should we cook?

1221
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,180
Braised chicken with mainland...

1222
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,140
or fried chicken wings with ginger?

1223
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,080
jong, you can't eat this spicy dish.

1224
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,640
I did it Arbeit?

1225
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,080
Nonsense.

1226
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,400
It is so simple.

1227
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,040
Who would know it will rise once you eat it?

1228
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:49,720
Yes.

1229
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,240
Yes.

1230
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,720
Today we eat chicken.

1231
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,160
My dad used to feed me chicken when I was a kid.

1232
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,600
He said eating this

1233
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,600
will make you sweat.

1234
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,000
So it will cool down your blood.

1235
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,480
After he left,

1236
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,480
I tried to do it myself.

1237
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,880
Boss, can you leave me some?

1238
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,520
Chicken, I eat with you.

1239
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,080
One last good bite.

1240
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,040
Do you remember that?

1241
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,520
Sorry.

1242
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,360
Hurry up!

1243
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,160
What is it?

1244
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,040
It's okay.

1245
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,080
I'm not crying today.

1246
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,520
I'm sure I'm crying.

1247
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,320
I have to thank you again today.

1248
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,480
I'm leaving.

1249
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,200
Bye.

1250
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:50,800
Bye.

1251
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,320
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

1252
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,800
I'm Xu Jingxia,

1253
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,280
Mr. Shi's granddaughter.

1254
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,960
Grandpa's health is not very good.

1255
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,440
I know he often contacts you.

1256
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,120
I want to ask you for help.

1257
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,640
Next time he asks you,

1258
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,000
please help me

1259
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,360
to take care of him for a while.

1260
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,600
Hua.

1261
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,680
Hua.

1262
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,120
Your food arrived.

1263
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,600
What did began not to arrive...

1264
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,320
Back.

1265
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,640
Shut up.

1266
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,160
What's wrong?

1267
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,160
So many materials.

1268
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:04,840
It must be enough.

1269
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,240
Okay.

1270
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:05,880
It should be enough.

1271
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,520
But I still have some.

1272
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:06,920
I'll change it.

1273
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,440
Okay.

1274
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:16,960
Put it there.

1275
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,840
I'll help them.

1276
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,800
Put all the materials here.

1277
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,600
Xiaoyu.

1278
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,880
You have a lot of materials.

1279
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,320
This one.

1280
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:23,800
Yes.

1281
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,240
That guy looks sexy.

1282
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,920
He's strong and strong-willed.

1283
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,840
He looks like Zhou Zheng.

1284
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,000
How did you recruit him?

1285
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,960
We just hired him randomly.

1286
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,320
When he quits,

1287
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,720
you can introduce him to us.

1288
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,080
Don't bother.

1289
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,040
He'll work here

1290
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,840
for a long time.

1291
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,000
I'm just kidding.

1292
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,080
You dare to come?

1293
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,600
It's not funny.

1294
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,080
Have you informed the community?

1295
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,840
It's late.

1296
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,680
No one is here.

1297
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,280
Yes.

1298
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,800
Have you informed them?

1299
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,720
Yes.

1300
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,040
How did you inform them?

1301
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,720
I called them

1302
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,920
to inform the community committee.

1303
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,480
How did the committee inform them?

1304
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,200
I called them

1305
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,200
and they didn't inform me.

1306
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,200
Why didn't they reply?

1307
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,160
Aunt.

1308
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:08,760
You're here.

1309
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,320
We're going to the hospital for an event.

1310
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,000
Of course we have to attend.

1311
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,760
Did the committee inform you?

1312
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,400
You're still talking.

1313
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,280
If we didn't go to the hospital

1314
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,120
for an examination yesterday,

1315
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:18,800
we wouldn't know

1316
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,360
there's a whole body.

1317
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,480
You've been working for a long time.

1318
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,320
There's a supermarket downstairs

1319
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,880
for the anniversary of Zhou Lianqing's death.

1320
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,520
We should finish it earlier.

1321
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,920
We should go and have a look.

1322
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,000
It's starting.

1323
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,080
Let's go there

1324
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,040
and get some food.

1325
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,720
Okay.

1326
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,440
What's going on?

1327
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,200
I don't know.

1328
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,760
I'm buying a special gift for you.

1329
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,520
I'm buying a special gift for you.

1330
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,360
I'm buying a special gift for you.

1331
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,360
I'm buying a special gift for you.

1332
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,280
I'm buying a special gift for you.

1333
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,080
I'm buying a special gift for you.

1334
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,200
I'm buying a special gift for you.

1335
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,760
Here.

1336
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,320
I'll give a little present

1337
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,240
to you as a gift.

1338
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:49,920
Thank you.

1339
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,240
Here is the sometimes41 fact book I bought.

1340
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:59,760
Machao.

1341
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,440
What should I buy?

1342
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,200
Let's start.

1343
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,800
Start what?

1344
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,600
How can we start if we can't find him?

1345
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Director Lin will talk about

1346
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,800
the prevention of heart disease later.

1347
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,000
We have to fall asleep.

1348
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,000
We can't do anything if we keep going on.

1349
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,000
What should we do?

1350
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,400
Let's go to the hot spot.

1351
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,200
I'm going to the hot spot.

1352
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,000
Let's go to the hot spot.

1353
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,200
Okay, come on.

1354
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,200
I'll do it.

1355
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,000
Gao, Gao, come on.

1356
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,200
Let's go to see him.

1357
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,200
Let's go.

1358
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,200
Come on, come on, hurry up.

1359
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,200
Hurry up.

1360
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,200
It's okay.

1361
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,800
Go ahead.

1362
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,200
I'm going to the hot spot.

1363
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Why? I'm not going.

1364
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,400
Go ahead.

1365
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,200
Go ahead.

1366
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,600
Come on.

1367
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,000
Hurry up.

1368
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,200
Hurry up.

1369
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I'm going.

1370
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,200
I'm going.

1371
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,200
I'm going.

1372
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,400
Someone is coming.

1373
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,400
Say hello to him.

1374
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,800
Come on, come on.

1375
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,400
Come on, come on, come on.

1376
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Come on, come on.

1377
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,400
Let's be quiet.

1378
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,800
Let's be quiet.

1379
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,400
Let's chat for a while.

1380
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,400
I'm not going.

1381
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,400
Stand still.

1382
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,800
It's okay.

1383
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,400
It's just a step away from work.

1384
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,600
You think I'm a fool?

1385
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:52,580
You can take the free

1386
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,580
What are you doing?

1387
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,580
Give it to me.

1388
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,580
But

1389
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:00,980
the video of the horse

1390
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,580
has been sent to your

1391
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,380
business group,

1392
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,580
sister group.

1393
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:06,980
You're advertising?

1394
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,580
This is called publicity.

1395
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:12,980
This is the right one.

1396
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,380
So you can't be too excited.

1397
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:20,780
Sit down now.

1398
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:21,780
Come on, come on, come on.

1399
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,580
Come on.

1400
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,780
The show is called Love is a Heart.

1401
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,980
Leave a message on the phone.

1402
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,380
There are small gifts for you.

1403
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,380
Come here.

1404
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,380
This way is also okay.

1405
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:30,780
Free.

1406
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,980
Love is a Heart.

1407
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,180
Leave a message on the phone.

1408
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,380
There are small gifts for you.

1409
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:34,980
How old are you?

1410
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,980
How old are you?

1411
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,980
I'm still one year old.

1412
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,780
I'm a year old.

1413
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,780
Come here.

1414
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,980
Come to receive the prize.

1415
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,180
There are gifts over there.

1416
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,380
You can receive the gifts over there.

1417
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:43,980
Yes.

1418
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,780
Come on.

1419
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,980
It's hard to sit down.

1420
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:50,980
Sit here.

1421
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,380
Okay, see you next time.

1422
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,780
Bye bye.

1423
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,380
Minglan.

1424
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,780
Today,

1425
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,580
you can make a statistics

1426
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,780
of the number of people who signed the contract.

1427
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,980
Send it to the director Zhou.

1428
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,180
Now go to the mall with me.

1429
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,580
You can go to the staff

1430
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,980
and receive today's invitation.

1431
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,780
You go first.

1432
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,580
I'll go to you later.

1433
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,180
Okay.

1434
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,180
Director Yu.

1435
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:24,780
Today,

1436
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,780
I came to apologize to you.

1437
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,380
Don't take it to heart

1438
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,580
about that day.

1439
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,380
I won't.

1440
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,380
It's okay.

1441
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,780
I'll go to the mall with you.

1442
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,580
Okay.

1443
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,380
I'll go to the staff and receive the invitation.

1444
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,380
Okay.

1445
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,780
I'll go to the staff and receive the invitation.

1446
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,580
Okay.

1447
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,180
I'll go to the staff and receive the invitation.

1448
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,180
Okay.

1449
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,580
I'll go to the staff and receive the invitation.

1450
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,580
Actually, this is also part of my job.

1451
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,180
I've done it for a long time.

1452
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,780
But

1453
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,780
maybe my family

1454
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,780
still can't understand it.

1455
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,980
So it's also to

1456
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,780
make them more at ease.

1457
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,180
I think I have to do this.

1458
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,980
Please do me a favor.

1459
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:09,980
Okay?

1460
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,180
Well,

1461
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,580
I and my father

1462
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,780
are willing to participate in

1463
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:23,180
the research of our community hospital.

1464
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,180
President Jiu,

1465
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,380
you want me to see

1466
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,580
this?

1467
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,380
No.

1468
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,580
Sit down.

1469
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,580
Sit down.

1470
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,180
I just want you to see

1471
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,180
how much Director Yu loves you

1472
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,780
and tell you not to worry about it.

1473
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,180
I worry about it?

1474
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,380
My daughter is old.

1475
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,780
What's the use of worrying about it?

1476
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,980
I'm good for her.

1477
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,380
She doesn't know it.

1478
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,780
Look.

1479
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,780
You're here again.

1480
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,780
Good for her.

1481
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,580
Yes. If you're good for her,

1482
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,780
you have to listen to her

1483
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,980
and listen to her.

1484
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,580
Right?

1485
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,780
If you're good for her,

1486
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,780
you can't force her

1487
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,780
to follow your plan.

1488
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,980
Once she can't meet your expectations,

1489
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,180
she'll make a mistake.

1490
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,580
How can it be?

1491
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,780
She's better than you think.

1492
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,980
You've grown up.

1493
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,380
You're on your own.

1494
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,380
Right?

1495
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,980
Am I very reasonable?

1496
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,580
I finally know it.

1497
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:18,980
So why can't she

1498
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,980
stand to hit you?

1499
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,180
She's reasonable.

1500
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,780
She's been hitting me since I was a kid.

1501
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,580
Who can bully her?

1502
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,780
Besides,

1503
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,780
I'll protect her.

1504
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,380
I'll tell her

1505
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,980
about what I saw.

1506
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:40,780
I know.

1507
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,380
Why are you so angry?

1508
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,980
I know.

1509
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,980
I know.

1510
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,980
She's so ugly.

1511
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,980
I know.

1512
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,180
You're so...

1513
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,980
Don't worry.

1514
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,380
You're so good.

1515
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,580
She came to apologize.

1516
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,180
Stop pretending.

1517
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,780
She told me

1518
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,380
that two doctors from the community hospital

1519
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,580
ran over and were

1520
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,180
so kind and nice.

1521
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,380
She's so free.

1522
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,580
I know those two doctors.

1523
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,580
They're so generous.

1524
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,980
They'll never be generous again.

1525
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,780
Thank you so much.

1526
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,780
Listen.

1527
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,580
Don't fight with your mom.

1528
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,780
Don't let me know.

1529
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,380
You're having a good time.

1530
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,580
I've worked so hard for you.

1531
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,580
Fine.

1532
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,580
I won't give you this chance.

1533
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,980
Did you make an appointment?

1534
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,980
I think it's about time.

1535
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,180
Yes.

1536
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,180
You should show me the result.

1537
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,980
I don't want to worry about it.

1538
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,180
I'm afraid you'll miss the time.

1539
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,180
Fine.

1540
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,980
I'll send it to you.

1541
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,180
Tell me

1542
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,780
if you win this time.

1543
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,780
Who's that?

1544
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,180
Dr. Zhao.

1545
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:04,980
Dr. Zhao.

1546
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:05,980
Come on.

1547
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,780
Let's take a picture.

1548
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,380
Dr. Zhao, let's take a picture.

1549
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,780
Let's take a picture.

1550
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,780
Okay.

1551
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,580
Let's take a picture.

1552
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,580
Come on.

1553
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:16,580
Okay, everyone, look at me.

1554
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,780
Three, two, one.

1555
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,580
Let's go.

1556
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,380
Hello.

1557
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,980
Lin.

1558
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,580
I've received the picture.

1559
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,380
I haven't seen it yet.

1560
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,180
I'm sure you'll be satisfied.

1561
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,780
You know, your Central Hospital is really excellent.

1562
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,180
Yes.

1563
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:52,380
Let's keep working hard next year.

1564
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,380
Okay.

1565
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,180
Bye.

1566
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,780
Zhao Dongcheng.

1567
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:10,580
I told you to get Yu Yan's face back.

1568
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,580
Where's your face?

1569
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,980
Where's your face?

1570
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,180
Come and eat.

1571
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,580
I'm not hungry.

1572
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:43,380
You have to be a good girl.

1573
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,980
If you don't eat today,

1574
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,180
don't come to this table again.

1575
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,180
You're good at threatening people.

1576
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,780
I know you don't like chili and turnip.

1577
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,580
You like this.

1578
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,180
Eat.

1579
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,980
You look full.

1580
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,180
Eat.

1581
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,580
I made a lot this time.

1582
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:08,780
It's enough for you to eat one month every day.

1583
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,780
You said you like to eat this dried bean dumplings.

1584
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,180
Can you have the strength to go to work?

1585
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,780
You carry rice, you carry noodles, you carry the table.

1586
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,780
Why are you in a hurry? These are all yours.

1587
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,780
Don't give it to sister.

1588
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,780
You're so stingy.

1589
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,580
I want to eat fried pork with chili.

1590
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:37,980
Okay.

1591
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,380
Braised pork with chili.

1592
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,180
Okay.

1593
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,980
Fried pork with chili.

1594
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,380
I'll make it for you.

1595
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,180
Eat slowly.

1596
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,780
Eat fast and taste good.

1597
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,180
I treated you derelict, right?

1598
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,380
You treat me derelict, and I can't get along.

1599
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,780
Carrying you all in.

1600
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,780
Thank you so much, Ms.

1601
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,180
You've overreacted, and the bus stopped.

1602
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,980
Next time, we continue to repeat everything.

1603
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,380
Okay.

1604
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,980
Don't be careless with your diet.

1605
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:24,540
I know.

1606
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,540
I'm so hungry.

1607
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,740
My neck is stiff recently.

1608
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,100
I can't lift my head.

1609
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,980
You were on the floor and playing Douyin.

1610
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:31,780
You don't exercise at all.

1611
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,780
How can you not be stiff?

1612
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,380
I'll find Liu Jin to push you.

1613
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,260
I'm telling you.

1614
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,340
Hurry up and push me.

1615
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,340
Why are you so annoying?

1616
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,100
I'm annoying?

1617
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:39,500
I'm annoying?

1618
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,820
Don't let me treat you.

1619
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:41,420
Go, go, go.

1620
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:42,980
Doctor.

1621
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:43,940
Yi Yi.

1622
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,340
Yi Yi is here.

1623
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,540
Morning, Shun Jin.

1624
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,020
Morning.

1625
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,900
Come here.

1626
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:48,740
You're so heavy.

1627
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,660
You're like a little red.

1628
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:51,940
Dad didn't do it well.

1629
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,780
He said you didn't do it well.

1630
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,140
I did it well.

1631
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:55,860
He must have lost his hair.

1632
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,420
Liu Jin.

1633
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,500
The express delivery at my house

1634
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,220
has been deleted.

1635
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,340
I'll call your mom.

1636
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,180
I'll get it in two days.

1637
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,660
You haven't changed your clothes for days.

1638
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,060
It tastes stronger than powder.

1639
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,020
Do you smell it?

1640
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:06,860
It stinks.

1641
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:07,460
No.

1642
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:07,980
It stinks.

1643
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:08,700
No.

1644
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:11,740
Doctors.

1645
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,660
I'm a rich man.

1646
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,220
I'm 800 meters away from the community.

1647
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:14,780
Hurry up.

1648
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:15,740
I'm late.

1649
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,740
The internal inspection of the head of the city is very strict these two days.

1650
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,780
Have you packed up?

1651
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,340
I've packed up.

1652
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,340
Have you packed up?

1653
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,020
No.

1654
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:21,700
What about you?

1655
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,340
I forgot.

1656
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,260
Hurry up.

1657
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,260
I'm leaving.

1658
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:26,300
I wish you good luck.

1659
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:26,900
Are you done?

1660
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,300
You eat two bowls of noodles and give me ten thousand yuan.

1661
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,300
Are you fair?

1662
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:31,660
Hurry up.

1663
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:32,260
I'm late.

1664
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,020
Hurry up.

1665
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,020
Hurry up.

1666
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:34,580
Zhang Yitong.

1667
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:35,660
Bye.

1668
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:36,740
Bye.

1669
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:37,580
Bye.

1670
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,580
Bye.

1671
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:39,580
Bye.

1672
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,660
Be careful.

1673
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:41,660
Be careful.

1674
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:42,660
Bye.

1675
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:44,780
Here he comes.

1676
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,780
Here he comes.

1677
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,660
He's here.

1678
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,420
He's all my friends.

1679
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,980
I'm so happy.

1680
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,340
I'm so happy.

1681
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,340
I'm so happy.
