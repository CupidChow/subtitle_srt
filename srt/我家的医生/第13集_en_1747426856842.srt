00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,000
DIDO or POR burger?

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,760
nibble

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,600
I'm a generous person

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,320
wait a moment

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,880
So mean

so mean

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,280
It's not time to eat

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,620
I'm so generous

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,360

I'm not afraid of the world

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,240

00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,240

00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,240
I'm not afraid of the world

32
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,240
I'm not afraid of the world

33
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,240
I'm not afraid of the world

34
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,240

00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,240
I'm not afraid of the world

41
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Call a friend

42
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,240
Set a location and get it right away

43
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,240
Hurry up and run, tomorrow L is the new account

44
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,240
I secretly went from Zizhou to Meixi Lake

45
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,240
West Coast Manis

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,240
West Coast Manis

47
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
West Coast Manis

48
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,240
West Coast Manis

49
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
West Coast Manis

50
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,240
West Coast Manis

51
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,240
West Coast Manis

52
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,240
Lin Jianjun

53
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Lin Jianjun, you're the one who's wrong

54
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,240
President Lan, brother

55
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,240
Brother

56
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Zhao, why are you here?

57
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Zhao, you're here

58
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,240
Is my face the unreasonable person?

59
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Old mother and old father

60
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,240
I'm taking care of them

61
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,240
Wang Ruo, do you have any problem with me?

62
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,240
Doctor Zhao

63
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,240
You know what kind of character I am

64
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm such a character, will I lie to him?

65
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,240
And when dad left, I said

66
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,240
This house is left to me

67
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
My mom knows, you can ask her

68
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Ok, ok, I'll ask my grandma

69
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Zhao, you said this brother

70
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,240
What's so good about you two?

71
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
I don't have a brother, I don't have a brother

72
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
No, no, you guys talk

73
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Old mother and old mother, I don't care

74
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,240
House, house, want

75
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
There is no such cheap thing in the world

76
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
I don't care

77
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
I don't care

78
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm paying you every month

79
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
Every time I encounter such a thing, I kill people

80
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
I kill people

81
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,240
I kill people

82
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
What's the matter?

83
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
You talk about it

84
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Ok, ok

85
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
What are you doing?

86
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Give it back

87
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,240
You two, drink some water

88
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,240
What are you doing?

89
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Brother Wang, what are you doing?

90
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
I told you not to drink too much

91
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,240
Now another bottle of wine

92
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
I tell you, you are always so hard

93
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,240
You want to die in the short term, right?

94
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,240
No, no

95
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Brother Wang, you too

96
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,240
You didn't go to my place three days ago

97
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,240
I'll give you a test

98
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
You have a three-day period of birth pressure

99
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
The birth pressure is 140, the birth pressure is 90

100
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
You want to go to high school

101
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
You said it all the time

102
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
You two don't say anything

103
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,240
President Jiang is also angry

104
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,240
You are responsible

105
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
Brother, you are responsible

106
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
I'm fine, I'm fine

107
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
No, no, no, no

108
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
You said two sons are good

109
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Two sons are filial

110
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Right? You want to make him feel sorry

111
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Eat and read every day

112
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
President Jiang just called me

113
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
I thought something was wrong

114
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
I'm afraid you have something to do

115
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
I didn't change my clothes and came here in a hurry

116
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Good thing, right?

117
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,240
The money is all for the reward

118
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
How many hours are left?

119
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Anyway, it's all good

120
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Right? You can discuss it when you go back

121
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Right? It's up to you

122
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
I'm not going to steal a house

123
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
I said you two

124
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Just sign this contract

125
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Can you?

126
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Say something

127
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Sign, sign

128
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Isn't that enough?

129
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Did Dr. Zhao eat?

130
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Eat sister

131
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
What are you doing?

132
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Don't be angry, I'm going back to the hospital

133
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Dr. Zhao is off work

134
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Not yet, work overtime tonight

135
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Take a walk

136
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Right, take a walk

137
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Good

138
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Have you eaten?

139
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
Not yet

140
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
How many rounds have you played?

141
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
Yes, your little master hasn't finished work yet

142
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Not yet, wait for him to eat together

143
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Yes, you guys play slowly

144
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,240
You didn't see it today, did you?

145
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Uncle Fang also gave me two oranges

146
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,240
And those two aunties who hit the mountain

147
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
I was so coaxed

148
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
A reconciliation

149
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,240
I've made great progress recently

150
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
I'm very familiar with this area

151
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
But

152
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
I believe you may be a little worse

153
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
But I will work hard

154
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Don't worry, when the time comes

155
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Aren't you going home?

156
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Bye bye

157
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Mom

158
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
Why are you out?

159
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,240
You're asking weird questions

160
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
I can't even go out

161
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
No, the doctor said you can go out

162
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
But you have to let people help you

163
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Let's go home first, I'll go out with you after dinner

164
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Zhao Dongcheng's brother has a girlfriend?

165
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
How do I know?

166
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,240
I saw you guys came back together

167
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
That boy is quite active

168
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
There must be a lot of little girls in the hospital

169
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
Like him

170
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
I don't know

171
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
You're his leader

172
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Zhao Dongcheng grew up with you

173
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
You guys are together often

174
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
You should care about it

175
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Surprise

176
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Director, auntie

177
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
I'm coming

178
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
She likes you

179
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,240
I'm a good leader

180
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
You're still pretending here

181
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
You said you were under the cover

182
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
How dare you

183
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,240
If she really likes me

184
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,640
What can I do?

185
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,120
Listen,

186
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,320
don't be fooled by

187
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,120
this young man.

188
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,280
You two are not suitable for each other.

189
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,000
Do you hear me?

190
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,360
You're old,

191
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
but he's still young.

192
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,480
If he changes his mind,

193
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,040
what will you do?

194
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,160
You...

195
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,640
You're with Zhao Dongcheng's brother.

196
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,520
The neighbors all know you.

197
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,920
What will they think of you?

198
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,360
I don't care.

199
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,920
Who will be ashamed of you?

200
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,240
I'm talking to you.

201
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,720
Why can't you hear me?

202
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,200
155.

203
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,600
3143.

204
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,800
Hello?

205
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,880
Hello, mom.

206
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,040
Hello, mom.

207
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,200
Come here.

208
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Wait a minute, baby.

209
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,640
Call your mom.

210
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,200
Yi Yi, do you have a brother?

211
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,680
Hello?

212
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,440
Mom.

213
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,120
Yi Yi, did you make a wrong call?

214
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,240
Yi Yi,

215
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,360
is he really your mom?

216
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,200
Why does anyone

217
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,840
call your mom?

218
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,160
Hello?

219
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,000
Why don't you answer?

220
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,560
Who is it?

221
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,440
Hello?

222
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,320
Can you hear me?

223
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,040
Hello, Auntie Liu.

224
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,120
What's wrong?

225
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,480
Doctor Yu,

226
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,400
do you know the daughter of Dr. Zhang Jun?

227
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,760
Zhang Yi Yi?

228
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,360
She's in my shop now.

229
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Why is she there?

230
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,320
I saw her walking on the road,

231
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,120
crying and crying.

232
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,200
So I stopped her.

233
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Don't worry.

234
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,640
Yi Yi,

235
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,520
do you want to talk to Dr. Yu?

236
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,520
Yi Yi,

237
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,680
what's wrong?

238
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,240
Sister Yuxuan,

239
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,920
don't kill dad.

240
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,880
Or I'll be too old.

241
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,680
Can you come back to me?

242
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,240
Okay, okay.

243
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,600
I'll go to you.

244
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,160
Don't cry, okay?

245
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,600
Don't tell Yi Yi

246
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,800
that Dr. Liu is here.

247
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
I'll be too embarrassed.

248
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay, okay.

249
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
I won't tell them.

250
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,280
Wait for me there.

251
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,880
I'll go to you now.

252
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,320
Don't cry.

253
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,000
Be good.

254
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,520
What's wrong?

255
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,560
Can you tell me?

256
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,040
I don't know.

257
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,240
He won't let me tell you.

258
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,160
I'll go to him first.

259
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,440
Be careful.

260
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
I'll send a message to Jun.

261
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,120
Okay.

262
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:55,960
Okay.

263
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,600
I'll send a message to him.

264
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,200
Okay, okay.

265
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,640
Bye.

266
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,040
Bye.

267
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,520
Bye.

268
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,960
Jun, don't be anxious.

269
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,440
We're all anxious.

270
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Yi Yi won't let us know

271
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,640
about these things,

272
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,440
especially you.

273
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,200
He's in Aunt Liu's place

274
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,960
and he's safe.

275
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,120
So I just sent a message to Liu Jing

276
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
and told him to go there

277
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,760
to meet Yi Yi.

278
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,280
Yes.

279
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,720
Yes.

280
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,440
You didn't come just now.

281
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,560
And I was talking to Liu Jing.

282
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,320
Is it possible that Yi Yi

283
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,640
can't see his mom?

284
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,440
Is there something

285
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,360
going on between you guys

286
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,280
that you can't solve?

287
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,040
Yes.

288
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,600
Right.

289
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,200
Yes.

290
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,480
to go out of this community.

291
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
If you don't solve it,

292
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,920
we won't be able to control it one day.

293
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,880
That's right, Jun.

294
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,200
I've asked you many times before.

295
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,000
You didn't tell me

296
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,760
what happened.

297
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
Hello, Xi Xi's mother.

298
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,440
Can you tell me that Yi Yi...

299
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay, okay, okay.

300
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm not in a hurry.

301
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm not in a hurry.

302
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,160
Did Xi Xi tell you

303
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,120
why Yi Yi did that?

304
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,160
My father lied to me.

305
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,160
How did he lie to you?

306
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,320
He lied to me.

307
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,560
My mother is a student.

308
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,400
She's doing research abroad.

309
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,480
So she didn't come back.

310
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,600
But I called my mother.

311
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,840
There are other kids

312
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,560
who call me mother.

313
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,480
She has another kid.

314
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,720
She doesn't want me anymore.

315
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,560
She doesn't want my father either.

316
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,600
She's always been like that.

317
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,200
We're already married.

318
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,640
That's why she didn't come to see me.

319
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,520
She won't come to see me again.

320
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,480
Okay, okay.

321
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,320
Don't cry, okay?

322
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,640
Don't cry.

323
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,680
Think about it first.

324
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,200
Because now,

325
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,960
you're thinking too much.

326
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,440
You haven't asked your father, right?

327
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,800
Go ask him first.

328
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,320
What do you think?

329
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,120
Why are you here?

330
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Yi Yi said I can't tell them.

331
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,160
Who said I can't tell them?

332
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,080
Right?

333
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Yi Yi, drink some coke.

334
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,880
My father won't let me drink.

335
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,600
Aren't you angry with your father?

336
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,120
Why are you still listening to him?

337
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,760
I want to drink anyway.

338
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,160
I want to drink too.

339
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,120
I want to drink too.

340
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,960
Here.

341
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,320
Is it good?

342
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,720
So, Yi Yi,

343
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,760
you should ask your father first.

344
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,600
See how he answers you.

345
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,920
It's okay if you can't understand it now.

346
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,000
You'll understand it when you grow up.

347
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,320
What if I get angry at him when I grow up?

348
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,600
Then be angry.

349
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,680
Although I don't think you should leave home,

350
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,920
you should have the right to be angry.

351
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,880
Remember,

352
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,280
whether you should be happy or angry

353
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,120
is your right.

354
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,760
Let's go home now.

355
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,520
Your father has to take responsibility for your father's law.

356
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,080
If you leave home now,

357
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,040
it'll be too easy for him.

358
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,640
Right.

359
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,880
But I don't want to go home now.

360
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
What about you?

361
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,720
I want to go to the river.

362
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,520
Okay, let's go to the river.

363
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,400
Bye.

364
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,120
Let's go.

365
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,560
If my parents

366
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,640
can be like you,

367
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll be fine.

368
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,400
Yi Zhi.

369
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,960
Yi Zhi,

370
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,800
when do you ankle up and back?

371
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,720
What do you mean?

372
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,840
S Rs.

373
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,680
The small gifts

374
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,680
are for you.

375
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,840
Right, this is...

376
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,720
My sister,

377
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,000
your sister.

378
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't know how to explain it to her.

379
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,280
I told her

380
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,600
that my mom went on a business trip.

381
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,160
She went abroad for business trips.

382
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,400
And

383
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,120
she might not be back for a long time.

384
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,600
Brother Jun,

385
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,520
what do you mean by

386
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,640
leaving?

387
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,960
Su Yue is sick.

388
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,600
I thought

389
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,400
we tried all means to keep her.

390
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,440
But she...

391
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,920
So you kept Yiyi

392
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,000
and all of us in secret.

393
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,600
I...

394
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,520
I really can't bear to tell this lie.

395
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,320
And

396
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,600
the reason why I didn't tell you

397
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
is because I

398
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,640
don't know how to tell you.

399
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,480
I don't know how to tell you.

400
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,880
And I think it's my own business.

401
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,600
I can handle it.

402
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,320
I can also

403
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,800
treat Yiyi well.

404
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,720
I can definitely do it.

405
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,120
That's it.

406
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,020
Yiyi.

407
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,680
Dad.

408
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Can we go home?

409
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,200
Come on.

410
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,000
Let me take her home.

411
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,360
Sorry.

412
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,680
I'll take him back first.

413
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,640
Say goodbye to Uncle Lin.

414
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,000
Goodbye.

415
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,120
Goodbye.

416
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,360
Bye-bye.

417
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,880
It's really not easy for Jun.

418
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,280
Did Yi Yi treat her aunt

419
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,280
as her mother

420
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,520
on the phone?

421
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,800
Because Yi Yi always

422
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,880
quarrels with her mom at home.

423
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,880
She always asks me,

424
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,720
she says,

425
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,320
Dad,

426
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,880
why isn't Mom back yet?

427
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,320
When will Mom come back?

428
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
She doesn't miss Yi Yi.

429
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,240
I don't know how to answer these questions.

430
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,760
Then every time we call,

431
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,720
as long as we think about it,

432
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,080
Yi Yi is always the first one

433
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,720
to run over and answer the phone.

434
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,600
Because she thought

435
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,320
Mom would call back.

436
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,040
One day,

437
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,120
Su Yue's sister called.

438
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,600
She thought it was Mom.

439
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,960
Then she called on the phone.

440
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,160
She said,

441
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,440
Mom,

442
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,000
Jun thought she couldn't keep it from him.

443
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
She told him,

444
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,440
Su Yue is doing science abroad.

445
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,440
She can't come back.

446
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,000
She kept hiding it from Yi Yi.

447
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,480
No wonder Yi Yi

448
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,560
always calls Su Yue.

449
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,960
And we really

450
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,440
haven't seen Su Yue.

451
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,200
Why didn't we think of this?

452
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,200
I understand Jun.

453
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,440
Yi Yi is quite sensible.

454
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,920
Let's not underestimate our friends.

455
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,840
Do you think Jun

456
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,880
will tell Yi Yi this time?

457
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,080
Maybe the one who needs this lie

458
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,160
is not only you.

459
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,400
The police officer

460
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,640
is really not us.

461
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,280
He bullied us.

462
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,040
He wanted to

463
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,320
take over the old man's legacy.

464
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,840
Do you know?

465
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,880
Yes, the police officer.

466
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,720
Listen to me.

467
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
This little girl

468
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,120
is so kind.

469
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,200
She's so kind.

470
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,600
Now she even closed the door.

471
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,760
We don't have any photos

472
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,960
of the old man.

473
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,360
You said she had no conscience.

474
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,600
When she was young, we...

475
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,320
What?

476
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,000
She needs to remember.

477
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,600
Can she be like this now?

478
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,120
She lives in our house.

479
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,000
I forgot about you.

480
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,760
She's totally a white man.

481
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,640
What?

482
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,840
You're so rude.

483
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,800
The police is here.

484
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,640
Open the door.

485
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,720
When we were young,

486
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,800
we didn't care about her mother.

487
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,360
What's wrong with us?

488
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,440
Why are you so rude?

489
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,880
She didn't even open the door.

490
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
What the hell?

491
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,880
Open the door.

492
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
The police is here.

493
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,040
Why are you so rude?

494
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,840
You can't enter the house

495
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,720
of the old woman.

496
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,600
You're so mean.

497
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,880
You're so rude to your old woman.

498
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,480
You're so mean.

499
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,280
Come on.

500
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
I need to take a break.

501
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,960
You're right.

502
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,720
You're right.

503
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,880
I'm fine.

504
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm fine.

505
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:38,960
I'm fine.

506
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,640
We'll know

507
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,240
when we get to the city.

508
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
But you're so rude.

509
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,080
Your blood pressure is high.

510
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,280
Your blood pressure is high.

511
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,280
You haven't had a good rest recently, right?

512
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
I'm fine.

513
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,880
I've checked.

514
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,680
I'm fine.

515
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,280
Maybe

516
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,240
your uncle and aunt

517
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,680
will go up

518
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,040
if you're in a bad mood.

519
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
I'll take you to the hospital tomorrow

520
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,000
to have a pre-test.

521
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
No need.

522
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Just listen to the doctor.

523
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,120
When they come again,

524
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,440
call me as soon as possible.

525
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
Okay?

526
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Do you have any uncomfortable things

527
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
lately?

528
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Do you have

529
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,480
a pustule on your body

530
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,840
or a heart attack?

531
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,960
A pustule on your body

532
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,240
or a heart attack?

533
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,240
A headache?

534
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
None of them?

535
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,440
I feel much better now.

536
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Really.

537
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,280
Then you should rest early today.

538
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,200
Okay?

539
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,960
I'll bring you something to eat tomorrow.

540
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,080
Then I'll take you to the hospital

541
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
to have a pre-test.

542
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Okay?

543
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,920
Okay.

544
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Just listen to the doctor.

545
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,520
I'll go back first.

546
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,480
You should go to bed early today.

547
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Okay?

548
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Okay.

549
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Deng Cheng.

550
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,360
Can you stay here tonight?

551
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,540
You can go.

552
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,380
Keep it.

553
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,580
Good night.

554
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,100
Good night.

555
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,660
Good night.

556
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,700
Good night.

557
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,620
You're fated to die

558
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,980
this morning.

559
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,940
It's him.

560
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,340
You should rest today.

561
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,340
You should go out.

562
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,540
There's a system competition.

563
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,340
I'm leaving.

564
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,140
Zhao Dongcheng's brother?

565
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,740
He's resting today, too.

566
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,740
He's not going.

567
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,940
I'm alone.

568
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,340
You're going to a competition like this.

569
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,540
What can you do

570
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,540
if you win the first place?

571
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,740
Can you get a bonus?

572
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,940
Can you get a salary?

573
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,940
What are you thinking about?

574
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,140
Don't come back today.

575
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,140
Xiao Han is resting today, too.

576
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,140
You look pretty in this dress today.

577
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,340
Go and ask him out.

578
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,740
I'm going.

579
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,340
Did you hear that?

580
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,540
This...

581
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,740
Don't forget.

582
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,340
Go and ask Xiao Han out.

583
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,940
Please forgive me.

584
00:23:38,980 --> 00:24:03,240
Take a photo of yourself.

585
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,140
One.

586
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,540
Two.

587
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,740
Three.

588
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,900
Four.

589
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,500
Five.

590
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,420
Six.

591
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,700
One.

592
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,220
Two.

593
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,220
Three.

594
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,860
Who taught you this game?

595
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,820
Grandpa Shi.

596
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,420
Grandpa Shi?

597
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,420
Yi Yi.

598
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,700
Do you like Grandpa Shi?

599
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,820
Of course.

600
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,020
When I was in the supermarket,

601
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,900
whenever Grandpa Shi was around,

602
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,660
he would buy me food.

603
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,380
Yi Yi.

604
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,340
When you see Grandpa Shi

605
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,100
lying there,

606
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,780
will you be afraid?

607
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,420
Dad,

608
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,580
didn't you teach me that?

609
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,140
You should say goodbye

610
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,260
to the person you love.

611
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,940
Every time I see Grandpa Shi,

612
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,060
I'll say

613
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,260
goodbye to him.

614
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,980
Left.

615
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,580
Left.

616
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,380
Right.

617
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,860
Right.

618
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,740
I want to tell you something.

619
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,420
Go ahead.

620
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,180
Go.

621
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,380
If mom leaves us,

622
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,540
like Grandpa Shi,

623
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,260
he'll leave us forever.

624
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,180
And then,

625
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,500
every morning,

626
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,100
dad will wake you up.

627
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,620
Dad will dress you.

628
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,980
Dad will send you to school.

629
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
And every time you

630
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,300
have a sports day,

631
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,660
graduation ceremony,

632
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,940
and birthday,

633
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,580
dad will be there for you.

634
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,100
Will you be unhappy?

635
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,340
Dad.

636
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,540
Actually, I haven't

637
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,620
seen mom for a long time.

638
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,740
I almost forget

639
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,860
what mom looks like.

640
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,540
I haven't seen mom for a long time, either.

641
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,140
I almost forget

642
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,460
what she looks like.

643
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,260
Do you miss mom?

644
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,700
Yes.

645
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,860
How about you?

646
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,220
Okay.

647
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,860
Do you miss mom?

648
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,920
Oh my god.

649
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,740
Dad.

650
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,340
What's wrong with you?

651
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:37,540
I'm also worried that Yi Yi won't like the clothes I choose.

652
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,340
And when I see a lot of kids going to the party together,

653
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,640
they have their parents to accompany them. But Yi Yi is alone.

654
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,240
Dad is worried that he can't do a lot of things well.

655
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,940
Is Dad very bad, Yi Yi?

656
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,540
Dad, you're already very good. You're not bad at all.

657
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,540
Yi Yi won't be unhappy because of you.

658
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,340
Dad, you're Yi Yi's big hero.

659
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,940
Yi Yi,

660
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,940
can you hug me?

661
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,580
Our daughter is Hola Нет.

662
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,740
Growth is like a hand between does and it never ends.

663
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:41,140
We exchange the courage to grow old with a simple pencil and the 올� grim очalog.

664
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,540
It seemed to have happened in that moment.

665
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,740
Why did you bring me here?

666
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,380
You'll know when you get there.

667
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,220
I have to go home and have dinner with my mom.

668
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,420
Come on.

669
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,340
Be careful.

670
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:54,900
Youli.

671
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,540
Be careful.

672
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,860
This room?

673
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,420
Yes.

674
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,580
Look.

675
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,100
Come on.

676
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,220
Oh, my god.

677
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,260
Look.

678
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,060
It's so big.

679
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,940
Congratulations.

680
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,660
Congratulations.

681
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,860
The fish master won the first place in the public knowledge competition.

682
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:18,980
How is it?

683
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,620
Is it a surprise?

684
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,500
Is it unexpected?

685
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,940
I don't know what to say.

686
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,220
Don't just stand there.

687
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,780
I've prepared a lot of food.

688
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,180
Not only food,

689
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,140
but also cakes.

690
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,820
Except for cakes,

691
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,140
there are also red packets of congratulations.

692
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,820
And red packets.

693
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,220
I'll sing you a song.

694
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,580
The red packet of congratulations

695
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,740
is taking me to the river.

696
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,500
Aunt.

697
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,900
Have you ever had a headache after taking this medicine?

698
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,300
I'm sorry, I didn't do anything wrong.

699
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,340
The inventory of the test 플� doctors said I was fine.

700
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,380
Don't worry.

701
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,020
Rest according to doctor.

702
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,260
Okay, listen to the doctor.

703
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
Okay.

704
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,700
You must be tired after staying with me for a day.

705
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,700
No.

706
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,940
A Yan.

707
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
Zhao Zong Cheng.

708
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,780
What's wrong?

709
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,580
You've made it clear to me.

710
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,540
What's going on with the fish market?

711
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,020
Why did you go to the mystery department?

712
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,380
Don't say you don't know.

713
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,220
You guys are just watching the fish market.

714
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,380
They're all listening to you.

715
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,860
They won't hide anything from you.

716
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,780
Three years ago,

717
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,500
the fish market fell down in the night shift.

718
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,580
It was a sudden stroke.

719
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,900
Fortunately, it fell in the hospital.

720
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,740
The person was saved.

721
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,420
Then he said,

722
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,940
the first thought was that he could finally rest.

723
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,340
The second thought was

724
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,060
that he couldn't be hospitalized to pay for his fees

725
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,540
and get the procedures done.

726
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,940
So he only notified me.

727
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,780
So he resigned because...

728
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,100
He's doing well now.

729
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,100
You can go back to the hospital you used to go to.

730
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,460
Or go to another hospital.

731
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,460
But don't stay in this community hospital.

732
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,860
I won't resign.

733
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,980
I'm very satisfied with my job now.

734
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,820
If you really want to die for him,

735
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,100
you have to listen to his idea.

736
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,100
His idea.

737
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,420
He's better than you think.

738
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,820
We eat.

739
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,180
You only have to appreciate the living.

740
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,180
That's right.

741
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,940
Mom, why did you just answer the phone?

742
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,740
I'm not coming back.

743
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,260
Jianjian suddenly coughed.

744
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,340
I'll come back when she's better.

745
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,540
Mom, why aren't you talking?

746
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,540
You're not feeling well again.

747
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,940
How did Shi take care of you?

748
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,540
You were just falling down at home.

749
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,940
I haven't scolded him yet.

750
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,740
He should stay home for a few more days

751
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,340
when he knows you're not feeling well.

752
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,940
Can't he care about you a little bit?

753
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,740
Does he really know what he's doing at home?

754
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,540
He's like a debtor to others every day.

755
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,340
If you think he's not taking good care of you,

756
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,740
then come back by yourself.

757
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,740
Mom.

758
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,540
There's something going on in the company.

759
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,540
The kids are sick.

760
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,940
You always have a reason.

761
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,940
When I'm sick,

762
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,140
when I need to go to the hospital,

763
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,540
when I need someone to take care of me,

764
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,540
all the people who are with me

765
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,740
are your sister.

766
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,740
Where are you?

767
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,340
You can ask for leave if you want.

768
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,940
She has a job too.

769
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,540
I fell down.

770
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,340
I fell down because of my own business.

771
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,140
What does it have to do with your sister?

772
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,340
Taking care of an old man

773
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,740
is so difficult.

774
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,140
Is it that easy?

775
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,340
He knew you were back.

776
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,540
He woke you up that night.

777
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,340
He even tidied up his room for you.

778
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,540
How can you say that to him?

779
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,340
What's wrong with Yu Shi?

780
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,140
Mom.

781
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,740
How can you say that to him in front of me?

782
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,340
He's also my daughter.

783
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,540
You're a good daughter.

784
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,740
You're a good daughter.

785
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,340
Auntie Tan, you're just a little bit capable.

786
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,940
Auntie, how can you say that to Director Yu?

787
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,340
He's very, very, very important to our hospital.

788
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,540
I feel like they're all relying on you.

789
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,540
They seem to want to tell you everything.

790
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,140
We grew up together.

791
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,540
I'm their family's external agent.

792
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,340
I can't do anything about it.

793
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,940
Have you ever thought about leaving here?

794
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,340
I'm not saying this is bad.

795
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,940
I'm just saying...

796
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,140
I'm saying you've been staying here all this time

797
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,540
but you never thought about going somewhere else.

798
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,940
Where?

799
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,940
I'm just saying.

800
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,940
I've been thinking...

801
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,540
that my brother isn't here anymore.

802
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,740
Whether I stay here or not

803
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,140
doesn't matter to me.

804
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,940
You're all...

805
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,940
You're all my family.

806
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,140
You're all my family.

807
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,740
You're leaving the hospital?

808
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,140
I'm just saying. Don't take it to heart.

809
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,340
What if my other aunt texts me into this?

810
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,740
Yes?

811
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,540
Uncle Li?

812
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,940
She probably isn't going to...

813
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Okay.

814
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,740
All right.

815
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,940
10 more minutes, okay?

816
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,220
I'm going to the hospital.

817
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,460
You're going out?

818
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,300
A patient just had the surgery.

819
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,020
He's a little bleeding. I'll go take a look.

820
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,860
Come back soon.

821
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,100
I'm back.

822
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,060
Mom.

823
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,300
Mom.

824
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,420
You're home.

825
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,620
Where's Dr. Wei Bokang?

826
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,300
I was lying down with him.

827
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,620
Have you eaten?

828
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
Have you eaten?

829
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,300
I have.

830
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,300
You went with Zhao Dongcheng and the others?

831
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,300
From now on,

832
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,780
don't eat outside.

833
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,020
Go home and eat.

834
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,580
I know.

835
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,220
What's wrong?

836
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,660
chores

837
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,700
Is this end earnest?

838
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,540
Yes.

839
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,640
Matt looking

840
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,000
I am here

841
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:23,940
Come,

842
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,520
on CEO Zhou

843
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,020
what

844
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,980
I have my own friend, too.

845
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,020
Then she's also a private.

846
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,460
Wait a minute.

847
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,420
I'll be right there.

848
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:34,700
I'll be right there.

849
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,380
Thank you.

850
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,100
I saw Sister Chun.

851
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,540
I suddenly feel that she looks familiar.

852
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,580
Was it this one that we asked for?

853
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,580
Is this one too romantic for you?

854
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,180
Yes.

855
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,740
I remember it's this one.

856
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,540
Right?

857
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,740
Yes, it's this one.

858
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,180
At that time,

859
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,980
Gao Shan's last self-study class,

860
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,380
you told me that

861
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,820
when the college entrance examination is over,

862
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,220
we'll come to collect the powder.

863
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,060
I've been remembering it.

864
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,900
Who told me to remember what I learned?

865
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,060
I can't remember anything.

866
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,820
But I remember this very clearly.

867
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,860
It's okay.

868
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,380
After eating the powder,

869
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,100
it's okay.

870
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,260
Don't look at me like that.

871
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,380
This is my own business.

872
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,180
After seeing you like this,

873
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,060
I feel embarrassed.

874
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,740
It's all in the past.

875
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,540
Wei Ji.

876
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,180
Actually, I've been thinking for a long time.

877
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,780
I think maybe you should have heard

878
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,420
something from your colleague.

879
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,300
I think there are some things

880
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,860
that I still have to tell you clearly.

881
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,020
I went abroad after graduation from college.

882
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,140
I married my current husband,

883
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,980
who was my boyfriend at that time.

884
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,820
I got pregnant and had a baby

885
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,540
before I got married.

886
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,620
Then his investment failed.

887
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,100
We went back to China together.

888
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,980
I thought

889
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,020
we should start over

890
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,820
and find a more stable job.

891
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,220
But maybe it's true that

892
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:25,700
I've been

893
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,060
on the edge of being a Chinese for too long.

894
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,500
I haven't found a job

895
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,940
that I'm satisfied with for a long time.

896
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,980
Look, isn't this

897
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,780
a safe-purchase now?

898
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,420
That day, I indeed saw your name

899
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,940
on the medical list.

900
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,780
So I pretended to be hesitant with you.

901
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,340
Actually, it's...

902
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,220
Anyway, I just want to say

903
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,780
maybe I'm different from

904
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,060
the Guo Ting I met back then

905
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,500
and the Guo Ting you imagined.

906
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,780
Those things have passed.

907
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,620
I'm sorry.

908
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,140
Liu Jin, I'm really sorry.

909
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,020
My husband suddenly has a meeting.

910
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,540
I was supposed to ask him to pick up the baby,

911
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,820
but I might have to rush over now.

912
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,180
How about I ask you to do it

913
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,660
another day?

914
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,980
It's okay.

915
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,020
Go ahead.

916
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,420
I can eat this alone.

917
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,580
I'm really sorry

918
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,980
for putting you on the spot every time.

919
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,140
Then I'll go first.

920
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,620
Guo Ting.

921
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,300
Actually, in my heart,

922
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,700
you're nothing different from before.

923
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,500
Thank you, Liu Jin.

924
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,820
Well...

925
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,900
Goodbye, Guo Ting.

926
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,540
Goodbye.

927
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,820
The door is open.

928
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,500
Xu Tianxia, open the door.

929
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,420
Xu Tianxia, I'm watching you.

930
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,340
Open the door.

931
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,500
Come out.

932
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,820
Don't scare me with the big lights.

933
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,460
I'm telling you.

934
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,540
We're not scared by the big lights.

935
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,460
I'm telling you.

936
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,660
The police are looking for us.

937
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,500
You're a liar.

938
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,260
Go in.

939
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:53,700
Open the door.

940
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,500
Did you hear that?

941
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,740
You scared me.

942
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,940
It's okay.

943
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,380
Come on.

944
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,380
Let's take a look inside.

945
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,580
Let's see who Xu Tianxia is.

946
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,420
You're so mean to her.

947
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,260
You're my aunt.

948
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,020
Look at me.

949
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:04,900
Come out.

950
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,100
Open the door.

951
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:06,780
He's my husband.

952
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,260
It's not him.

953
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,820
Don't think you're fine if you don't open the door.

954
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,900
This yellow one is being demolished.

955
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,340
The hospital

956
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,700
has a unified plan.

957
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,340
Yes, it's a unified plan.

958
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,340
But we...

959
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,420
We just found out.

960
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,940
You're not going to stay in the valley.

961
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,580
He...

962
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,020
He knew about this.

963
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,580
So he went in

964
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,780
and lied to my husband.

965
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:24,980
Open the door.

966
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:25,740
Open the door.

967
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,380
This yellow one is being demolished.

968
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,380
Don't think you're fine if you don't open the door.

969
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,140
He's singing.

970
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,620
Look at this white man.

971
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,980
Let's take a look inside.

972
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,940
Who is he?

973
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,020
He's singing.

974
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,140
We don't want to be like this.

975
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,780
He's being too rude.

976
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,820
He's singing.

977
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,940
It's not like that.

978
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,620
Xu Tianxia.

979
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:41,780
Come here.

980
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,380
You Tong, open the door.

981
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,060
I'll go.

982
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,100
Why are you here?

983
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:57,900
I...

984
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,020
Did you hear something?

985
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,100
The noodles are here.

986
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,020
The noodles are here.

987
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,740
Sir.

988
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,340
Here.

989
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,300
The noodles.

990
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:14,620
Sister, I...

991
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,460
You also want noodles?

992
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,060
I've never seen you before.

993
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,380
Where are the noodles?

994
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,020
Where are the noodles?

995
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,740
Here they are.

996
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,620
I didn't hear anything.

997
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,060
I'm here to deliver the noodles.

998
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:35,900
How about

999
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,820
I eat with you?

1000
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,100
Sit down.

1001
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,540
Thanks, boss.

1002
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,460
Did you break up?

1003
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:17,780
I didn't hear that he was here to make noodles

1004
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,180
The sweet beef noodles of Sister Chun's house

1005
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,060
It's always so spicy

1006
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,820
Half of a tablespoons

1007
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,800
Hemorrhagic

1008
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,620
You already cried

1009
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,940
You'd rather say you lose your face

1010
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,660
I didn't cry

1011
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,480
I'm just

1012
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,100
Hot

1013
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,180
I really didn't cry

1014
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,660
Sit

1015
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,780
I didn't cry.

1016
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,500
I...

1017
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,700
I didn't cry.

1018
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,300
It's not a heartbreak.

1019
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,980
I just said goodbye and recalled my youth.

1020
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:25,780
I was looking...

1021
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,420
I wasn't looking at the future.

1022
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,980
I just said goodbye and recalled my past.

1023
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,180
You...

1024
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,140
You...

1025
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,540
Why are you laughing?

1026
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,700
Of course I'm laughing.

1027
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,860
You've said goodbye.

1028
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,460
Then, I have a chance.

1029
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,940
I thought you said it's spicy.

1030
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,220
It's really a little spicy.

1031
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,580
Yeah, right?

1032
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,220
I'm here.

1033
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,780
I'm here.

1034
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,360
What are you cooking?

1035
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,500
It smells so good.

1036
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:32,940
clay ear soup.

1037
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:36,540
It's done.

1038
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,100
Come on.

1039
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,020
Please.

1040
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,620
Are you with Guan Xu today?

1041
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,700
I Lucky that I got to meet him.

1042
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,780
Why don't we carousel around you now?

1043
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,500
You look like your heart's about to break.

1044
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,900
When you're sentimental,

1045
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,500
you'll be the one who's passive.

1046
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,660
A young man'll be moved by the expressive circumstances

1047
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,660
Don't give yourself up.

1048
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,660
One day, if she wants to break up,

1049
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,660
she can break up.

1050
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,660
You won't have too much loss.

1051
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,660
Understand?

1052
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,660
You are really stimulated by something.

1053
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,660
I'm also very contradictory.

1054
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,660
I don't want you to go the wrong way.

1055
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,660
I don't want you to be influenced by me.

1056
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,660
Just don't be like me.

1057
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,660
I don't want you to be like me.

1058
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,660
Tang Hong.

1059
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,660
What's wrong with you?

1060
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,660
I think you are pretty good.

1061
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,660
My daughter is also pretty good.

1062
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,660
Are you sure you are okay?

1063
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,660
What?

1064
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,660
You can't blame me for being okay?

1065
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,660
No, no, no.

1066
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,660
It's okay.

1067
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,660
You said you were going to fight.

1068
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,660
It's delicious.

1069
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,660
How can it be so delicious?

1070
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,660
I'm sorry.

1071
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,660
What's wrong with you?

1072
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,660
Tang Hong just came again.

1073
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,660
I don't want to see you again.

1074
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,660
I'm sorry.

1075
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,660
I'm sorry.

1076
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,660
I'm sorry.

1077
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,660
I'm sorry.

1078
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,660
I'm sorry.

1079
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,660
I don't want to stay here anymore.

1080
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,660
I really can't stay here anymore.

1081
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,660
I want to go.

1082
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,660
Okay.

1083
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,660
You can change the environment and adjust your mood.

1084
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,660
It's okay.

1085
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,660
You can go with me, okay?

1086
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,660
Let's go together.

1087
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,660
Just the two of us.

1088
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,660
I can't leave you behind.

1089
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,660
Calm down.

1090
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:29,660
I'm not going to leave you behind.

1091
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,660
I'm not going to leave you behind.

1092
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,660
Can we talk about it again?

1093
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,660
Why can't I go?

1094
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,660
Why do I have to stay here?

1095
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,660
I know you've been living here since you were a child.

1096
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,660
But this community is going to be demolished.

1097
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,660
There's no more music.

1098
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,660
What's there to miss?

1099
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,660
Why are you staying here?

1100
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,660
All the people you know are leaving.

1101
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,660
This place is going to be gone.

1102
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,660
For your illness,

1103
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,660
they're going to have a better, better, bigger hospital.

1104
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,660
They don't need you.

1105
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,660
Your family, your friends,

1106
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:35,660
they all have their own lives.

1107
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,660
They all have their own space.

1108
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,660
They don't need you.

1109
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,660
Come with me.

1110
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,660
I'll give you a hand.

1111
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,660
You have to use it well.

1112
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,660
Don't be lazy.

1113
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,660
I'll check it next time.

1114
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,660
Okay, okay, okay.

1115
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,660
After I go back,

1116
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,660
I'll do it the way you said.

1117
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,660
Okay.

1118
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,660
Here.

1119
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,660
Take care.

1120
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,660
Okay.

1121
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,660
Keep your clothes and face warm.

1122
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:14,660
Don't catch a cold.

1123
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,660
Okay.

1124
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,660
Thank you.

1125
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,660
Bye.

1126
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,660
Bye.

1127
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,660
Bye.

1128
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,660
Bye.

1129
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,660
Bye.

1130
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,660
Bye.

1131
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,660
Bye.

1132
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,660
Bye.

1133
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,660
Bye.

1134
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,660
Bye.

1135
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,660
Bye.

1136
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,660
Bye.

1137
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,660
Don't catch a cold.

1138
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,660
I don't want to leave you.

1139
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,660
I don't want to leave you.

1140
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:34,660
Auntie,

1141
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,660
we're doing this for the overall plan.

1142
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,660
Where are we going to apply for a hospital?

1143
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,660
After we disband,

1144
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,660
we'll change it.

1145
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,660
There will be a better,

1146
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,660
newer design plan.

1147
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,660
How can a hospital be built by saying goodbye?

1148
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,660
Auntie,

1149
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,660
we're not leaving just like that.

1150
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,660
We'll leave when we're almost done.

1151
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,660
Don't worry.

1152
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,660
Yes.

1153
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,660
We won't disband.

1154
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,660
I'll apply for a hospital.

1155
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,660
Where will my grandson go for the vaccine?

1156
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,660
Auntie, don't worry.

1157
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,660
You're from Mingjue Home, right?

1158
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,660
Yes.

1159
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,660
You'll go to this hospital from now on.

1160
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,660
It's quite close to you.

1161
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,660
Yes.

1162
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,660
You can go to this one.

1163
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:08,660
It's not far from here.

1164
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,660
Let me see.

1165
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,660
It's not far from here.

1166
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,660
I think it's convenient here.

1167
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:15,660
Yes.

1168
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,660
We're used to it here.

1169
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,660
Indeed.

1170
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,660
The disbanding has been going on for many years.

1171
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,660
Yes.

1172
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,660
The house is old.

1173
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,660
The hospital has been here for many years.

1174
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:47,480
What's going on with your

1175
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:58,660
Uncle,

1176
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,660
I need to go.

1177
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,660
You're going to eat, right?

1178
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,660
OK.

1179
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,660
I'll send you the message

1180
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,660
once I've booked your hospital.

1181
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,660
Come to my place

1182
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,660
and keep supporting my factory.

1183
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,660
OK.

1184
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,660
Of course.

1185
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:08,660
I'm leaving.

1186
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,660
Bye, Auntie Mei, Liu Yi.

1187
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,660
Uncle,

1188
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,660
it's your turn.

1189
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,660
Sit tight.

1190
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,660
Just give me the phone.

1191
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,660
Dr. Zhang, thank you.

1192
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,660
It's OK.

1193
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:18,660
I'll arrange it now.

1194
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,660
Thank you.

1195
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,660
Please go to the right room

1196
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,660
for the vaccine on 135.

1197
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,660
Add a miscellaneous message to 131.

1198
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,660
OK.

1199
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:27,660
I'll go right away.

1200
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,660
Tan,

1201
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,660
I know these hospitals.

1202
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,660
If you have any questions,

1203
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,660
you can ask me.

1204
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,660
Thank you, Dr. Zhang.

1205
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,660
Come back at noon.

1206
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,660
OK.

1207
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,660
Thank you, Director Zhou.

1208
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,660
It's lucky that you went.

1209
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:18,660
Otherwise,

1210
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,660
I would have been a mouth cancer.

1211
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:21,660
You're welcome.

1212
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,660
This is what we should do.

1213
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:24,660
Thank you so much.

1214
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,660
Director Zhou, let me take a picture for you.

1215
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,660
OK.

1216
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,660
100 faces.

1217
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,660
The first 100 faces.

1218
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,660
It's a pity

1219
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,660
that I should go.

1220
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:54,660
Zhou Dongcheng,

1221
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:57,660
Yu Shi,

1222
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,660
Liu Jie,

1223
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:03,660
Zhang Jun,

1224
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,660
Xiao Guan,

1225
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,660
Cheng Yun,

1226
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,660
Chen Minglan,

1227
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:16,660
Xia Yun,

1228
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:19,660
and you.

1229
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,660
I'm sorry.

1230
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,660
I'm sorry.

1231
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,660
I'm sorry.

1232
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,660
Hey,

1233
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,660
I'm a little flustered.

1234
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,660
I'm afraid that I'll become weak at night.

1235
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:04,660
I put on a white shirt

1236
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:09,660
and listened to the heartbeat.

1237
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,660
I put love in the blood

1238
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:17,660
and cured the fragile heart.

1239
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:22,660
I set out on a dream

1240
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:26,660
and walked a long and difficult journey.

1241
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:30,660
I was shocked and disappointed

1242
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:38,660
because I didn't want to open a dream.

1243
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:42,660
I watched the youthful bloom

1244
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:46,660
and I was stubborn.

1245
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:51,660
The light of life is lit at the moment.

1246
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:57,660
I was shocked and disappointed

1247
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:02,660
because I didn't want to open a dream.

1248
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:07,660
I was shocked and disappointed

1249
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:13,660
because I didn't want to open a dream.

1250
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:17,660
I was shocked and disappointed

1251
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,660
I was shocked and disappointed

1252
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:26,660
because I didn't want to open a dream.

1253
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,660
I was shocked and disappointed

1254
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,660
because I didn't want to open a dream.

1255
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:38,660
I watched the youthful bloom

1256
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:42,660
and I was stubborn.

1257
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:47,660
The light of life is lit at the moment.
