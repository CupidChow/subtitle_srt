1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
I'll be praying for you.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:02,780
Okay.

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,520
Keep following.

4
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,020
Good luck for the next upcoming season.

5
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:05,760
See you.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,020
To go to the city, always had someone

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,420
want to cry for you

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,660
brother is como fine and I have been

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,700
cool with me

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,760
A place can't describe

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,840
me with my makes atmosphere

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,600
code until the boss

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,140
you Стелto

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,880
heard their voice

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,120
no problem

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,900
singing

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,400
IG

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,140
lights are angry

19
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,840
fat

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,560
I swear

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:57,940
I always

22
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,600
out

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,920
Who opened the door of the hospital

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,320
The ugly and beautiful aunt

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,680
Or the neighbor's little ghost

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,480
I'm here, don't worry, he's talking

27
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,360
Open your mouth

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,120
My house is like a bread and a drink

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,520
The big water of the year

30
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,040
Open the big leaf of my white head

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,560
Don't be too consistent with me

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,720
Don't be too decisive

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,080
Little Chi has your alcohol

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,480
Only the people can resolve

35
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,560
Listen to my every song

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,360
Don't look at the big face and say ah yeah

37
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,720
The time is up

38
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,800
The watch is on

39
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Kneel on the suit

40
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,520
Look at the label, what is this?

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,840
Call a friend

42
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,200
Order a seat and immediately take it

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,560
Hurry up to go to death

44
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,920
L is sick tomorrow

45
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,920
I headed straight from J~?

46
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,760
To Meixi Lake

47
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,100
Look at the front

48
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,020
Straight, baby

49
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,460
Yes, stop at the back

50
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,780
Yes, look

51
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,300
Look ahead

52
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,700
Okay

53
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,340
Don't follow me

54
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,900
Stay away from me

55
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,420
The more you touch me, the less I can ride

56
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,860
I already know how to ride

57
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,780
Director

58
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,780
Be careful

59
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,740
Are you okay?

60
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,900
I'm fine

61
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,140
Is this your first time riding a bicycle?

62
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,700
No, I can ride

63
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,820
I didn't see it

64
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,020
Director, you're here to buy something?

65
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,780
It's the order from the old princess

66
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,500
Look at me, is it good?

67
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,820
You're riding so well

68
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,500
You're much better than this brother

69
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,380
Slow down

70
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:33,860
Bye

71
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,460
Bye

72
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,300
Bye, director

73
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,020
Bye

74
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,060
Bye, director

75
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,780
Slow down

76
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,820
You like her?

77
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,500
Yes

78
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,900
I like you riding a bicycle

79
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,140
And she likes Yi Yi

80
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,300
Jun

81
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,940
Yi Yi rides so well

82
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,420
Teach me some day

83
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,620
Okay

84
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,420
I'm very familiar with your eyes

85
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,020
The smell of love

86
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,100
How can it be, Jun?

87
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,180
It's okay

88
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,260
I won't tell anyone

89
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,260
I'm not going to tell anyone

90
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,540
I'm not going to tell anyone

91
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,540
I'm not going to tell anyone

92
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,540
I'm not going to tell anyone

93
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,540
I'm not going to tell anyone

94
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,540
I'm not going to tell anyone

95
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,940
Jun

96
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,900
I don't want others to know

97
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,420
Jun, you...

98
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,820
So you like her

99
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:35,980
Okay, okay

100
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,420
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone

101
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,260
But I'm afraid I might not be able to stand it

102
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,580
Good thing, good thing, good thing

103
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,260
I'll go buy some fruit

104
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,700
Forget it

105
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,100
Who likes you, you fool?

106
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,660
I have an appointment with someone

107
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,940
to do business outside

108
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,540
At 1 p.m.

109
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,140
Xiao Xu

110
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,420
Can you come down and see me?

111
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,380
I want to say goodbye to you

112
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,660
When my parents used to argue when I was a kid

113
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,700
I thought about it every day

114
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,020
If they divorced, who would I follow?

115
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,180
I'd choose my dad

116
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,020
I'd choose my dad

117
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,140
But because I chose my back

118
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,140
I chose my dad

119
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,980
When I was in high school

120
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,620
I wanted to choose science

121
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,780
I wanted to choose physics

122
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,420
Baby chose liberal arts

123
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,860
But I followed my own path

124
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,740
After my dad passed away

125
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,540
I had a chance to choose again

126
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,220
Stay here?

127
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,660
Stay in the community hospital?

128
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,620
Or not?

129
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,540
The front is people

130
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,500
The back is not people

131
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,140
Of course, the results are the same every time

132
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,580
It's all back and forth

133
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,700
But every time

134
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,700
I followed my own choice

135
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,460
Xiao Xu, I'm late

136
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,580
I'm leaving at 11 p.m.

137
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,780
Xiao Xu, why are you still sleeping?

138
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,980
It's time to go to school

139
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,620
Why are you still sleeping?

140
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,220
Get up, get up, get up

141
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,220
What time is it?

142
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,620
No, no

143
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,980
No, I'm telling you

144
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,380
We can't be late again today

145
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,180
Do you know?

146
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,220
Your teacher Li

147
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,980
You're scolding your dad in front of the whole class

148
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,220
Is it ugly?

149
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,460
No

150
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,340
No, you sleep

151
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,660
What time can you sleep?

152
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
No, no, no, no, no

153
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,620
OK, OK, OK, OK

154
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,620
OK, OK, OK, OK

155
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,620
OK, OK, OK, OK

156
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,620
You, you, you, you, you

157
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,620
I'm going to take you out

158
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,860
Go and wash your face

159
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,140
Come on, Xiao Xu

160
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,620
I prepared a birthday cake for you

161
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,620
Birthday cake

162
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,820
Happy?

163
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,620
Happy

164
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,620
Happy, good

165
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,620
Come on, come on

166
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,620
Hold it, hold it

167
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,020
I'm focused

168
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,620
Light it up, open the shutter

169
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,620
Look at the camera

170
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,620
OK

171
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,620
I still have to give you a cake

172
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,620
Look at the camera, look at the camera

173
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,620
Don't touch

174
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,620
I like you

175
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,620
Yeah

176
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,620
Actually, this game has no meaning

177
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,620
What's meaningful is

178
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,620
Make us confirm

179
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,620
My heart's choice

180
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,820
I will always stand by your side and to support you.

181
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
I will always look forward to it.

182
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,480
Okay?

183
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,340
Boss, I'm off work now.

184
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,340
I won Zhang Longgan and went to the Tibetan region with him to work on medicine.

185
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,340
I used to rely on this to get a raise.

186
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,340
Now, it's still useful.

187
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,340
This time, I was just thinking...

188
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,340
Yao Xue, I won't say anything to you.

189
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,340
It's not because you're not important.

190
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,340
It's because you're too important.

191
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,340
I really don't know what to do.

192
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,340
I promise you that I'll tell you everything.

193
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,340
I'll tell you the truth.

194
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,340
If you need anything, call me or text me.

195
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,340
I'll be there in ten minutes.

196
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,340
I'll tell you everything.

197
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,340
Son.

198
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,340
Sir, faster.

199
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,340
You're suspicious, aren't you?

200
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,340
The suspicious means that the oil did not re-send.

201
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,340
The doctor said the same thing, didn't he?

202
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,340
I'm talking to you. What's wrong with you?

203
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,340
You're suspicious, aren't you?

204
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,860
The patient is in a bad condition

205
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,700
Please help

206
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,980
I'm talking to you

207
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,100
What's wrong with you?

208
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,380
The patient is in a bad condition

209
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,740
You came out of the doctor's office

210
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,700
You didn't tell me

211
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,860
what's going on

212
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,740
I'm not talking to you

213
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,420
What am I talking to you?

214
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,220
I'm talking about the secret in your cell phone

215
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,620
They told you about this?

216
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,460
What do you think?

217
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,580
You're ridiculous

218
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,660
Fine

219
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,820
If they are cheated again next time

220
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,660
I won't help them anymore

221
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,180
I won't help them anymore

222
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
Help them?

223
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,180
You help them?

224
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,180
Or they play with you

225
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,980
as a retired police?

226
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,620
What do you mean?

227
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,740
Lin

228
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,420
I can finally tell you the truth today

229
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,020
I've been holding it in my heart for a long time

230
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,420
I'm telling you

231
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,860
Dr. Zhao, Dr. Zhang, Liu Jing

232
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,700
I'm afraid that before you see the report

233
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,820
you will suspect

234
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,700
all your problems

235
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,900
I'm afraid that you'll break yourself

236
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,740
I'm afraid that you'll break me

237
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,380
They pretend to be hiding something from you

238
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,420
They pretend to be cheated

239
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,180
for your attention

240
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,900
You know?

241
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,340
I see

242
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,740
Thank them

243
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,900
After I see them

244
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,460
I must say thanks to them

245
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,660
to tell them

246
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,820
I'm sorry for what they said

247
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,140
You finally understand

248
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,940
He's been looking for you

249
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,700
You are very important to him

250
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,660
He even was forced to stay here

251
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,580
to work for you

252
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,420
But you just denied it

253
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,620
He is your son

254
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,380
You don't want to go to jail

255
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,860
for this right?

256
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,580
Is success

257
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,180
important to your business?

258
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,260
For him what's important is

259
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,740
he is a man that has a father

260
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,780
Let's wait for one more day

261
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:19,760
for us to morbidly return the

262
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,860
於

263
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,380
Shun Lou,

264
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,400
I knew that you wouldn't

265
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,580
deny

266
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,440
that you trusted me before.

267
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,840
I was too excited just now.

268
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,440
Xiao Xue, thank Zhao Dong Cheng for me.

269
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,960
He helped me.

270
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,920
He will be a good brother.

271
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,080
What does he help you be a good brother?

272
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,280
Old Lin, money.

273
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,440
Zhao Dong Cheng, let me ask you.

274
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,200
Did you give money to Guan Shan?

275
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,200
What money?

276
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,800
That's your own money.

277
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,160
You can't give it to him.

278
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,640
I can't give it to him.

279
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,640
It's my own money.

280
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,600
I can give it to whoever I want.

281
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,120
Are you crazy, Brother?

282
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,400
What did you call me?

283
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,920
No.

284
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
Then why did Old Lin say your money was cheated?

285
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,720
You gave him the money,

286
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,480
right?

287
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,440
This is for you.

288
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,920
Don't give it to me.

289
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,840
I have a lot of money.

290
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
And I'm a doctor.

291
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,280
It's not suitable for me to take it.

292
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,520
I don't want to be your patient.

293
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
I like you.

294
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,320
I know it's sudden.

295
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,920
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

296
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,520
But I really, really, really like you.

297
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,480
Kang Kang, I think

298
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,680
you may rely on me because I helped you.

299
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,680
But you are not real love.

300
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,320
How do you know it's not?

301
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,880
The feeling in your heart is the realest feeling.

302
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,040
That may be because I am your doctor.

303
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,960
You are my patient.

304
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,600
So our relationship

305
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,640
may cause you to misunderstand

306
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,200
our relationship.

307
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,760
I don't like you because you are my doctor.

308
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,400
It's because you are the first one to tell me

309
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,880
to be my own person.

310
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,720
Since I accepted myself,

311
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,320
I found that I had become better.

312
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,280
It's you who changed me.

313
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,720
Well, first of all, I'm very grateful that you like me.

314
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,520
But I'm very sorry.

315
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,560
I can't accept your kindness to me.

316
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,400
Because I've always had a girl in my heart.

317
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,360
Before I get her accurate answer,

318
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,960
I can't accept your kindness.

319
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
I have to be responsible for my own feelings.

320
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,920
I have to be responsible for your feelings.

321
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,360
So I hope you can understand me.

322
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,760
I'm sorry.

323
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,000
I have something to do. I have to go.

324
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,880
Bye.

325
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,640
Zhao Dongcheng, I still don't understand.

326
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,080
Tell me why he wants to thank you.

327
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Why?

328
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,080
Who? Who?

329
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,200
My dad.

330
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,400
Guan Shan.

331
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,800
How can I know?

332
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,160
I'm sleeping.

333
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,040
I'm asking you.

334
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,720
Don't you want to know what kind of fish he likes?

335
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,600
You don't want to know now?

336
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,320
Don't give me a specific topic.

337
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
Don't know.

338
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,360
I don't want to know about fish.

339
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,720
I want to know more about why Guan Shan wants to thank you.

340
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,280
I'm thinking if you and Yu Shi fight in the future,

341
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,040
who will I support?

342
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,080
Give me your pen.

343
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,680
You're so naughty.

344
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,400
There are many different fathers in this world.

345
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,360
Of course there are many different father-son relationship.

346
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,880
But for each of us,

347
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,600
there is only one kind.

348
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,520
You can say he is a bastard.

349
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,160
Not a good father.

350
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,760
The other side of the coin that he never wants to know.

351
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,000
You bastard.

352
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,400
I hate you.

353
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,680
I'll kill you.

354
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,720
But no matter what,

355
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,400
he raised me.

356
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,960
He also created me.

357
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And

358
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,360
he belongs to me.

359
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
I'm sorry.

362
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
I'm sorry.

364
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
I'm sorry.

365
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
I'm sorry.

367
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
I'm sorry.

368
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
I'm sorry.

369
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
I'm sorry.

371
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
I'm sorry.

372
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I'm sorry.

377
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
I'm sorry.

380
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
I'm sorry.

381
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
I'm sorry.

383
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
I'm sorry.

384
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
I'm sorry.

385
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
I'm sorry.

386
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
I'm sorry.

388
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
I'm sorry.

389
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
I'm sorry.

390
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
I'm sorry.

394
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
I'm sorry.

396
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
I'm sorry.

397
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
I'm sorry.

399
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Thank you.

400
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Morning.

401
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,720
Are you free today?

402
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
I'm busy these days.

403
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
I don't feel well all the time.

404
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,560
I've slept four times a day recently.

405
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Can you get up for ther?

406
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Sure.

407
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
It's bright outside.

408
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,160
Mom, show me your gifts.

409
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Look.

410
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
They're everywhere.

411
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
I have 2 millimeter assistants.

412
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Oh my god.

413
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,160
you are grown up now finger playing

414
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Stop yourself.

415
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,160
These are my Yes Doll PowerPoint Outlets.

416
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
I'm taking a bath!

417
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
I'll go whenever he wants.

418
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,360
How are you doing

419
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,160
You can take a bath

420
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Okay.

421
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,760
Mom

422
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,800
I bought a fruit knife last time

423
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Which fruit knife?

424
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,760
The long one

425
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,800
I put away the long one

426
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,120
Why did you put it away?

427
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,360
It's useful

428
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,120
There are so many knives at home

429
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,560
I have told you many times

430
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,240
Cut vegetables with a knife

431
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,400
Cut fruits with a fruit knife

432
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,240
Otherwise, you will have a smelly taste

433
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,120
when you cut vegetables

434
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
I don't know if I eat

435
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,520
ham and melon or ham and green onion today

436
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't know when I can eat it together

437
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,680
There is no smelly taste of ham and melon

438
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,520
Where is the smelly taste?

439
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,880
It's delicious

440
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,040
Dongcheng

441
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,600
Can you come to my house?

442
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,480
Are you hungry?

443
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,440
I can't give you to eat

444
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,520
Oh

445
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,040
this is the first time I can live with her

446
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,120
with allaluants

447
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,120
Xiaoju

448
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,600
it's raining outside

449
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,920
I'll go Master Zhao's house

450
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,920
I'll go buy some medicine

451
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,440
I'm afraid I'll get a cold

452
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,800
Mom, where did you put it?

453
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,520
Are you old enough to remember?

454
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,240
Dad

455
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
These things will be ours sooner or later

456
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,840
Take out the house certificate

457
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,000
Sell the house and buy a house

458
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's a hassle

459
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,200
Yes, dad

460
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,400
Where did you put it?

461
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,800
What are you doing?

462
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,880
Miss Xu, you're finally back

463
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,040
Get out

464
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,440
Get out now

465
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
What's wrong, Xiaoxiao?

466
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,880
You didn't even call your uncle

467
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,160
and you're asking us to leave?

468
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,520
Can't I come and see the old man?

469
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,120
You're really the same

470
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,640
He didn't take you as his uncle

471
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,760
Your mom ran away with him

472
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,120
Your dad never asked about it

473
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,320
You're his uncle

474
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,920
You really treat him like your family

475
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,120
Look, he saw you

476
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,360
His face was pulled down

477
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,400
Didn't you see it?

478
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,680
I'm warning you, mom

479
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,320
Grandpa is resting inside

480
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,520
You should leave now

481
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,520
Otherwise, don't blame me

482
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
for being a backup

483
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,920
Little blind man

484
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,040
I'll go and see Mr. Sheng

485
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,520
Mr. Sheng

486
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,000
Xiao Qiao

487
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,640
Your dad has already passed away

488
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,440
What are you doing here?

489
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,240
Xiao Qiao

490
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,520
Don't think I don't know

491
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,360
what you're up to

492
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,960
I'm playing with my phone

493
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,720
Dad's face is not good-looking

494
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,800
Look at that little blind man

495
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,680
How can he take care of an old man?

496
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Let me tell you

497
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,640
When I came out with him

498
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,200
I almost recognized him

499
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,480
Make some noise

500
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,520
Okay

501
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,800
Come over here

502
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,080
Coming

503
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,920
Okay

504
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,320
Mother

505
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,920
When he bells,

506
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,080
he'll feel happy.

507
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,280
How's this which is on your mind when you hear it?

508
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,640
No one will talk it out.

509
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,840
Yes, but you moved to another country

510
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,040
It's Your question,

511
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,600
Selected Mar comet

512
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,960
For aA

513
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,840
No matter what he thinks,

514
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,760
how can I BL12

515
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,720
or something like that?

516
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
The world is big.

517
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,800
I'm very happy.

518
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,840
There's no one so good in the world

519
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,280
A girl should know the rules

520
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,480
Now you get married and have children

521
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,920
That's the right thing to do

522
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,120
That's right

523
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
Take out the property certificate

524
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,280
Sell the house and take care of the house

525
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,760
And take out the deposit

526
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,680
Your uncle and his family

527
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,880
Think so too

528
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,440
Go

529
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,000
What are you doing?

530
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,440
Go out

531
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,080
Uncle, look

532
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,680
Your uncle and aunt

533
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,600
They are all good people

534
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,160
Look, now

535
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,560
They still have

536
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,520
To tell you

537
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,880
And

538
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,440
You have to write a warranty

539
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,680
And make sure that

540
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,240
The things here

541
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,560
Can't be taken away at all

542
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,680
Uncle, I'm here today

543
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,240
Do a witness

544
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,920
Get out

545
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,360
No, uncle, listen

546
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,160
Listen to this kid

547
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,440
Uncle, look

548
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,640
Can't talk about this kid

549
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,480
Is that how you talk?

550
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,560
That's right

551
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,800
I just checked the situation

552
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,760
Inside

553
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,920
The situation is stable

554
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,040
But the medicine can't be broken

555
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,800
You are his son

556
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,440
This is the prescription I prescribed

557
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,440
I'll tell you where to buy the medicine

558
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,160
Later

559
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,760
I'll tell you in advance

560
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,640
These are imported anti-corruption drugs

561
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,400
Not within the scope of medical insurance

562
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,240
I guess

563
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,200
You may have to prepare

564
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,080
A lot of money

565
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,400
Or you can have a look

566
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,880
No, I don't understand

567
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,640
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

568
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,160
You look for him

569
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,080
Xiaoqiang

570
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,360
You, you, you, you, you, you, you

571
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,200
You, you, you, you, you, you, you

572
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,760
You, you, you, you, you, you, you

573
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,640
You, you, you, you, you, you

574
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,360
Why are you giving it to me?

575
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,680
You look for him, I don't have money

576
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,920
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

577
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,440
I'm an outsider

578
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,840
In other words

579
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,600
Teacher Shi is still resting inside

580
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,640
Not feeling well

581
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,680
If you have any disputes

582
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,800
Or call the police

583
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,400
Or we go to the police station together

584
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,040
A knife is a knife of value.

585
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,720
Look at this.

586
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,080
Look.

587
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,160
Don't look at me.

588
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,080
I can't find you.

589
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,520
They gave me this cutting panel.

590
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:20,720
Well,

591
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,360
Shall we check it?

592
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,840
No, no.

593
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,400
This...

594
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:23,880
Let's discuss it later.

595
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,460
Uncle.

596
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,720
You...

597
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,760
Look for it.

598
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,000
Look for it.

599
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,600
Give it to me.

600
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,540
We will be back

601
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,680
Xia powder

602
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
I feel so anxious

603
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,840
It's much better

604
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,880
than being so close to him

605
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,760
Liujin

606
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,760
Wang Kengkeng

607
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,120
is getting more and more anxious

608
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,560
Why hasn't she seen him for a long time?

609
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,640
How should I know?

610
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,400
You should know

611
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,320
She always comes to see me

612
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,880
She came in when you were here

613
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,000
She looks so dull

614
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,760
She's cute

615
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
She is cute

616
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,800
Anyway

617
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,440
she won't come here again

618
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,960
Does that girl

619
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,720
like Liujin?

620
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,440
Maybe

621
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,080
But she said she wouldn't come here again

622
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,400
Did she

623
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,000
refuse her girlfriend?

624
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
No way

625
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,920
I don't know

626
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,760
You're so pitiful

627
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,400
I could have given them the house

628
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,960
But I don't understand

629
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,240
Now all these people

630
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,680
say that

631
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,120
family is the most important thing

632
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,120
But did they really meet with trouble?

633
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,560
They have their own problems

634
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,760
and their own reasons

635
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,600
The family is always put in the last place

636
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,960
and always sacrificed

637
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
I can understand

638
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,760
Everyone has their own difficulties

639
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,680
I didn't ask them to be like me

640
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,960
They don't want to take care of grandpa

641
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,920
and want to push me away

642
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,520
I can take the responsibility

643
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,880
But why do they think

644
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,840
they can't do what they can't do?

645
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,880
And no one else can do it?

646
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,880
Why do they think

647
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,080
I'm selfish

648
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,360
when they see others do it?

649
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,840
What Kengkeng said

650
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,040
really hurts me

651
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,280
Why can they do this?

652
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,560
Why does the world do this?

653
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,400
The world is different

654
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,240
After I graduated from college

655
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,760
I gave up the college entrance exam

656
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,400
and went to the Triangle Hospital

657
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,400
I chose the community hospital

658
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,760
to take care of my sick father

659
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,040
After a while

660
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,520
I heard a lot of voices

661
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,400
It's because of my college graduation

662
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,160
I had a major accident

663
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
when I was an intern

664
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,800
I didn't have the hospital to take me

665
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,000
So I came back here

666
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,800
The world hasn't changed

667
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,880
What we need to adjust is

668
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,400
how we see the world

669
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,600
What should I do?

670
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,560
I'll teach you a lesson

671
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,560
As long as you can remember

672
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,840
you can solve

673
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,440
90% of the problems in the world

674
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,840
Do you want to hear it?

675
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,120
It's none of your business

676
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,560
It's none of your business

677
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,160
You know nothing

678
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,920
The world hasn't changed

679
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,960
Director, it's fixed

680
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,000
Come and have a look

681
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,200
Okay

682
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,400
It's smooth

683
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,440
and smooth

684
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,720
It's just a door

685
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,520
I thought you

686
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,640
built a palace

687
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,200
How is it?

688
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,400
Not bad, right?

689
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,440
Don't push it

690
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,720
You'll tear it apart later

691
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,000
The price

692
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,400
There's something wrong with the price

693
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,760
I'll buy a new one

694
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,400
Wait a minute

695
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,480
Like this

696
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,440
Go

697
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,640
6.1 grams of protein

698
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,280
Good

699
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,280
9.9 grams of carbon dioxide

700
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
The chili sauce is quite spicy today

701
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,200
It's delicious

702
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,920
You like it?

703
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,320
I'll buy some for you

704
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,040
Good

705
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,080
Stop looking

706
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,040
Go and play

707
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,320
No

708
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,920
I can't move until I'm full

709
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,200
It's good for digestion

710
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,960
I don't want to go either

711
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,320
Today

712
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,360
we'll move a chair

713
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,160
and sunbathe

714
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,400
It'll be more fragrant if we sleep

715
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,160
Right

716
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,120
You want to go?

717
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,400
You want to play?

718
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,040
Let's go

719
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,240
There's a tea shop

720
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,200
that sells tea

721
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,880
The delivery boy

722
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,160
is quite handsome

723
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,120
Let's go

724
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,160
Bye

725
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,200
Lemon tea

726
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,880
I want to go too

727
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,040
No principle

728
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,760
Go

729
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,160
One

730
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:50,960
Right

731
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,440
Take it

732
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,240
Then

733
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,600
When you turn back

734
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,480
you just swing it

735
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,040
Swing

736
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,480
Then kick this leg

737
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,200
Take it

738
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,800
It's professional

739
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,800
6.1 grams is good

740
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,040
The delivery boy

741
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,440
is professional

742
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,000
Right

743
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,040
The delivery boy

744
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,400
is good at playing

745
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,360
I'll show you

746
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,600
I'll hit you

747
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,400
6.1 grams

748
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,360
My ass

749
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
How's the delivery boy?

750
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,640
Is he handsome?

751
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,320
The delivery boy is a liar

752
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,320
The tea is delicious

753
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,840
6.1 grams, go

754
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,160
Go

755
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,160
Go

756
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,080
Try it

757
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,880
Come on

758
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,360
Go

759
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,280
This is called a talent

760
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,120
His legs are still very sharp

761
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,880
I'm sleepy

762
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,560
He didn't even move much

763
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,680
He's almost tired

764
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,520
The old waist is not very sharp

765
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,120
He played as a bodyguard

766
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,480
Right

767
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,040
I'm old

768
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,080
Hit it again

769
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,520
I'll hit you

770
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,080
How many times?

771
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,440
I can't

772
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,240
Come on, who's going to hit it?

773
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,200
I'll do it

774
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,640
Come on, hurry up

775
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,280
I want to hit it

776
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:17,440
Come on

777
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,880
You said you wanted to hit it when you were eating

778
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,520
Yes

779
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,000
Come on

780
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,520
I can't come

781
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,720
The doctor called me

782
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,360
I have to answer it

783
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,360
The delivery boy, you're shouting

784
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,000
Baby

785
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,520
Did you see it?

786
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,480
Don't hit it

787
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,680
Hit it again

788
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,680
Hit it again

789
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,160
I don't hit it

790
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,120
I don't play with Cai Ji

791
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,000
You can't hit it

792
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,280
I can be your master if I hit it

793
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,880
I don't think you can hit it

794
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,600
I'll do it

795
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,120
Why are you here?

796
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,160
I can't come

797
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,960
You can

798
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,960
I'm here to find the doctor

799
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,680
To report

800
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,040
I'm looking for you

801
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,200
Hit it or not?

802
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,040
You hit it in this way

803
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,400
You hit it?

804
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm afraid I'll hit your shoes like a fish

805
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,520
Come on

806
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,160
You need to take it

807
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,160
Liu Xun, score

808
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,240
You're not so serious

809
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,760
You hit it

810
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,600
Brother

811
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,600
You don't even know who he is

812
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,080
I know

813
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,520
He is a temporary doctor

814
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,160
Who came to the hospital this afternoon

815
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,120
Dr. Xiao Han

816
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,920
The first in the People's Hospital

817
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,200
The Department of Inhalation and Intravenous Surgery

818
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,280
He is good at treating respiratory system diseases

819
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,880
Especially for chronic

820
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,840
Stomach cancer

821
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,720
And lung cancer

822
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,240
He has enough experience in this area

823
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,600
How do you know so clearly?

824
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,040
I wrote the expert report

825
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,800
You can't beat me in leather shoes, can you?

826
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,920
I'm begging you for nothing

827
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,720
This is too much

828
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,400
Brother, you're so

829
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,960
This is good

830
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,480
You know something

831
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,280
The additional foot scab

832
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,240
Should be better

833
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,040
You won't hurt him

834
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,160
No

835
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,600
This foot scab

836
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,080
Give me a minute

837
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,920
Come on

838
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:36,800
Sister,

839
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,760
you GP

840
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,160
It'suisable

841
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,280
If you take it

842
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,040
What are you doing?

843
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,560
I'm not playing

844
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,400
You hit me so seriously

845
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,720
I can't even hit you

846
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,440
You're serious

847
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,840
Zhao Dongcheng

848
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,280
You're not good at medicine

849
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,080
nor at playing ball

850
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,080
It seems that

851
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,120
you're not good at physical fitness

852
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,440
You don't need me to be serious

853
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,720
If you have any problems

854
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,560
remember to come to me

855
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,560
But you can do it privately

856
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,880
Otherwise, you can come to me in the hospital

857
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,960
It's hard to get a good shot

858
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,160
Come on, next one

859
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,200
Bye, doctor

860
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,360
Ruijin

861
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,280
Bye

862
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,200
Who's playing?

863
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,680
Why is he so pretentious?

864
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,840
He's been like this for more than ten years

865
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,240
Can he talk?

866
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,360
Brother Jun, come on

867
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,200
Okay, okay, it's over

868
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,400
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming

869
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,080
You're the one who's playing badminton

870
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,320
He didn't take away a 11 to 3

871
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,880
So good

872
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
Of course, you can't see it

873
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,640
He's dirty, Brother Jun

874
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,720
Come on, come on

875
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,360
Listen to them

876
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,040
They listen to me

877
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,720
I listen to you

878
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,000
Come on

879
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,120
The doctor didn't say anything

880
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,160
I pity you

881
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,560
Please turn off the power

882
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,080
and go to the private room

883
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,040
Please turn off the power

884
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,640
and go to the private room

885
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,680
Why are you here?

886
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,240
You gave me all these

887
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,760
Don't say anything

888
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,120
I'm so tired, Jun

889
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,000
What's wrong with you?

890
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,480
I won't talk to you today

891
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,080
I'm going back to take care of my hands

892
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,920
I'm leaving

893
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,320
Wait a minute

894
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,800
What's wrong with you, Jun?

895
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
I'm not

896
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,920
Aren't you touched?

897
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,600
I'm not moved by anything

898
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,640
But now

899
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,120
it's all the same

900
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,680
I express my love and gratitude

901
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,400
You

902
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,240
Bye bye

903
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,560
No

904
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,960
Goodbye

905
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,400
Thank you for your snacks

906
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,960
Jun

907
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,000
What's up?

908
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,280
The director asked me to be your delivery man

909
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,240
This is 11

910
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,160
One latte

911
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,920
and one Americano

912
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,120
You can have any one you want

913
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,120
And this

914
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,240
My brother went to the night market

915
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
and asked me to get you the pork oil rice noodles

916
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,600
Your brother is still running at night

917
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,760
You're healthy

918
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,920
Listen to me

919
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,160
I can't drink these two cups of coffee

920
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,960
You can take one back

921
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,800
No, no, brother

922
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,680
You still have this

923
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,680
You're eating so much

924
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,640
You can drink it while eating

925
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,560
Then you can have one

926
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,760
No, no, I'm leaving

927
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,720
You should be careful

928
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,240
No, no, I really don't want to eat

929
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,240
I really don't want to eat

930
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,880
Director, why are you here?

931
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,320
I brought my kid out

932
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,680
to have a look at the swimming pool

933
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,680
You can open a supermarket here

934
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,920
I'll take it

935
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,400
No need to clean up

936
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,520
You still have time to take the shift

937
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
You should hurry up and eat

938
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,200
You're the only one who will be the delivery man tonight

939
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,000
If you need anything

940
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,320
just send a message to the group

941
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,240
You can also call

942
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,400
We'll keep our phones open

943
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,000
Okay

944
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:52,960
By the way

945
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,680
I've given all the nurses outside

946
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,320
These

947
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,480
are not for afternoon tea

948
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,640
They're not enough

949
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,240
Have this

950
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,320
Eat it while it's hot

951
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,200
Eat it while it's hot

952
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,960
Director, take this coffee

953
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,280
and leave

954
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,960
No need

955
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,600
Thank you, director

956
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,200
Director

957
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,120
You...

958
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,920
Director

959
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,640
Open the door

960
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,800
Give me the medicine

961
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,640
Give me the medicine

962
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,240
It's travelling hours

963
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,280
Give me the medicine

964
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:32,800
Hurry up

965
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,640
Open the door

966
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,080
Doctor Zha

967
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,480
Sorry, sorry

968
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,880
Did I scare you?

969
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,280
Listen

970
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,480
Who is it?

971
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,840
I don't know

972
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,880
He was knocking on the door

973
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
He said he wanted to take the medicine

974
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,880
I was afraid

975
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,840
Take the medicine?

976
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,280
It's so late

977
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,800
It's three o'clock

978
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,680
He came to take the medicine

979
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,360
It's three o'clock, right?

980
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,560
But I came here

981
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,960
but there was no medicine

982
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,080
It means a serious problem

983
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
It's your problem

984
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,480
in the management

985
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,200
Yes, Uncle Liu

986
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
I'm sorry to keep you waiting

987
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,000
Well

988
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,360
We have changed the time

989
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,720
We will open at eight o'clock in the morning

990
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,720
Look at you

991
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,920
No

992
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,560
It was three o'clock last time

993
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
and it was three o'clock in the morning

994
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,880
I didn't remember it wrong, right?

995
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,560
Uncle, don't worry

996
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,560
Here is the thing

997
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,000
I didn't say you remember it wrong

998
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,320
We changed the time

999
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,480
We want to ask you

1000
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,720
to remember it again

1001
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,920
Is it okay?

1002
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,400
Okay

1003
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,080
But for the sake of

1004
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,120
your long time

1005
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,320
Okay

1006
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,440
Uncle

1007
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,320
I taught you

1008
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,000
such a surgery before

1009
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,880
Do you remember?

1010
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,320
It's our Xiaoyun

1011
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,160
No matter his temper or patience

1012
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,400
he is smart

1013
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,920
Xiaoyun is the most smart

1014
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,840
I learned the battle technique

1015
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,600
You don't know

1016
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,240
Gao Yang

1017
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,760
Help me measure my blood pressure

1018
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,920
I'll go to find Xia's family

1019
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Uncle Liu

1020
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,280
Do you remember the surgery

1021
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,800
Xiaoyun did for you

1022
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,040
the defense game?

1023
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,400
Director Chen

1024
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,280
Everything is normal

1025
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,560
Emotion is stable

1026
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,600
Everything is normal

1027
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,000
Thank you

1028
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,280
Thank you, Xiaoyun

1029
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:20,960
By the way

1030
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,560
Have you seen Director Zhou?

1031
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,680
I've been here all morning

1032
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,560
but I haven't seen him

1033
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,440
He hasn't come yet

1034
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,840
He came early in the morning

1035
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,360
He is waiting in the new store

1036
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,920
He said Guan Xu and Zhao Dongcheng

1037
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,720
had a lot of things to do today

1038
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,800
He is going to be the doctor

1039
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,880
You can go ahead

1040
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,160
Dr. Xiao

1041
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,680
We have arranged your examination

1042
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,120
The bathroom is on the right

1043
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,720
It's not time for work yet

1044
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,080
You can take a rest

1045
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,360
Dr. Xiao, thank you

1046
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,680
I've been here before

1047
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,320
I know that

1048
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,720
It's two years ago

1049
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,520
I'm afraid you forget it

1050
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,840
If I hadn't been sent out for further training last year

1051
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,640
I would come here every year to do the examination

1052
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,120
Experts are different

1053
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,800
We doctors

1054
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,080
must have a purpose

1055
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,480
By the way, Dr. Xiao

1056
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,680
You should go to rest

1057
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,680
If there is anything else

1058
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,880
I'll ask the doctor directly

1059
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,960
Cheng Pei is in charge of the door examination

1060
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,040
You can find me if you need something

1061
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,880
The assistant is too busy

1062
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,520
Don't bother him

1063
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,960
OK, thank you for your help

1064
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,000
Dr. Zhao

1065
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,560
Dr. Zhao

1066
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,960
Sister, you are all wearing the number of Dr. Xiao

1067
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,920
Yes, yes

1068
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,040
Dongcheng, let me show you

1069
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,680
Come in, come in

1070
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,360
OK

1071
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,120
Let me listen to it

1072
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,880
Take off the bandage

1073
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,880
Let me see

1074
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,520
No, no

1075
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,360
You cough, right?

1076
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,560
Yes, at night

1077
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,840
You can't breathe because of the short chest, right?

1078
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,160
Dongzang, it's been half a year

1079
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,560
Sometimes if you are in a hurry

1080
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,440
you can't breathe

1081
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,320
I have a chronic lung disease

1082
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,040
I have a chronic stomach disease

1083
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,240
It's a little troublesome

1084
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,400
You should treat it well

1085
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,160
Otherwise, it will recur

1086
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,600
I'll give you a long-term treatment

1087
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,160
It's the best

1088
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,680
I'm taking Satoxin-an powder

1089
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,720
You must take the prescribed dose every day

1090
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,720
Come to check it after a week

1091
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,600
If it doesn't have a very obvious effect

1092
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,080
you may need to do further examination

1093
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,960
I heard that the experts of the Three Gorges Hospital are here today

1094
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,440
I also feel that

1095
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,440
I see

1096
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,560
You should go to her after you see me

1097
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,800
My husband is waiting for me at the door

1098
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,440
He is old and has many problems

1099
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,560
He wants to see Director Xiao Han

1100
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,160
to help me with the disease

1101
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,240
and find more doctors

1102
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,480
Is it OK?

1103
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,880
No problem, no problem

1104
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,480
I'll tell Director Zhou later

1105
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,440
to ask those experts to come to our hospital

1106
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:57,840
Right?

1107
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,200
Don't waste time

1108
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,400
Dongzhe is thoughtful

1109
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,000
Go now

1110
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,520
OK

1111
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,960
OK

1112
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,640
Take care

1113
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,520
Ice, ice

1114
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,880
He is old

1115
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,400
and he is not smart

1116
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,520
OK, thank you

1117
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,360
It's OK, it's OK

1118
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,360
Next one

1119
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,200
What's wrong?

1120
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,560
anz Reid

1121
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,080
Is Liu Cheng Ifeng here?

1122
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,280
I don't know

1123
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,520
I will wait for a while

1124
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,040
Thank you

1125
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,960
Is he still there?

1126
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,360
Yes

1127
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,360
Please say it

1128
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,880
He is waiting for us

1129
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,400
Today

1130
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,520
Yes

1131
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,040
We have a number of experts

1132
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,000
Either u or you

1133
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,480
Wait a minute

1134
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:00,880
OK

1135
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,440
I'm not sick

1136
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,520
Why should I do a kidney test?

1137
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,440
Listen to me, brother

1138
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,960
It's just a kidney test

1139
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,520
Don't be afraid

1140
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,000
Come on, sit here

1141
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,560
I'm not sick

1142
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,400
Why should I do a kidney test?

1143
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,160
I'm not sick

1144
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,080
Why should I do a kidney test?

1145
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,000
What are you doing? Don't come over

1146
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,920
What about the orange?

1147
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,800
You want to coax me with the orange?

1148
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,040
I'm in good health

1149
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,160
Why should I do a kidney test?

1150
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:19,520
What's wrong?

1151
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,800
I don't want to do it

1152
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,120
Juanli, what's wrong?

1153
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,600
Tell me what's wrong

1154
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,080
Brother, brother

1155
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:24,440
What are you doing?

1156
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,560
Look at you

1157
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,080
Do you like it? Do you want it?

1158
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,360
I'll give it to you after you finish the test, okay?

1159
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,880
What's wrong with you?

1160
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,200
You're so clumsy

1161
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,800
Listen

1162
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,760
You should promote

1163
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,960
Jingju and Suzhou Pingtan

1164
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,920
His tune is

1165
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,880
Su Shan, power is unparalleled

1166
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,960
The strong will come to us

1167
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,280
Director, I think we should

1168
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,040
just marry him one by one

1169
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,600
I think so

1170
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,160
I heard Su Shan calling the people

1171
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,320
Brother

1172
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,440
I won't do any test

1173
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,480
No, no, no

1174
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,960
We'll take you to eat something delicious

1175
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,640
Yes, yes, yes

1176
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,560
Okay

1177
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,640
Let's go

1178
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,360
You know what?

1179
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,680
I love Suzhou noodles most

1180
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,440
It's okay

1181
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,560
You don't have to be afraid

1182
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,640
Let's go upstairs

1183
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,600
Family

1184
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,160
Where are you?

1185
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,240
What's wrong, brother?

1186
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,200
No

1187
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,600
It hurts

1188
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,680
You lied to me

1189
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,720
It hurts

1190
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,520
Brother, brother

1191
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,880
We're doctors

1192
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,760
We won't lie to you

1193
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,160
Don't worry

1194
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,080
The test is not scary at all

1195
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,000
It's over in a second

1196
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,600
Yes, yes, yes

1197
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,120
I believe you

1198
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,240
What's wrong with you, uncle?

1199
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,000
Miss Xia, you're here at the right time

1200
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,280
They lied to me

1201
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,600
No, uncle Liu

1202
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,880
They're doctors

1203
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,080
They won't lie to you

1204
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,960
How about this?

1205
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,920
I'll do the new year's test with you

1206
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,160
Do you think it's fun?

1207
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,600
It doesn't hurt at all

1208
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,000
You just lie down after you go in

1209
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,200
Close your eyes and open them

1210
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,760
There's no time for a song

1211
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,360
It's over

1212
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,400
Then

1213
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,320
Doctor Shen, do you have your headphones?

1214
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,120
No

1215
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,240
I'll play you a relaxing music

1216
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,960
Just a song

1217
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,960
Okay?

1218
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,240
Let's go

1219
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,720
Let me tell you

1220
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,720
The test is not painful at all

1221
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,720
You just need to calm down

1222
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,160
and finish the song

1223
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,120
Not bad

1224
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,520
All the indicators of your body

1225
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,640
are good

1226
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,800
You're good at it

1227
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,040
I'm good at it

1228
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,120
All the indicators of your body

1229
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,480
are stable

1230
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,480
It seems that your family

1231
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,600
takes good care of you

1232
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,400
Baikun has a good appetite recently

1233
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,000
He drank a big bowl of

1234
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,120
spare ribs soup yesterday

1235
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,400
Thank you, Dr. Zhang

1236
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,640
Thank you for coming today

1237
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,520
It's okay

1238
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,360
It's my duty

1239
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,480
Mr. Shi

1240
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,640
Let's keep going, okay?

1241
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,360
Okay

1242
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,800
Okay, I'll go back to work

1243
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,720
I'll come to see you in the afternoon

1244
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,600
Thank you

1245
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,400
Thank you

1246
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,440
You

1247
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,960
You should be more strict with me

1248
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,920
It's cold

1249
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,040
Don't catch a cold

1250
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,800
Come on, hold my hand

1251
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,000
This

1252
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,680
This is too much

1253
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,120
We just used this

1254
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,360
in the beginning of the month

1255
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,360
Okay, okay, okay

1256
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,120
I'll rub your hands

1257
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,120
Come on

1258
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,440
Rub your hands

1259
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,480
Rub it to make it comfortable

1260
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,280
We have to keep playing tomorrow

1261
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,320
It won't be cold

1262
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,320
Okay

1263
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,320
Okay

1264
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,320
I'll stop talking

1265
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,600
I checked it, aunt

1266
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,200
There's nothing wrong

1267
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,200
Don't worry

1268
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,360
Thank you, Dr. Xiao

1269
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:58,640
It's okay

1270
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,560
Thank you

1271
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,600
Anyway, I told you

1272
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:19,480
about the problem of the

1273
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,760
By the way

1274
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,280
Is the vending machine

1275
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,640
on the second floor?

1276
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,080
Both the first and second floors

1277
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,840
The first floor?

1278
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:49,240
In the middle of the stairs and the

1279
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,360
Okay

1280
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:57,800
Dr. Sui, let's go

1281
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,400
Dr. Sui, how about I help you?

1282
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,280
You changed your clothes

1283
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,520
before coming to me

1284
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,560
I'll go first

1285
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,560
Hurry up

1286
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,000
Bye

1287
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,560
You're so good

1288
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,280
Dr. Xiao, bye

1289
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,240
Okay

1290
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,240
Bye

1291
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,960
You're still here

1292
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,760
Haven't you left?

1293
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,720
I'm going now

1294
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,400
Great

1295
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,720
Let's have a meal

1296
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,720
It's not cold today

1297
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,800
I asked my mom

1298
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,080
How about tomorrow?

1299
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,480
I'll give you the materials

1300
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,960
You forgot Mac ion?

1301
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,880
How about the day after tomorrow?

1302
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,840
Or the day after?

1303
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,760
Anyway, we will have meals

1304
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,520
whenever you are free

1305
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,520
OK, we can eat

1306
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,560
your favorite

1307
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,160
You know

1308
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,320
what I like the most

1309
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,320
You told me last time that you forgot about it

1310
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,320
What's wrong with you?

1311
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,320
Dr. Xiao

1312
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
What's wrong with Dr. Guan?

1313
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
This suit looks good

1314
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,320
It's custom made

1315
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,320
Thank you

1316
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,320
Custom made? I have an academic exchange

1317
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,320
How about this? Push the store to me

1318
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,320
I'll go buy one

1319
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,320
Doctor, it's settled. Tomorrow, let's have dinner

1320
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,320
Remember to bring the medicine

1321
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,320
How do you measure this?

1322
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,320
Should I measure the shoulder, waist or something?

1323
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,320
Okay

1324
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,320
Thank you, Dr. Zhang

1325
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,320
See you

1326
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,320
What are you doing?

1327
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,320
You're not going home after work

1328
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,320
I'm just looking at Xiao Han

1329
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,320
Don't go

1330
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,320
Tell me

1331
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,320
What's going on with Xiao Han?

1332
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,320
It's written on it

1333
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,320
I don't want to know about him

1334
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,320
I just want to know

1335
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,320
what's going on between him and the director

1336
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,320
Director Zhou?

1337
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,320
Director Yu

1338
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,320
You want to know?

1339
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,320
Call me brother

1340
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,320
Brother

1341
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,320
Wait here, I'll change my clothes

1342
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,320
Hurry up

1343
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,320
Hurry up

1344
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,320
Don't do that

1345
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,320
You're like me

1346
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,320
Tell me

1347
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,320
What's going on between Director Yu and Xiao Han?

1348
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,320
They knew each other when they were in college

1349
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,320
They couldn't even fight when they were in work

1350
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,320
They were always fighting

1351
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,320
Until last year, he came to the center

1352
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,320
I found he was a little sad about Director Yu

1353
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,320
But no

1354
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,320
Director Yu will never like him

1355
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
I'm confident about that

1356
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,320
That's right

1357
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,320
Who do you think will win

1358
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,320
You, of course

1359
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,320
You're my brother

1360
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,320
I let you compare us

1361
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,320
It's none of your business

1362
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,320
You can judge his advantages

1363
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
He's mature and stable

1364
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,320
He's a little better

1365
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
He's mature and stable

1366
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,320
I'm young and full of energy

1367
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,320
Look at his hair

1368
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,320
He sprays so much hair oil every day

1369
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,320
His hair can't fall down

1370
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,320
It's greasy

1371
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,320
It's dirty

1372
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,320
Okay

1373
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,320
Let's not talk behind his back

1374
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,320
Okay?

1375
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,320
I can't

1376
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,320
Not behind his back

1377
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,320
Dr. Zhao

1378
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,320
Have some popcorn

1379
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,320
You eat it, I'll treat you

1380
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,320
Thank you, I don't eat snacks

1381
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,320
Only kids can eat this

1382
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,320
Are you happy today?

1383
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,320
I'm in a good mood every day

1384
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,320
Boss, I'm going

1385
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,320
Dong Cheng, I didn't say that

1386
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,320
You said you had nothing to do that night

1387
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
You came to eat and drink

1388
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
You made a living

1389
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,320
I envy you

1390
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
You only know how to give medicine to others

1391
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,320
How can you forget to treat and save people

1392
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,320
You're almost 40

1393
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,320
Can you be more attractive

1394
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,320
You're too old

1395
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,320
to go out and fight

1396
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,320
You're too old to be a man

1397
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,320
Dr. Guan

1398
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,320
If you have any questions, ask me

1399
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,320
Don't learn from him

1400
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,320
Am I like a man who is 40?

1401
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,320
No

1402
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,320
He's like a man who is 40

1403
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,320
Yes, some people

1404
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,320
don't use their mouths to give medicine to people who need it

1405
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,320
You're so hesitating

1406
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,320
Who is it?

1407
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,320
Xiao Xu

1408
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,320
Why are you here?

1409
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,320
I'm here to ask Director Yu some questions

1410
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,320
Come in

1411
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,320
Yushi

1412
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,320
Who is it?

1413
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,320
I'll talk to you

1414
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,320
Director, I was reading at my house

1415
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,320
But my brother is not in a good mood

1416
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,320
I asked him a few questions

1417
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,320
He's not annoying

1418
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,320
Liu Jing is on duty today, he's not at home

1419
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,320
I can't go to Yiyi's house

1420
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,320
So I came to your house

1421
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,320
I came to your house

1422
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,320
You can supervise me

1423
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,320
I can ask you in time

1424
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,320
Zhao Dongcheng is not annoying to you

1425
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,320
Come in

1426
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,320
Director

1427
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,320
I'm sorry

1428
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,320
I'm sorry
