1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,740
Honor Your Charles

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,520
In this city, there will always Pl comments around you

3
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,440
Bruh brother, the markets thatia gotI pshhuhed ws dead by net

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,240
So nobody gets scared of bad views

5
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,760
No one should feel coy

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,600
Hear 강的 Sin

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,680
Whos that i shame

8
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,080
The man you can trust

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,760
You must knock first

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,080
After hearing your report

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,160
Fall next in line

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,960
phone call

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,240
Forced to be角

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,960
Who opened the door of the hospital

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,360
The ugly and beautiful aunt

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,720
Or the little ghost of the neighbor

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,520
I'm here, don't worry, he's talking

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,440
Open your mouth

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,200
My house is like a bread and beer

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,240
Like the river

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,600
The big river that is in danger

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,120
There is also a big leaf with a white head

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,320
Don't be too harsh

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,800
Don't be too stubborn

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,200
Little Chi has your alcohol

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,560
The name can be solved

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,640
I haven't heard the song

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,440
Don't open your mouth and say ah yeah

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,800
The night is like a time machine

30
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,880
The good medicine is on

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,600
Kneel down and look at the expression

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
What is this?

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,920
Call a friend

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,280
Set a location and immediately go

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,640
Hurry up and hurry up

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,000
There is still a new disease tomorrow

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,240
I walked from the end of the orange to the end of the plum

38
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,480
West Coast Maniz

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,440
Drink such a warm and sweet wine and green onion in winter

40
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,000
Is it delicious?

41
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,680
You drink the wine

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,320
Did you go to the doctor?

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,480
How about it?

44
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,680
Zhao Deng Chow told you to ask me

45
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,360
In this situation

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,160
I asked myself

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
Sorry, what's wrong with this?

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
You are sick

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,920
Everyone is ill

50
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,840
Liquid Avec me the doctor

51
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,120
Vera will take it slowly

52
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,420
If you need some company

53
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,260
You can call me

54
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,180
I'll come and go

55
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,380
You can come to my house for dinner

56
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,580
without Zhao Dongcheng

57
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,660
I did rely on him too much

58
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,460
It's not a normal relationship

59
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,020
So I decided to face some problems myself

60
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,500
I went to see the doctor

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,380
Nothing serious

62
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,180
I can adjust

63
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,900
Good

64
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,460
Don't think too much

65
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,940
Don't be like Zhao

66
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,660
You can't finish your work every day

67
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,500
Yes

68
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,340
If he were here

69
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,020
you would be worried about this

70
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,900
and that

71
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,660
and that

72
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,940
It's endless

73
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,220
But last time

74
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,980
I didn't hold back my emotions

75
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,060
I said a few words to him

76
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,660
and I even asked him to...

77
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,780
Well said

78
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,780
He deserves to be said

79
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,580
He's like Tang Seng

80
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,940
nagging all the time

81
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,180
It's endless

82
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,660
Don't say that

83
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,900
I want to beat him

84
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,700
No need

85
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,180
Don't worry

86
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,540
I won't

87
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,100
I've been with him since we were kids

88
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,740
We're very close

89
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,780
Pei Yao

90
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,540
You just finished your medicine

91
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,660
Why are you here again?

92
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,140
You're about to be discharged

93
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,780
Give me more medicine

94
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,860
There's still some time

95
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,980
You can't keep it forever

96
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,660
We have rules

97
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,300
You can't make me get sued

98
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,180
I've been here every two weeks

99
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,300
I'm used to it

100
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,820
I'm not feeling well now

101
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,540
My house is within the range of the border

102
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,140
It's in the community of Shi Daoshi

103
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,020
Come back in two weeks, okay?

104
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,500
Okay

105
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,620
See you

106
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,620
Wang Yijian

107
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,940
Dr. Zhao

108
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,020
Your friend came here

109
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,060
How is he?

110
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,660
You're right

111
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,740
He has difficulty breathing

112
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,100
He's in a bad mood

113
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,100
It's because of psychological problems

114
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,140
According to the initial assessment

115
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,020
it's probably a long-term cancer

116
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,940
or a severe cancer

117
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,860
He's not well

118
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,380
It's hard to make a decision now

119
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,460
Is it because of his family's death?

120
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,460
His grandfather's death

121
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,580
has inspired him to

122
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,980
think about his parents and family

123
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,260
and all the bad things

124
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,940
He will keep

125
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,060
increasing his anxiety

126
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,660
and fear of being abandoned again

127
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,500
He's always in a state

128
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,140
of panic and anxiety

129
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,980
But the good news is that he's very strong

130
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,260
He has

131
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,580
the desire to adjust himself

132
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,900
We suggest he change the environment

133
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,140
and adjust himself slowly

134
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,740
Yijian, I think you should go to Hefei Hospital

135
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,940
I heard that the director of the slow-moving science department

136
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,620
is good-tempered and slow-tempered

137
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,700
You're the only one

138
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,780
who's been trained to be a tree-lion

139
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,580
I'm not a hasty person

140
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,860
I'm not a hasty person

141
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,540
I think you're the tree-lion

142
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,940
You only have six patients a day

143
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,340
No wonder you're called Liu Jin

144
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,780
I have to treat every patient seriously

145
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,060
Patients are like family

146
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,860
You know that?

147
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,620
Are you as close to Wang Kankan as your family?

148
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,820
Is that so?

149
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,820
Have you made up your mind?

150
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,660
Where are you going?

151
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,420
Not yet

152
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,820
Since the hospital

153
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,700
released a male nurse

154
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,220
Zhou Liancheng's phone has never been disconnected

155
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,500
Have you decided which three-finger?

156
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,780
You're my baby wherever you go

157
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,220
I didn't say I had to go to the three-finger

158
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,420
OK, you're ambitious

159
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,580
Remember, brother

160
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,060
no matter what conditions others give you

161
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,100
don't be so easy

162
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,940
Come back and tell me

163
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,420
I'll help you get a good restaurant

164
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,100
Don't be so selfish

165
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,420
Am I being selfish?

166
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,300
I'm sharing my precious life experience

167
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,020
You don't have any experience to share

168
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,700
What about you, Yuzhi?

169
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,220
You're the director

170
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,580
You're a radish and a pit

171
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,980
It's not easy to find a big pit

172
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,860
Director Cheng found me a big pit in Shenzhen

173
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,140
He asked me to study in Jinxiu

174
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,220
and then go back to the base

175
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,140
Have you made up your mind?

176
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,620
Are you going?

177
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,260
I haven't decided yet

178
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,780
It's only a year and a half

179
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,300
If I leave

180
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,700
what about my old boss?

181
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,380
My sister is not reliable

182
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,460
It's good to stay in Xincheng

183
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,700
Have you made up your mind, Jun?

184
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,300
Or I can help you choose

185
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,420
Yiyi is going to school

186
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,580
I can help you choose a hospital

187
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,340
with good schools around

188
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,300
I want to go back

189
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
Anyway, Yiyi has already known

190
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,780
about Suye

191
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,020
We can go back to

192
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,820
live and work there

193
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,620
Our old man is there

194
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,620
They can take care of the two of us

195
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,180
You don't tell me

196
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,380
What about me?

197
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,420
You have a good idea, Jun

198
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,060
Right?

199
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,780
Where are you, Zhao?

200
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,100
Have you made up your mind?

201
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,340
No

202
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,220
Think about it

203
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,100
You are an adult

204
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,660
You can go wherever I go

205
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,580
It's important

206
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,260
What's wrong?

207
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,020
How are you and Xu Jinxia?

208
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,580
I feel like

209
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,020
we are not in time

210
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,900
We are short of something

211
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,220
Mr. Shi just passed away

212
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,300
My family is in danger

213
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,660
because of the house

214
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,300
Right

215
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,860
It's natural

216
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,220
I haven't contacted him

217
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,260
for a while

218
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,580
He may have said something

219
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,740
that was not right

220
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,820
and had some problems

221
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,700
I introduced him to a psychologist

222
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,900
He doesn't want me to be with him

223
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,140
I think if you have time

224
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,180
you can go to see him for me

225
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,660
No problem

226
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,140
I'll talk to him

227
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,100
Tell me if he has any problems

228
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,060
Don't worry

229
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,660
He will be fine

230
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,260
Come on

231
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,060
Don't be shy

232
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,940
You are the boss

233
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,700
I'll help you

234
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,420
Come on

235
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,820
You three live together

236
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,140
If you don't want to lose money

237
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,540
in the household

238
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,300
you can get a house

239
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,340
It's a little far from here

240
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,740
You are so smart

241
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,060
You know it so well

242
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,300
I'm not that smart

243
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,380
I just have some experience

244
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:00,980
Xiaosa

245
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,420
I have some friends to talk to you

246
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,500
Welcome

247
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,700
You can ask me anything

248
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,660
OK

249
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,260
Mom

250
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,140
Go to sleep

251
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,220
I have something to tell you

252
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,220
Sorry

253
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,300
My son has something to tell you

254
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,380
You can talk to him

255
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,340
I have something to tell you

256
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,020
Wait a minute

257
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,860
OK

258
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,380
Come on

259
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,980
OK

260
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,060
Mom, eat

261
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,980
OK

262
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,260
Zhao

263
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,100
It's simple

264
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,220
You can ask the

265
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,580
housing management center

266
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,620
in the district

267
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,340
OK

268
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,740
What about Sister Qin?

269
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,660
What's the matter?

270
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,260
Mom, you know

271
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,300
the hospital has to be demolished

272
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,260
I don't know where to go

273
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,620
They have been saying

274
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,260
this hospital is good

275
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,860
and the department is good

276
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,780
You know

277
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Master Yu, Brother Jun

278
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,860
and Guan Xu

279
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,780
they have plans in the future

280
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,140
I asked Zhao many times

281
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,060
but he hasn't given me any news

282
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,540
I don't know

283
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,180
what to do

284
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,420
Why don't you help me?

285
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,820
You can't leave me alone

286
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,220
My son

287
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,860
You are over 30

288
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,740
You are not three years old

289
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,060
You still don't know

290
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,380
what you are doing

291
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,420
You still have to

292
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,300
decide by your mother

293
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,100
I am not your leader

294
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,420
nor your director

295
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,580
I don't know either

296
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,340
It's none of your business

297
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,900
You can go to the jail

298
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,820
You are still talking

299
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,860
Come on, come on

300
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,860
Come on, come on

301
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,860
If you have any questions

302
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,780
just ask me

303
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,620
Come on, come on

304
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,260
Come on, come on

305
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,580
Qin, please

306
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,060
You can talk

307
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,540
What are you

308
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,780
doing in the morning?

309
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,180
You are going to

310
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,580
the meeting of the company

311
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,300
Why are you so busy?

312
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,820
What do you mean?

313
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,020
We don't have a meeting

314
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,660
You are going to the meeting

315
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,940
for minutes

316
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,300
Why are you so anxious?

317
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,700
I am buying food

318
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,660
If you want to eat something

319
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,300
just tell me

320
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,900
I will come down and buy it

321
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,020
I have to run away

322
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,180
You are the one who buys food

323
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,180
You just take some food

324
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,460
and put it in the bag

325
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,580
You are the one who likes

326
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,660
to buy food

327
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,420
I am sorry

328
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,340
Well, your hospital

329
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,460
is going to be demolished, right?

330
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,700
Have you thought about

331
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,100
which community hospital to go?

332
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,380
No

333
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,860
I have discussed with

334
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,380
Mrs. Liu

335
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,540
After the demolition

336
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,660
is finished

337
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,780
I will go to the resort

338
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,940
with them

339
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,220
for a while

340
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,540
Thirty-six yuan in total

341
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,500
Okay

342
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,260
After that

343
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,140
we can have a little fun

344
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,220
and help her to bring up her child

345
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,980
You should think about

346
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,620
your own business

347
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,100
Don't blame me in the end

348
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,940
How dare I blame you, old princess?

349
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,540
Here, your fish is ready

350
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,300
Okay, thank you

351
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,180
Thank you

352
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,980
See you

353
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,500
The news is quite clear

354
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,020
I went to find Mrs. Liu

355
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,420
in the morning

356
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,340
Why do I have

357
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,660
a daughter like you?

358
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,340
How to eat this fish?

359
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,580
You said you would make fish soup, right?

360
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,420
Let's have steamed fish

361
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,020
Steamed fish is nutritious

362
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,300
Why do you ask me

363
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,940
when you decide to do so?

364
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,660
Have you seen my white T-shirt?

365
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,220
Is it mixed with yours?

366
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,300
I don't know

367
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,940
Who knows where you put it?

368
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,980
Lend me a piece of T-shirt

369
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,380
Take the wardrobe yourself

370
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,620
It's almost the third month

371
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,300
Have you filled the grid?

372
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,980
I want to go out

373
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,420
Where?

374
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
I won't tell you

375
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,460
If you don't tell me

376
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,380
I will know you are going to the third month

377
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,620
Okay

378
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,420
Aunt

379
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,340
Sister, I'm back

380
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,180
I'm back

381
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,980
Have you learned how to ride a bike?

382
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,420
You want to learn this?

383
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,180
What if I can't ride it in the future?

384
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,180
I went to the third month

385
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,220
The nurse there

386
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,540
took me to the acupuncture center

387
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,260
She said I could work there

388
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,700
and prepare for the exam

389
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,260
I can go back to the base level

390
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,820
The hospital will train me

391
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,700
And I can live in the hospital with my tuition

392
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,700
It's good

393
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,740
The acupuncture center in the third month

394
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,500
is the largest in the city

395
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,380
And acupuncture

396
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,260
is very demanding for nurses

397
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,060
One acupuncture

398
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,540
needs about ten acupuncture shots

399
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,460
So it does need

400
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,660
a good nurse

401
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,460
But I haven't decided yet

402
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,020
After all, I can't put it here

403
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,180
It's good here

404
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,340
But the hospital

405
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,980
has its own value

406
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,380
Although the third month

407
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,860
is very demanding

408
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,180
I have many opportunities

409
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,820
to learn

410
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,900
Why do you choose to stay here?

411
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,740
I gave up the hospital

412
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,740
But I don't regret it

413
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,220
Because I have tried it

414
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,340
So if I were you

415
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,620
I would try it first

416
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,820
Then I would see

417
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,740
what kind of life I want

418
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,580
I think so, too

419
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,140
You have the answer in your heart

420
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,980
Not really

421
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,060
I really want to ask you

422
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,940
After all, it's related to my future

423
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,620
What about you?

424
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,940
Are you sure about going to Shenzhen?

425
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,620
Or have you told your aunt?

426
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,820
What's her attitude?

427
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,260
Actually, I have seen

428
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,060
the study project

429
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,500
We are the same

430
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
We are all from the nursing

431
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,700
If you want to continue

432
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,380
in the nursing department

433
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,260
the study project

434
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,380
is quite meaningful

435
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,420
I know you can't

436
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,700
let aunt go

437
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,900
But it doesn't matter

438
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,620
I'm still here

439
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,020
And Zhao Dongcheng

440
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,340
Liu Jing, Jun

441
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,620
We are all here

442
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,620
As long as aunt needs

443
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,180
we can come and go

444
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,620
You can go

445
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,140
If you want to stay

446
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,340
I'm willing to work hard

447
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,140
until the end

448
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,620
Don't think that

449
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,060
being considerate

450
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,220
and thrifty

451
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,420
are the same

452
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,580
As long as the kids

453
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,020
get together

454
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
I should give them some confidence

455
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,300
Is that too hard?

456
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,040
You don't need to

457
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,340
But now

458
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,660
I hope that

459
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,740
I can racing after her

460
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,460
But you're typical

461
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,260
but not allowed to make people your girlfriend

462
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,660
And you protection

463
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,340
Are you having things on your face?

464
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,540
If you'd made revisions

465
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,300
just do it

466
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,260
Anyway

467
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,360
I'm support you

468
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,760
And you said

469
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,360
don't cherish time

470
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,740
Make the time test me

471
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,000
Anyway

472
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,660
if we stay together every day

473
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,660
I feel good when I see you. I don't hate you

474
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,660
You don't hate me? Then you like me

475
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,660
How did you come to this conclusion?

476
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,660
I'm just saying my feelings

477
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,660
I'm just saying my feelings

478
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,660
Your feelings?

479
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,660
Your feelings is that you like me, right?

480
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,660
Then...

481
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,660
Let's try it

482
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,660
Try what?

483
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,660
Try how long this feeling can last

484
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,660
Is this right?

485
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Yes

486
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,660
I'm sorry

487
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,660
I'm sorry

488
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,660
I'm sorry

489
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,660
I'm sorry

490
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
I'm sorry

491
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,660
Hello, I'm in bad mood

492
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,660
I didn't say that

493
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,660
I'm in bad mood

494
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,660
Some words except for you

495
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,660
I don't know who to tell

496
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,660
Let's change the hospital

497
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,660
What's the big burden?

498
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,660
If you don't believe me, change it

499
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,660
You know, I've been following you

500
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,580
I've been following you and Master Yu

501
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,900
since I was a freshman.

502
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,140
I don't know

503
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,620
if I like this job.

504
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,940
I only do one thing

505
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,020
after I graduate.

506
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,820
I'm over thirty.

507
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,780
I don't know what I want to do.

508
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,340
I don't know what I like.

509
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,620
Let alone

510
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,700
my dreams and goals.

511
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,500
I think my mom is right.

512
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,260
At this age,

513
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,060
it's not about getting a family and a career.

514
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,180
It's about having a career.

515
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,100
I'm still living like a child.

516
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,700
I'm so confused.

517
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,500
I don't know anything.

518
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,780
Then ask her.

519
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,460
Ask your mom.

520
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,620
What's her dream?

521
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,620
Your family's dream

522
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,460
is to have you

523
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,180
happy and happy every day.

524
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,220
Then they'll be satisfied.

525
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,100
Right?

526
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,260
So when you were in high school,

527
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,620
what was her goal?

528
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,420
A netball athlete.

529
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,100
So

530
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,460
there's always a difference between a goal and a life.

531
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,220
But we didn't give up on life for it.

532
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,500
Most people are like that.

533
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,260
You're not wrong.

534
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,860
What's wrong?

535
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,020
I think you're happy

536
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,540
when you give

537
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,660
Qingchang Lishui

538
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,340
those grandpas, grandmas,

539
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,060
and massages every day.

540
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,580
Maybe that's your love.

541
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,540
But you're too close to her.

542
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,380
You didn't notice it.

543
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,940
But Bizi

544
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,580
hasいa huge potential.

545
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,180
He's the same as you.

546
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,340
If he takes you to the chance,

547
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,020
then your future will be good, too.

548
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,860
Hey,

549
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,740
stop playfully're strong.

550
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,780
Don't have feelings heartения.

551
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,700
It's not so important.

552
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,420
They're all important.

553
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,780
Zhao.

554
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,020
After the house's demolished,

555
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,020
I told him.

556
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,820
Then we found an economical

557
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,020
and convenient place.

558
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,420
We moved in and lived together.

559
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,420
It's best to live with these old neighbors.

560
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
That's how it worked.

561
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,820
I asked Master Yu's thoughts.

562
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,220
Then there was Auntie Qin's thoughts.

563
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,020
Speaking of which, I remembered.

564
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,420
This afternoon, when I passed by

565
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,020
the hair salon in our community,

566
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,420
I saw that they were also collecting the money.

567
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,420
In high school,

568
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,420
do you remember Master Yu

569
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,220
chasing after us crazily for a while?

570
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,020
Yes.

571
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,420
At that time, he insisted on taking us

572
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
to that hair salon.

573
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,620
He was so rich.

574
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,420
I remember the terrible hairstyle.

575
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,820
I remember that Samart.

576
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,620
I was so shocked.

577
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,220
He forced us to take a big photo.

578
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:35,820
Yes.

579
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,820
He drew a face mask.

580
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,420
Yes.

581
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,620
He had ears.

582
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,020
He was so hot.

583
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,020
He forced us to take a photo of the park.

584
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,020
Yes.

585
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,620
It's more than 30 years old.

586
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,620
Yes.

587
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,420
Time flies.

588
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,820
I'm not like a 30-year-old doll.

589
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,620
I'm not like a 30-year-old doll.

590
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,420
Why am I like a 30-year-old doll?

591
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,020
I'm not like a 30-year-old doll.

592
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,220
I'm not like a 30-year-old doll.

593
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,020
Dad, hurry up.

594
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,420
Wait for me.

595
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,420
Dad, hurry up.

596
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,020
Dad, wait for me.

597
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,620
Hurry up, hurry up.

598
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,420
Don't worry, Dad.

599
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,020
I have a skirt that I stepped on.

600
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,820
Dad, Dad, hurry up.

601
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
Stand here, I'll take a picture for you

602
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,820
I'll take a picture for you

603
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
I don't take a picture

604
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,820
Chen Sa

605
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,820
I'll stand there

606
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,820
OK

607
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,820
Is it OK? Is it OK here?

608
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,820
Smile, happy

609
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,820
Look at the camera

610
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,820
Happy

611
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,820
Smile, daddy

612
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,820
Daddy

613
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,820
OK, come on, take a picture

614
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,820
Daddy

615
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,820
Take a picture

616
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,820
Come on

617
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,820
OK

618
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,820
Is it OK? Look

619
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,820
It's so beautiful

620
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,820
Are you satisfied? Yes

621
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,820
Are you happy? Yes, very happy

622
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,820
You lied to me again

623
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,820
What's wrong, baby?

624
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,820
I didn't lie to you

625
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,820
I let you wear these clothes

626
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,820
Just for you to accept the punishment

627
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,820
I didn't lie to you

628
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,820
Teacher Xu Xia punished me

629
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,820
I'm not so happy

630
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,820
Why are you so happy?

631
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,820
Actually, I'm not so happy

632
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,820
I just think

633
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,820
I'm really ugly in this dress

634
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,820
You see, they look at me everywhere

635
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,820
They all laugh at me

636
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,820
Embarrassing

637
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,820
You little bad boy

638
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,820
You're so bad

639
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,820
I know

640
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Baby

641
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,820
Daddy has already accepted your punishment

642
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
I promise you

643
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,820
I won't lie to you again from now on

644
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,820
And you're a big girl

645
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,820
I'll discuss everything with you

646
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,820
OK?

647
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,820
I want to

648
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,820
LaGao

649
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,820
LaGao, change the name

650
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,820
Change the name

651
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Zhang Jun

652
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,820
Fu Ying

653
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Don't lie to me again

654
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,820
I have evidence

655
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,820
OK

656
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,820
Now I have something to discuss with you

657
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,820
What?

658
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,820
I want to take you away from here

659
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,820
Where?

660
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
Brother Yi Sang will go?

661
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,820
He won't go

662
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,820
Only the two of us

663
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,820
Let's go to grandparents

664
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,820
Because when dad goes to work

665
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,820
Grandparents can take care of you

666
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,820
And they're old

667
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,820
We can take care of them

668
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,820
Of course this is just dad's decision

669
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,820
You can consider

670
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,820
If you disagree

671
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,820
Then we won't go

672
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,820
OK

673
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,820
I'll consider

674
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,820
OK

675
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,820
I'll go

676
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,820
Friends

677
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,820
I finally decide which hospital to go

678
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,820
How about it?

679
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,820
Are you curious?

680
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,820
I know you're all curious and looking forward to it

681
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,820
The answer will be announced soon

682
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,820
I wrote all the selected hospitals

683
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,820
Four papers

684
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,820
You each vote one

685
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,820
Which hospital has a high vote

686
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,820
I'll go to which one

687
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,820
Am I smart?

688
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
Yes, you are

689
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,820
Since I don't know what to do

690
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,820
I'll leave my fate to fate

691
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,820
Brother Jun, where are you going?

692
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,820
Brother Jun will go back next week

693
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,820
To Xiaohu

694
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,820
I'll go to the school for Yi Yi

695
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,820
Did you decide it?

696
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,820
He decided

697
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,820
To Sanjia Hospital

698
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
Master Yu, aren't you not sure

699
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,820
whether you will go to Shenzhen?

700
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
You can use my method

701
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,820
It's very useful

702
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,820
He decided

703
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
To Shenzhen

704
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Then why am I the last one

705
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,820
who knows?

706
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,820
I'll go to work today

707
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,820
Zhao hasn't decided where to go

708
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,820
Why don't you two talk?

709
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,820
Then you should be careful

710
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,820
of your knees

711
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,820
OK

712
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
By the way, last week

713
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,820
You said your daughter had diarrhea

714
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,820
So you gave her medicine

715
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,820
Is it OK?

716
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,820
Almost

717
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,820
Almost

718
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,820
OK

719
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,820
I'll go back to cook

720
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,820
OK

721
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,820
Bye, bye, bye

722
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,820
See you later

723
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,820
Bye

724
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,820
What are you doing?

725
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,820
I'm looking for a person

726
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,820
Aren't you waiting for me to have dinner?

727
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,820
No

728
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,820
You are still chasing after me

729
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
after you go to work?

730
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,820
We are learning from each other

731
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,820
and improving from each other

732
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,820
You don't understand

733
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,820
Zhao

734
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,820
Let's have dinner together

735
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,820
I can't today

736
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,820
Yi Yi's mother

737
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,820
said there was a lecture

738
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,820
about childhood

739
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,820
I have to go and listen to it

740
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,820
I won't have dinner with you today

741
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
Bye

742
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,820
Bye, Brother Jun

743
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,820
Bye, Brother Jun

744
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,820
What about you?

745
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,820
Let's have dinner together

746
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,820
What?

747
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
A new village

748
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,820
OK, wait for me to change my clothes

749
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,820
Zhao

750
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,820
You have something to do too?

751
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,820
I have something to do too

752
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,820
Let's go

753
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,820
Hurry up

754
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,820
If we both pass the exam

755
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,820
we will become a couple

756
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,820
You won't like to go to other people's school, right?

757
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
I can only say

758
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
if you think so

759
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,820
you will definitely not pass the exam

760
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,820
If you can't pass the exam

761
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,820
it's good

762
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,820
I can support you

763
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,820
You should support yourself first

764
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,820
By the way

765
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,820
I have read your English test

766
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,820
You made a lot of mistakes

767
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,820
You asked me to eat out

768
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,820
and wasted my time on studying

769
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,820
I brought you out

770
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,820
because you were hungry

771
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,820
I was wrong

772
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,820
I was wrong, Director

773
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,820
No

774
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,820
We are in a relationship

775
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
I can't call you

776
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
as the director

777
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,820
I call you Master Yu

778
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,820
But everyone calls you that

779
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,820
Then I call you

780
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,820
Master

781
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,820
Master

782
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,820
or Yu

783
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,820
Yu

784
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,820
Yu

785
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,820
Yu

786
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,820
This is called a relationship

787
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
Your mom

788
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,820
What mom?

789
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,820
Why are you scolding me?

790
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,820
Hello, aunt

791
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,820
Mom

792
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,820
In the daytime

793
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,820
on the street

794
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,820
what are you doing?

795
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,820
I'm not playing

796
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,820
I'm sitting here eating

797
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,820
Aunt

798
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,820
Have some skewers

799
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,820
My mom doesn't eat that

800
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,820
This

801
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,820
I'm sorry

802
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,820
I'm sorry

803
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,820
I can't eat hard food

804
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,820
Then this

805
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,820
It's cold

806
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,820
You eat

807
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,820
I'll get it

808
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,820
No need

809
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,820
No need

810
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,820
I'll get it

811
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,820
I'll get it, aunt

812
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,820
OK, OK, OK

813
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,820
OK, you take it

814
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,820
Aunt, are you thirsty?

815
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,820
I'll get you some water

816
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
No need

817
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,820
No need

818
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,820
It's OK

819
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
You two

820
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,820
You're not young anymore

821
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,820
In the daytime

822
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
In this

823
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
I'm a little thirsty too

824
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,820
Little master, mom

825
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,820
Come out for a walk

826
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,820
No

827
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,820
I have something to do with my friend

828
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,820
That's the master

829
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,820
Are you in love?

830
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,820
This little monkey is pretty handsome

831
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,820
So young

832
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,820
Did you graduate?

833
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,820
That's a brother of Zhao Dongcheng

834
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,820
He especially likes our little master

835
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,820
I've been chasing him all day

836
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,820
I've been chasing him all day

837
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,820
Now he's a man

838
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,820
He's our little master's boyfriend

839
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,820
He's a little younger

840
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,820
But he has a good taste

841
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,820
He likes our little master

842
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,820
At first

843
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,820
Little master didn't agree

844
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,820
Our daughter

845
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,820
Just like people

846
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,820
That's good

847
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
Yes

848
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,820
That's good

849
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,820
Then I'll go in

850
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,820
I'll go in

851
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,820
I'll go in

852
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,820
Aren't you busy at the hospital recently?

853
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,820
I see you're always talking nonsense

854
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,820
I've been talking to people for a long time

855
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
This is to give people

856
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,820
knowledge, health and prosperity

857
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,820
You're lying

858
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,820
You

859
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,820
You

860
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
My waist

861
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,820
You said this shop

862
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
It's been open for hours

863
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,820
This waist is uncomfortable

864
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,820
I told you

865
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,820
Close the door earlier

866
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,820
Don't wait for a long time

867
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,820
Isn't this piece going to be removed?

868
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,820
My shop

869
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,820
Isn't that what everyone is doing?

870
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,820
I can let everyone eat more

871
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,820
I'll eat one more bite

872
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,820
You're right

873
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,820
Look

874
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,820
These shops

875
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
It's almost twelve o'clock

876
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,820
Still not closing

877
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,820
Isn't this place normal?

878
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,820
More and more lively

879
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
Pretty good

880
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,820
Although it's going to be removed

881
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,820
What should be lived still needs to be lived

882
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,820
What should be worked still needs to be worked

883
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,820
Dr. Zhao

884
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,820
You're off work tomorrow

885
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,820
Come early

886
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,820
All I do here

887
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,820
Are all old guests

888
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,820
You can chat with them again

889
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,820
Come on, have a drink

890
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,820
Have a drink

891
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,820
Have a drink

892
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,820
I mean

893
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,820
Still unhappy

894
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,820
No, I'm not unhappy

895
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,820
Then have a drink

896
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,820
By the way

897
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,820
Sister sent you a message

898
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,820
A little star in my heart

899
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,820
In life

900
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,820
It's everywhere

901
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,820
Bright gold

902
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,820
Interesting

903
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,820
Cheers

904
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,820
The taste is very quiet

905
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,820
Everything is soft and quiet

906
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:49,820
Every intersection is open in the sun

907
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:57,820
The shop door sends a nice song

908
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:04,820
No need to walk too long to reach the destination

909
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,820
People come and go, you are full of kindness

910
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,820
Talk a few words

911
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,820
Dongcheng

912
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,820
I heard you're still hesitating

913
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,820
Before I let you come to the Central Hospital

914
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,820
You always find me all kinds of excuses

915
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,820
Dad is sick

916
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,820
Need to be taken care of

917
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,820
Which uncle is not well yet

918
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,820
This hospital is missing

919
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,820
What brother will emerge later

920
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,820
But this time

921
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,820
Don't talk about this hospital

922
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,820
This community surveyed

923
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,820
What are you still hesitating about

924
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,820
This is the last time I tell you this

925
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,820
If you let go of my pigeon again

926
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,820
I will never care about you again

927
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,820
I will never care about you again

928
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,820
This sentence

929
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,820
You have said it a dozen times

930
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,820
You still laugh

931
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,820
Am I so funny

932
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,820
How are you all the people in this hospital

933
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,820
Like this

934
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,820
I'm so angry with you

935
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,820
Dongcheng

936
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,820
I didn't want you

937
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,820
What must you do

938
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,820
I'm just a pity

939
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,820
I feel sorry for you

940
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,820
Do you know

941
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,820
When you were in school before

942
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,820
You were obviously better

943
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,820
Yes

944
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,820
We graduated

945
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,820
Until now

946
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,820
So many years have passed

947
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,820
Think about it

948
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,820
When you were in school

949
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,820
We were competitors

950
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,820
I went to school

951
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,820
Also went to the hospital

952
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,820
I've always wanted to pull me

953
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,820
Thank you

954
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,820
Xiao Han

955
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,820
You still know thank me

956
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,820
OK, I'll listen to you

957
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,820
Why did you do this

958
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,820
I have answered you last time

959
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,820
There is no need to repeat

960
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,820
I'm just curious about one thing

961
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,820
You write a letter of resignation

962
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,820
There are dozens of letters

963
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,820
There are dozens of letters

964
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,820
You always say you want to go

965
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,820
You want to go

966
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,820
Actually I know you won't go at all

967
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,820
Dongcheng

968
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,820
This time is different

969
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,820
The place you are familiar with

970
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,820
Will be demolished soon

971
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,820
Where are you going

972
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,820
Your colleagues

973
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,820
Have found a place to put you

974
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,820
I prefer to stay here

975
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,820
And let you pick up neighbors

976
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
Just stay here

977
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,820
I'll think about it again

978
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,820
OK, think about it

979
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,820
Dr. Xiaoyun

980
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,820
It's time to go to work

981
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,820
Bye

982
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,820
Bye

983
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,820
Dr. Xiao

984
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,820
Did you remember the time wrongly?

985
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,820
No need to be here today

986
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,820
Dr. Guan

987
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,820
You are the only one

988
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,820
Dr. Guan

989
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,820
Mind your own business

990
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,820
I don't want to be a burden

991
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,820
Don't drag the blame

992
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,820
Who is dragging the blame?

993
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,820
Before you came

994
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,820
Zhao Dongcheng has agreed to go to the Central Hospital

995
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,820
He gave up the opportunity again because of you

996
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,820
I had a chance to see his face

997
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:45,300
I am Usui's

998
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,420
Did you say bear's face

999
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,820
Want to avenge your father

1000
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,820
No

1001
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,820
3- fatty

1002
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,820
What a platter

1003
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,740
I don't think so

1004
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,060
Who told you that?

1005
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,820
Xiao Han said he would go to the Central Hospital

1006
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,300
I thought it was Tonghe

1007
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,060
Zhou mentioned Guizhen

1008
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,540
I'm leaving, Miss Chen

1009
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,500
Okay, take care

1010
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
See you next time, Miss Chen

1011
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,380
See you next time

1012
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,860
Dr. Zhao, you look unhappy

1013
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,260
Boss

1014
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,660
Close the door

1015
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,700
Boss, take a bowl and eat it quickly

1016
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,620
No one is calling me

1017
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,460
Sister, give it to them

1018
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,620
I haven't touched it, bro

1019
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,300
Thanks

1020
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:26,900
Okay

1021
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,020
I'll leave you to it

1022
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,980
Thank you

1023
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,700
Boss

1024
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,020
I heard you're going to disband

1025
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,220
You're so lucky

1026
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,940
What lucky?

1027
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,740
I don't know where I'm going to move

1028
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,500
Besides, the neighbors

1029
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,420
have been living here for more than ten years

1030
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,980
They are all very kind

1031
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,140
Now, even relatives are not kind

1032
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,300
What can neighbors be kind to?

1033
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,100
You don't live in this area

1034
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,740
You don't know that

1035
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,820
Now, people should listen to me

1036
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,420
As long as there are benefits

1037
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,740
they can live together

1038
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,700
If there are no benefits

1039
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,740
they will all be disbanded

1040
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,860
You can't say that

1041
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,660
We have schools, hospitals and vegetable markets

1042
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,060
We've been here for decades

1043
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,460
It's very convenient

1044
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,700
Besides

1045
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,540
people need to be educated

1046
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,980
The school is so small

1047
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,140
and your street is so bad

1048
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,300
You can just demolish it

1049
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,820
And that hospital

1050
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,220
is a community hospital

1051
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,620
There are more than one hospitals in this community

1052
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,740
Once it's demolished

1053
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,900
the government will build another hospital for you

1054
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,140
Then you will know

1055
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,100
there is no new hospital

1056
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,180
What did you say?

1057
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,900
What did I say?

1058
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,900
What did you say?

1059
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,100
What did I say?

1060
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,460
Did you say demolish it?

1061
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,420
What's wrong with demolishing it?

1062
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,900
I think this community should be demolished

1063
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,740
Are you hurt?

1064
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,340
Ins Dimension

1065
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,540
All of you, stop

1066
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,220
Stop

1067
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,940
Leave me alone

1068
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,620
Stand still

1069
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,500
What's the matter?

1070
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,260
Go

1071
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,260
Go

1072
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,060
Are you attacked by others?

1073
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,620
I'm sorry

1074
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,620
I'm sorry

1075
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,620
I'm sorry

1076
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,620
I'm sorry

1077
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,620
I'm sorry

1078
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,620
What's wrong?

1079
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,620
I didn't fight with anyone

1080
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,620
I just want to make sense

1081
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,620
Sister Shun, what's going on?

1082
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,620
I didn't fight with anyone

1083
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,620
Just a little bit

1084
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,620
Don't be so stubborn

1085
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,620
Don't ask

1086
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,620
Mei Yi is asleep

1087
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,620
Take her back

1088
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,620
Just tell me

1089
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,620
Why did you fight?

1090
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,620
Is it that hard?

1091
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,620
I didn't fight

1092
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,620
I just drank some wine

1093
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,620
I was in a hurry

1094
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
Sister Shun said

1095
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,620
you had a fight

1096
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,620
Otherwise, how could you do this?

1097
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,620
Can you believe what she said?

1098
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,620
Then you drink alone

1099
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,620
Is there anything wrong?

1100
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,620
What's it to you?

1101
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,620
Go back

1102
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,620
Jun

1103
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,620
I'll go now

1104
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,620
She doesn't want to talk

1105
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,620
Baby

1106
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,620
I'll take her home

1107
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,620
Brother Yisen

1108
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,620
seems to be fine

1109
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,620
I'm leaving

1110
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,620
I'm going back

1111
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,620
Take care

1112
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,620
Lao Zhang

1113
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,620
Which hospital did you go to?

1114
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,620
Where did you go?

1115
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,620
Brother Pei Ting

1116
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,620
Don't ask

1117
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,620
She can't say anything today

1118
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,620
I'm going to sleep

1119
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,620
You go back

1120
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,620
Did you take a bath today?

1121
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,620
I don't care if you wash it or not

1122
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,620
Help me to take the plastic wrap

1123
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,620
and wrap my hands

1124
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,620
Okay, stop eating

1125
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,620
Leave

1126
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,620
You're a bad guy

1127
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,620
I'm going

1128
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,620
You're so bad

1129
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,620
I'm going back

1130
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,620
I bought grandpa's house today

1131
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,620
It's good

1132
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,620
It's sold well

1133
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,620
As long as you enjoy it

1134
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,620
and be low-key

1135
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,620
The money is donated

1136
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,620
to the elementary school in the community

1137
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,620
Grandpa has been teaching here for a lifetime

1138
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,620
He said

1139
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,620
It's a gift for him

1140
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,620
He will be happy

1141
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,620
I shouldn't go back to the original place

1142
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,620
I want to go out and take a walk

1143
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,620
It's good

1144
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,620
Thank you

1145
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,620
For what?

1146
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,620
Thank you for taking care of me

1147
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,620
when I was most sad

1148
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,620
and most in need

1149
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,620
But I still have to learn to live by myself

1150
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,620
We are all

1151
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,620
This is the essential course on the road of growth

1152
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,620
We all have to learn

1153
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,620
not to depend on others

1154
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,620
and live independently

1155
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,620
Eat well and sleep well

1156
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,620
You too

1157
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,620
I'm glad to meet you, Zhao Dengchao

1158
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,620
Let's go

1159
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,620
Let's go

1160
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,620
Me too

1161
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,620
I'm glad to meet you

1162
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,620
Me too

1163
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,620
Me too

1164
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,620
Mom

1165
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,620
Who is knocking?

1166
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,620
Mom, you

1167
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,620
You stupid boy

1168
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,620
You are a bad boy

1169
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,620
You bought a lion

1170
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,620
and let the lion eat you

1171
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,620
You are back

1172
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,620
What's wrong?

1173
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,620
You are back

1174
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,620
I want to eat

1175
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,620
Put it there

1176
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,620
Hot pot

1177
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,620
Hot pot

1178
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,620
It smells good

1179
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,620
You are a bad boy

1180
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,620
You are a bad boy

1181
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,620
You are a bad boy

1182
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,620
You are a bad boy

1183
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,620
Hit me

1184
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,620
Hit me hard

1185
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,620
Are you a bad boy?

1186
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,620
I'm cooking

1187
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,620
What day is it?

1188
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,620
Come on

1189
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,620
Come on

1190
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,620
This is my first time to wear a pair of stockings

1191
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,620
To celebrate my mom's recovery

1192
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,620
I'm out of the sea

1193
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,620
Aunt is back

1194
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,620
OK

1195
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,620
Where is the stocking?

1196
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,620
What day is it?

1197
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,620
You tell me

1198
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,620
Aunt

1199
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:10,620
I got three small red flowers today

1200
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,620
So great

1201
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,620
Three small red flowers

1202
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,620
I have prepared

1203
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,620
The three-month period is here

1204
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,620
I sent you the salary

1205
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,620
I bought you a gift

1206
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,620
It's cheap but meaningful

1207
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,620
You have grown up

1208
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,620
Look

1209
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,020
Women's League zero question alerting

1210
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,860
Teaching

1211
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,620
My deng

1212
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,620
Learn well

1213
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:36,620
You need to learn

1214
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,620
Don't make me

1215
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,620
Revenge for you

1216
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,620
You are a vegetable

1217
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,620
Oh no

1218
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,620
I find that you two

1219
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,620
are getting along

1220
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,620
I envy you

1221
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,620
Let's live together

1222
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,620
I envy you.

1223
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:52,620
I'll go find one too.

1224
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,620
I'll find one younger than you.

1225
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,620
I see you dance with that

1226
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,620
Uncle Liu next door every day.

1227
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,620
Isn't he dancing happily?

1228
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,620
When are we going to meet next time?

1229
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,620
Make your mom happy?

1230
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,620
Being a person

1231
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,620
is the most important thing.

1232
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,620
When I think of Uncle Liu,

1233
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,620
you laugh.

1234
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,620
I can't hide it.

1235
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,620
Enough?

1236
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:13,620
Enough, enough, enough.

1237
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,620
Dad, I think

1238
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,620
that school is not good.

1239
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,620
The dishes don't look good.

1240
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,620
What do you think?

1241
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,620
If you don't think it's good,

1242
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,620
then I'll

1243
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,620
keep the same view as you.

1244
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,620
It's not good.

1245
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,620
Son, I asked around.

1246
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,620
I studied some selected hospitals.

1247
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,620
There are medicine for the kidney,

1248
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,620
for the protruding and protruding,

1249
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,620
for the treatment of the uterus,

1250
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,620
and for any other treatment.

1251
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,620
All of them.

1252
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,620
Tell me,

1253
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:45,620
which one do you want to learn?

1254
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,620
Mom, I've already decided.

1255
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,620
Decided?

1256
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,620
Which one?

1257
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,620
Songting Community Hospital.

1258
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,620
Songting?

1259
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,620
How do you think

1260
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,620
you're going to that one?

1261
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,620
I've already decided.

1262
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,620
Such an important thing.

1263
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,620
You're so smart.

1264
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,620
You're such a smart guy.

1265
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,620
Okay, okay.

1266
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,620
Today is a happy day.

1267
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,620
Mom, I'm going to bed.

1268
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,620
I won't argue with you.

1269
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,620
Come in.

1270
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,620
I have something to tell you.

1271
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,620
Go ahead.

1272
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,620
I wanted to ask you.

1273
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,620
But seeing you like this,

1274
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,620
I've figured it out.

1275
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,620
I just want to ask

1276
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,620
if you're going to

1277
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,620
the three hospitals

1278
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,620
that I don't go to.

1279
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,620
I know.

1280
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,620
It's not because of me.

1281
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,620
And those resignation letters of yours.

1282
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,620
Even if I don't show up,

1283
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,620
you won't send any of them out.

1284
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,620
You can't bear to leave.

1285
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,620
I know.

1286
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,620
It's been three months.

1287
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,620
I almost thought

1288
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,620
I was going to

1289
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,620
quit the hospital.

1290
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,620
What are you thinking?

1291
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,620
Anyway,

1292
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,620
only when you're doing well

1293
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,620
can people around you

1294
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,620
do well.

1295
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,620
Okay.

1296
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,620
Remember.

1297
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,620
Don't nag anymore.

1298
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,620
Look at my words.

1299
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,620
Be selfish.

1300
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,620
Be optimistic.

1301
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,620
Don't have any heart.

1302
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,620
Be happy.

1303
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,620
It's good.

1304
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,620
Come on.

1305
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,620
Let's eat.

1306
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,620
Let's eat.

Let's eat.

Yixing.

1309
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,620
You're so good.

1310
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,620
You're so good.

1311
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,620
Let's eat.

1312
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,620
Here it comes.

Come on.

Let's eat.

I'm here to eat.

00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,620
Cheers.

00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,620
Okay. Cheers.

00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,620
I wish you a happy happy life.

1350
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,620
This is looked now

1351
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,620
the third and fourth floor.

1352
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,620
Three and four.

1353
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,620
Well,

1354
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,620
Mr.bury,

1355
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,620
I have a lot to tell you.

1356
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,620
Just two more作 closed today.

1357
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,620
Mr. Yang.

1358
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,620
Three and four closed.

1359
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,620
From now,

1360
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,620
I'm not closed.

1361
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,620
I'm not,

1362
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,260
I'm a little bit clumsy

1363
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,060
and do some odd jobs

1364
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,540
that are not eye-catching

1365
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,900
but are always controversial

1366
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,500
I live in a world

1367
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,460
where I am composed of myself and others

1368
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,020
I want to get rid of the reputation of being evaluated

1369
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,500
but also be moved by some small recognition

1370
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,300
We learned to accept

1371
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,500
that everyone is just an ordinary person

1372
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,500
Uncle, what can I do for you?

1373
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,900
I'm looking for Dr. Yu

1374
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,740
Director Yu, someone is looking for you

1375
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,140
Wait a moment, sorry

1376
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,300
Hello, this is

1377
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,580
Dr. Yu, hello

1378
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,580
I'm Gu Jia Bao from Xing Yue community

1379
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,740
Your physical examination report is out

1380
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,260
When will you come to get it?

1381
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:00,700
I don't have time

1382
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,660
Here's the thing

1383
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,540
We saw that you have a few bad indicators

1384
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,500
So we suggest you

1385
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,260
to take a closer look

1386
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:09,740
There are still questions

1387
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,020
about your family

1388
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,820
A week ago

1389
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,020
my brother died of

1390
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,820
a stroke

1391
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,500
I went to the hospital for a checkup

1392
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,820
and found the tumor in the intestine

1393
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,540
If I had listened to your warning

1394
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,340
I would have...

1395
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,540
I would have...

1396
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,740
Dr. Yu, I want to apologize to you

1397
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,140
You are a good doctor

1398
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,900
It's nothing

1399
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,100
If you find any problem, go to the hospital

1400
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,100
It will be fine

1401
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,900
I'll make a call

1402
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:46,580
Go on

1403
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,340
Dr. Zhang

1404
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,180
Why are you here?

1405
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,660
I'm here to do a daily checkup for my mother-in-law

1406
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:05,660
How is she?

1407
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,580
Are they all fine?

1408
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:07,580
Yes

1409
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,580
They are all fine

1410
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,140
Although she is no longer here

1411
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,900
I have to continue

1412
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,500
Dr. Zhang, thank you

1413
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,620
You should thank yourself

1414
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,740
Thank you

1415
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,180
Okay

1416
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,380
I'll go to my mother-in-law

1417
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:32,580
Bye

1418
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,180
Bye

1419
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,060
Why is it white?

1420
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,500
We can't save the world

1421
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,740
But we can try to help everyone we meet

1422
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,380
The world will smile at us

1423
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,300
Age can't define everything

1424
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,060
We can live purely and kind

1425
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,380
Success is not everyone's happiness

1426
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,860
God will also treat these children who have grown up well

1427
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,580
You Jian

1428
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,340
Professor He of the Central Hospital

1429
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,420
is the honorary director of the rehabilitation department in Songting

1430
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,260
You Jian, congratulations

1431
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,060
You are going to be a great student of rehabilitation

1432
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,300
Even if we can't avoid separation

1433
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,460
The time we used to meet

1434
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,580
has also been engraved in our lives

1435
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,420
So don't feel lonely

1436
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:41,500
Have you done the

1437
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,580
Amygdarum?

1438
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:45,700
No

1439
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:45,900
Oh

1440
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,260
I will

1441
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,540
Take care

1442
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,900
Okay

1443
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,180
Thanks

1444
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:02,460
There is a wind blowing gently on my face

1445
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,380
There is

1446
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,140
There will be a day

1447
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,540
We will

1448
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,260
Thank you for all the encounters

1449
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,060
Thank you for all the farewells

1450
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:13,980
Thank you

1451
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,140
Become in this ordinary daily life

1452
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,340
We who stick to this every day

1453
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:28,860
I'm sorry

1454
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,020
Zhao

1455
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,060
Don't kick my head

1456
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,340
My head is sticky

1457
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:41,740
Brother Xun

1458
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,980
Take all the headscarves this time

1459
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,860
Yiyi kept so many headscarves at my home

1460
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,100
I tell you

1461
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,260
You said you bought her headscarves every day

1462
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,740
Then I always feel I can't find it

1463
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,100
Do you remember this set

1464
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,860
Yiyi's family's little bunny

1465
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,100
You bought it for her when you first braided her hair

1466
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,060
I will take her back

1467
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,860
You scared me

1468
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,860
What a dirty thing

1469
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,860
What's in your cabinet?

1470
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,860
It's my Yu's ball

1471
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,860
When did you take it away?

1472
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,860
When did you put it?

1473
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,860
Do you still want this?

1474
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,860
If you want it, I'll clean it for you

1475
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,860
Like new

1476
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,860
Don't you consider giving me one more?

1477
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,860
I'm going to throw up

1478
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,860
You're so annoying

1479
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,860
This is yours

1480
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,860
You can't tell the difference between mine and yours?

1481
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,860
I don't have legs. You can take it

1482
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,860
What's the use of giving me?

1483
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,860
What's this?

1484
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,860
Can you still use it?

1485
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,860
This should be the phone

1486
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,860
that can't receive important messages

1487
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,860
Right, what is this?

1488
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,860
I tell you, this story is so wonderful

1489
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,860
You have to let the three of them

1490
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,860
tell it to you

1491
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,860
Come on, tell your story

1492
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,860
Just say it once

1493
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,860
I thought Lao Zhao liked Master Yu

1494
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,860
Are you crazy? I like him

1495
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,860
I thought you were going to confess to him

1496
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,860
Then why did you ask him to go up the mountain?

1497
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,860
Can I still go?

1498
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,860
I was off work, no, I was off school

1499
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,860
You know, the end of this story

1500
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,860
is that I was alone at the top of the mountain

1501
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,860
and watched the meteorite all night

1502
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,860
If you had come earlier, you could have watched the meteorite with him

1503
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,860
They didn't tell the most wonderful part of the story

1504
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,860
The most wonderful part is that

1505
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,860
since that happened

1506
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,860
they haven't said a word for almost a year

1507
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,860
I feel so embarrassed now

1508
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,860
Lao Zhao, you said you didn't receive the message

1509
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,860
and you didn't tell me

1510
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,860
and you didn't ask me

1511
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,860
I gave you a chance

1512
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,860
I thought you understood what I meant

1513
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,860
Who knows that we have not been

1514
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,860
in touch for so many years

1515
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,860
Your brains

1516
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,860
can be used to cook hot pot

1517
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,860
It's on

1518
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,860
It's so useful

1519
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,860
Don't say that

1520
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,860
I was going to make a fire

1521
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,860
Don't say that

1522
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,860
I was so exhausted to fight against you

1523
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,860
What are you talking about?

1524
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,860
Why do you only know about

1525
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,860
fighting against him? Why don't you care about me?

1526
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:01,860
Boy

1527
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,860
Isn't it good now?

1528
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,860
Everyone is here

1529
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,860
It's good

1530
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,860
I'm going back

1531
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,860
I've almost packed

1532
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,860
Yi Yi is waiting for me at home

1533
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,860
I'm going home too

1534
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,860
I haven't finished packing yet

1535
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,860
I'll pack it when I get home

1536
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,860
You're not going to send her?

1537
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,860
I'll pack my own stuff

1538
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,860
I beg you

1539
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,860
I'm going to send her

1540
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,860
I'm going to send her

1541
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:45,860
I'm going to send her

1542
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,860
I'm going to send her

1543
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,860
I'm begging you to take it away

1544
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,860
No, someone wants to buy me a new one

1545
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,860
Stinky girl

1546
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,860
I'll accompany you

1547
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,860
Okay, I'm leaving too

1548
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,860
Bye

1549
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,860
Bye

1550
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,860
Community Hospital

1551
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:45,860
Decided to rebuild

1552
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,860
Brother, open the door

1553
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,860
Look at your phone

1554
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,860
Another ordinary morning

1555
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,860
Another community hospital

1556
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,860
has started the day

1557
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,860
Although it's not green mountains and green waters

1558
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,860
It's like green mountains and green waters

1559
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,860
It's noisy and busy

1560
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,860
It's a busy day

1561
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:23,860
But it's also indispensable

1562
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,860
In 2022, there are already 2600

1563
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,860
community hospitals around the country

1564
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,860
Graduates from more and more medical schools

1565
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,860
take the initiative to choose community hospitals

1566
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,860
to become the gatekeepers of the grassroots health

1567
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,860
Under the influence of these

1568
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,860
grassroots medical workers

1569
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,860
More and more people

1570
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,860
start to trust and embrace

1571
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,860
the community hospital within one kilometer from home

1572
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,000
The two-way

1573
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
patient treatment system of three hospitals and community hospitals

1574
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
The one-on-one X, family doctor group

1575
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
and the one-on-one cooperation mechanism

1576
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
are constantly being strengthened

1577
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Long-term medical and internet treatment

1578
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Home care services and other service models

1579
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
are constantly optimizing and exploring

1580
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Health is the foundation of a happy life

1581
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And community hospitals

1582
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
are an important foundation

1583
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
to maintain the health of the people

1584
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
The existence of community hospitals

1585
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
has broken through the simple medical scope

1586
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,140
All the workers in the community hospital

1587
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,140
and the residents around them

1588
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,140
jointly established a medical mechanism

1589
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,140
that is like a family

1590
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,140
Let every ordinary person

1591
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,140
enjoy a healthy life

1592
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,140
and a harmonious medical relationship

1593
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,140
They accompany the residents who lost their families

1594
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:31,140
to go out of the dark

1595
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,140
and feel warmth by people who are suffering from illness and pain

1596
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,140
Community hospitals also make more young people

1597
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,140
to take root in the grassroots

1598
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,140
with professional knowledge

1599
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:41,140
and youth and sweat

1600
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:43,140
The Since-Dond Damn Team

1601
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,140
electricity CRT

1602
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:54,160
network

1603
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,160
Hey, I feel a little divinie

1604
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,240
I always think the day seems long

1605
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,240
Hey, I feel a little blank

1606
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,240
I'm afraid the night becomes unsteady

1607
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,240
I'm wearing a white dress

1608
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:20,240
and listening to the heartbeat

1609
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,240
I put love in the blood

1610
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:28,240
and cured the fragile heart

1611
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:33,240
I set out on a dream

1612
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,240
and walked through an unforgettable journey

1613
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:41,240
I was shocked and disappointed

1614
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,240
just to keep my heart going

1615
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:49,240
I set out on a dream

1616
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:53,240
and watched the youth bloom

1617
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:57,240
I was just stubborn

1618
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:02,240
and lit up the bright light of life

1619
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,240
I'm wearing a white dress

1620
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:16,240
and listening to the heartbeat

1621
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,240
I put love in the blood

1622
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:24,240
and cured the fragile heart

1623
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:29,240
I set out on a dream

1624
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,240
and walked through an unforgettable journey

1625
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:37,240
I was shocked and disappointed

1626
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:41,240
just to keep my heart going

1627
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:45,240
I set out on a dream

1628
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:49,240
and watched the youth bloom

1629
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:53,240
I was just stubborn

1630
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:58,240
and lit up the bright light of life

1631
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:11,240
Thanks for watching!
