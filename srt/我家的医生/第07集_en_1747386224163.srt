Do you need help?

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm telling you, you can catch it this time

9
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You want to catch this?

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Come on, go ahead, go ahead

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, no, too much, go back a little bit

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let me see

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Go to the right, to the right

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
To the right

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, no, too much, come back a little bit

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Come back a little bit

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Go back a little bit

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Too much, too much, too much

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I know, auntie, be quiet

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sister, I'm helping you

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You press it, I'll try

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Look, it's just a little bit, just a little bit

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
One more time, one more time

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sure it will work this time

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're here

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't be like this

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't give up so easily

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I tell you, failure is the mother of success

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But it's a success or failure

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Success or failure

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Come on

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Sun Yang

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Come on, baby

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Just this one move, I'll win

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I won

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I won, too

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
How can you three win at the same time?

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're just playing

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Brother, get up

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
My seat, my card

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Brother, get up, my card

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
How did you play in the last game?

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How can three people be together?

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Brother, brother, Master Yu

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Old Song, Brother Jun

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Here, here, I'm here, look at me

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's important, who is it?

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm here, look at me, it's me, me, brother

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Here, here, brother

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Master Yu, Master Yu

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Here, look at me, I'm here, look at me, I'm here

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's okay, dream

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Dream

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
My day is coming again

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Sit down, go

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Dr. Zhang

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Dr. Zhang

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I bought a cup of milk tea

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll give it to you

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
For me?

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Thank you, Xiao Tan

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're welcome

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Dr. Zhang

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I have a question for you

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Go ahead

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Based on your experience of getting married

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
what kind of woman do men like?

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't know men

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you for the milk tea

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Liu Jin, I'll pack you some food

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You've eaten it

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Xiao Tan, you haven't eaten, have you?

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I packed it back, it's hot

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you, Dr. Zhang

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're welcome

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What would you like to drink? I'll treat you

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Sugar-free qipao water

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay, I'll have sugar-free qipao water too

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hurry up, Dr. Shen

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sorry

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sorry

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm sorry

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm sorry

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm sorry

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm sorry

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm sorry

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm sorry

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Dr. Shen wants to treat you

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Director Yu

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're so busy, why are you here?

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I have my own business

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm busy

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I drank so much water that my stomach exploded

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm so angry

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Still no movement

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Still no movement

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Still no movement

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I know you guys are in a hurry to die

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're so annoying

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You dare not to come to me, right?

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Right

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You guys can discuss it in the group

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll give you another night

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If you don't come to me tomorrow

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You'll see

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,900
The

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The Ministry of Health wants a new base report

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The director said

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
he wanted to ask Director Yu to help

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Director Yu

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You should be asked for help

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We're so busy

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Director Yu

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You're a high-class student

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You need to deal with it yourself

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm so sorry

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I can't

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll ask the director to help

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Your work, Director Yu

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,480
I'm so jealous

127
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,880
When can I get off work on time

128
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,160
like Director Yu?

129
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,560
I refuse all my work

130
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,000
with a straight face

131
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,040
Then you should improve your work efficiency

132
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,400
You're so domineering

133
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,320
You're so violent when you're working

134
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,720
You can't finish your work

135
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,200
as fast as you can

136
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,600
Then you should learn from Director Yu

137
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,640
and do more work and talk less

138
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,240
I'm angry

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm so angry

140
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,360
It's the weekend, right?

141
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,760
Yes, tomorrow at six

142
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,880
I think you're so good

143
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,280
You should take good care of yourself

144
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,640
You don't have to

145
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,560
I'll introduce you to others later

146
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,280
It's not the first time

147
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,240
You have a lot of stock

148
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,520
Your feelings are the most important, right?

149
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,760
You added WeChat?

150
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,600
Talk to him first

151
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,240
OK, I'll do it

152
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,680
OK, Uncle Yang

153
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,160
We'll meet in the afternoon

154
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,760
at Fengfan Square

155
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't worry

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,080
I can do it by myself

157
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,280
Bye

158
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,560
You're taking Uncle Yang to Fengfan Square?

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
Did you tell Zhao Dongcheng about it?

160
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,800
No

161
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,480
I'm going on weekend

162
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,640
I don't take time off

163
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,760
No, you're a doctor

164
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
You go out with patients

165
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,600
If anything happens

166
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,840
can you take the responsibility?

167
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
Uncle Yang is a patient

168
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,440
but he's also my friend

169
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,400
I don't understand

170
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,800
It's two different things

171
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
I've said it

172
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,160
First, I don't take time off

173
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,240
I go on weekend

174
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,280
Second, Uncle Yang is my friend

175
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,520
And I just want to help him

176
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,120
to fulfill his promise to his wife

177
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,040
Do you believe everything?

178
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,560
Besides

179
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,240
there are so many people in this business

180
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,080
and so many problems to solve

181
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,120
Why don't you help them

182
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,200
to solve them one by one?

183
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,640
I haven't met them yet

184
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,480
Besides, I take my time off

185
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
to make others happy

186
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Is it a bad thing?

187
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,920
Okay

188
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,760
I'll tell Zhao Dongcheng

189
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,640
No

190
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
Why do you have to tell him

191
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,440
about this?

192
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,040
Besides, you said

193
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,480
you're my leader

194
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,640
if we want to make it clear

195
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,480
Yes, make it clear

196
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,480
So you should make it clear

197
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,400
and think about it

198
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,280
I

199
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,280
Thank you

200
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,200
Thank you

201
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,720
You're welcome

202
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,440
You're welcome

203
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,280
Thank you

204
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,120
Still no shoots?

205
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,120
No worries

206
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,520
Wang Gangkai

207
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,880
Have you bought the stocks?

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,120
Sorry, I'm late

209
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,000
It's time for you to rest

210
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,760
I'll come again next time

211
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,040
It's okay

212
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,880
It's not too late

213
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,520
I saw you when I was packing

214
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,360
just now

215
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,200
But thank god you came today

216
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,520
If you don't come today

217
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,600
I have to plan this whole weekend

218
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,120
Okay, come in

219
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,760
Hello

220
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,720
Director

221
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,480
Why are you here?

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,120
You said why I'm here

223
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,120
It's not good, director

224
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,600
I've promised Uncle Yang

225
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,440
to take him to the Phoenix Square

226
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
If you don't let me go

227
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,760
we'll become a person who doesn't have trust

228
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,400
Are you going to take Uncle Yang

229
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,600
to ride your bus?

230
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,400
Hurry up and pick him up

231
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,600
or he'll be in trouble

232
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,800
I'm not going to take him

233
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,240
I'm going to take him to the Phoenix Square

234
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm not going to take him

235
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,400
I'm not going to take him

236
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,480
I'm not going to take him

237
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,760
I'm going to take him

238
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,640
to the bus

239
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,200
Okay, I'll be right there

240
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,080
Wait for me

241
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,880
Your mouth is out of breath

242
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,960
Let's see

243
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,720
Blow a mouthwash

244
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,040
Okay

245
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,440
Look, I'll tell you

246
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,560
You have acute disease

247
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,560
Just have a good rest

248
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,160
and a good mood

249
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,760
Take your medicine on time

250
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,240
I didn't take medicine for my mission

251
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,720
What's on your mind?

252
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,960
Can you bePer cristian?

253
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,920
I'm fine

254
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,400
I'll go back join the audience

255
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,960
and beam at him

256
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,920
Hurry up

257
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,320
Where kind of look do you want?

258
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,240
Super

259
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,520
I don't have time to take him

260
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,280
You can take him for me

261
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,000
I want to go

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,360
But I'm working overtime

263
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,120
I'm taking care of the kid

264
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,240
I can't walk

265
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
How about looking for Kankan?

266
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,880
Kankan has a message

267
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
She's not alone

268
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,280
It's okay

269
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,880
Kankan

270
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,000
Kankan, did you hear that?

271
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,320
I'll call you back

272
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
What kind of colleagues are you?

273
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,040
You can take advantage of others' time

274
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,520
when you don't have time

275
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,160
What kind of company is this?

276
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,600
It's break time now

277
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,440
And look at your colleague

278
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,960
They're all useless

279
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,600
They don't want to go

280
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,080
They blame you for everything

281
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,000
Kankan wants to go

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,960
Kankan has time

283
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,160
Kankan can do it

284
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,480
Listen

285
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,920
If you don't have time to

286
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,040
treat them here

287
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,400
they can't come to the control room

288
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,600
No one will talk for you

289
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,160
It's not like that

290
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,480
It's my problem

291
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,600
I refuse

292
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,960
I don't have friends in the company

293
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,880
I won't spend all my time with you

294
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,840
Or you will just

295
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,240
blame everything on me

296
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,640
Hello

297
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,760
Hello

298
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,240
Kankan

299
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,560
Why don't you respond?

300
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,800
Do you have any time?

301
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,680
Yes

302
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,800
Fufang Square

303
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,480
I'm fine.

304
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,800
Are you okay?

305
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,160
Don't be anxious.

306
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,840
Don't be nervous.

307
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,960
Take a deep breath.

308
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,120
I'm fine, doctor.

309
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,680
You...

310
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,960
Thank you.

311
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,960
Tanlan.

312
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,600
Tanlan.

313
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,960
Don't be anxious.

314
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,800
I'll go with you.

315
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,360
Don't worry about me.

316
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,680
I'll go with you.

317
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
Where's my car key?

318
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,200
Lend me your car. I'll be back tonight.

319
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,960
It's okay. The car is not here.

320
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,800
We can take a taxi.

321
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,400
I'll let you be a half-human fan.

322
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
The social queen is not a dream.

323
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,480
We're not far from the clouds.

324
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,280
Let's go.

325
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,400
Director.

326
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,800
Why don't we drive faster?

327
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,320
Are you in a hurry?

328
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,640
Another car is passing by.

329
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,760
Do you think I'm driving a race car?

330
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,040
There are several cars passing by.

331
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,400
Oh, no.

332
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,000
The road behind

333
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,560
is in a blocked state.

334
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
If you accelerate,

335
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
we'll pass the traffic light.

336
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Then we'll be blocked.

337
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,680
Now it's all blocked.

338
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,440
What should we do?

339
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,080
Look at you.

340
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,880
When you got in the car,

341
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
you were so excited.

342
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,760
You were so powerful.

343
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,560
What?

344
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,280
I didn't mean to, Uncle Yang.

345
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,200
Uncle Yang.

346
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
Sit tight.

347
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,640
Sorry to stop you.

348
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,440
I wanted to control myself,

349
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,960
but I failed.

350
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,200
Anxay.

351
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,120
You're young

352
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,440
and you even get into a motor production car.

353
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,920
I like this feeling.

354
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,520
Wait a minute.

355
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,240
Take it easy.

356
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,120
Don't be nervous.

357
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,320
Now the injury of a 12-year-old

358
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,120
is actually quite obvious.

359
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,480
They usually

360
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,920
stay together in the car.

361
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,160
We've done a recent motorcycle Police

362
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,240
purity test,

363
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,160
visiting乘客

364
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,600
for a츠个谜

365
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:12,680
for when aكل年

366
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,480
paving crew

367
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:13,960
has to ride the bike

368
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,360
two to five times.

369
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,280
I've missed that.

370
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,760
Is that so?

371
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
You said it was so hard to get here

372
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
You can take a day off

373
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Although I can't accompany them

374
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
This one

375
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Today parents have something

376
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Can't accompany you

377
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
You play here with Khan first

378
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Mom will pick you up later

379
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Here

380
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Wait a minute

381
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
You use this headset

382
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Connect your phone

383
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
We keep talking

384
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
I'll help you

385
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Forget it

386
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
Three hours

387
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
It should be okay if I don't talk

388
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Just to ensure the safety of the little girl

389
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
I'll come back to pick her up

390
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Han Khan

391
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
In fact, social phobia

392
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Not a big disease

393
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
It's a hole in your heart

394
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
You just have to sell this hole

395
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
All the problems are actually very simple

396
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
You don't just have to do it today

397
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
And get along

398
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Let your colleagues

399
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Look at you

400
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
And I think from now on

401
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
You have to make changes too

402
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
If you don't change

403
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Those colleagues are abandoned

404
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Congratulations for your courage

405
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Take off your hat

406
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Stay with a child

407
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Say a few words

408
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
It's not that difficult

409
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Hat hat

410
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
The hole is gone

411
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Go ahead

412
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
By the way

413
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Class of the drum class

414
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
You have to give me a good review

415
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Can't leave

416
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Did you hear

417
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Miss Li

418
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Why are you here

419
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
I'll take her to you today

420
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
I'll come to pick her up later

421
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Thank you

422
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Introduce yourself, Khan Khan

423
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Hurry up, talk about that

424
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Hello, Xiaomi

425
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
My name is Wang Khan Khan

426
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
You can talk about Khan Khan

427
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
You haven't been here, have you?

428
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Let me introduce you

429
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
This place was built in 1995

430
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
It is the important tourist attraction

431
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,800
of the city of Xin City and Jiang An

432
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
And it is famous for tourism, leisure

433
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
entertainment and fitness

434
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Okay, are you a robot?

435
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
I'm a local

436
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
I don't want to hear this

437
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Sit down

438
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
How old are you?

439
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Twenty, sixteen

440
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Twenty or sixteen

441
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
I can't even speak clearly

442
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Twenty-six

443
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
How old are you?

444
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Twenty-six

445
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Uncle Yang

446
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Fengfan Square is so beautiful

447
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Let me take some photos for you

448
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Okay, thank you

449
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
You're welcome

450
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Come on, let me go up

451
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
The background is beautiful

452
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Come on, smile, Uncle Yang

453
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
One, two, three

454
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Okay

455
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Look

456
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
The light is a little dim

457
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Can you take another photo for me?

458
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Well, stand up

459
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
There is a little backlight

460
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Let me do it

461
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Come on

462
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Okay, right here

463
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Uncle, come on

464
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Okay, look at this first

465
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Do you like the light?

466
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Can you take a higher photo for me?

467
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
A little brighter

468
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
This is a little fat

469
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
No problem

470
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Okay, are you satisfied?

471
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Come on

472
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
One, two, three

473
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Uncle Yang, please take a breath

474
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Yes, you won't be fat

475
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Uncle, don't be afraid

476
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Relax, relax

477
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Take a deep breath

478
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Yes, yes, yes

479
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Three, two, one

480
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
So good

481
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Great

482
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Great, great

483
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Come on, take a look

484
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
How is it?

485
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
It's really great

486
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
You are so talented

487
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
I'm glad you like it

488
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
We are at the river

489
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
I'll take a photo for you two

490
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
We two

491
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Come on

492
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Hurry up

493
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Dear

494
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
You don't have a chance to take photos here

495
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
I just took a photo for you

496
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
It's beautiful

497
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
You two

498
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Take the photo as a background

499
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
I'll take a photo for you two

500
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Hurry up, hurry up

501
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Come on, smile

502
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Stand there

503
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
You two, stand closer

504
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Closer

505
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Okay

506
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Director Yu

507
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Director, smile

508
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Smile, smile

509
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Come on, look at the camera

510
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Three, two, one

511
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Do you like water?

512
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
I like to play with water in summer

513
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
But my mom doesn't have time to accompany me

514
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
You can't speak

515
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
You can speak your own language

516
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Tell me something about water

517
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I don't play with water

518
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Just tell me what you saw in the news

519
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
What happened to your friends

520
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
You can tell me everything about water

521
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Xiao Mi

522
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
There is a gym at the door of my house

523
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
There are children playing with water there

524
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
After a day

525
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
There are 140 jin of water in a pool

526
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
So much urine

527
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
What's the urine?

528
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
I don't know

529
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
I don't know

530
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
I don't know

531
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
I don't know

532
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
What's the urine?

533
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
95% of it is water

534
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,800
The other 5% is urine and salt

535
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
There is no harmful substances in the body

536
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
And there is urine in the sweat we sweat

537
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Chacha

538
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
There is a soup in front of you

539
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Go and buy some food for her

540
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Look, there is a sugar oil bar

541
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Do you want to buy it for me?

542
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Give me a plate of sugar oil bars

543
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
10 yuan

544
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Okay

545
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Thank you

546
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Xiao Mi

547
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Liu Jin

548
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Liu Jin

549
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Dr. Li Meilin

550
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Please come to the hospital

551
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Dr. Li Meilin

552
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Please come to the hospital

553
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Dr. Zhuang

554
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Dr. Zhuang

555
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
My blood sugar is out

556
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Dr. Zhuang

557
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
There is another patient outside

558
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Dr. Zhuang, please go ahead

559
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
We will come another day

560
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Go ahead

561
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Thank you

562
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
At noon, she came to my hospital

563
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Her boss suddenly had an accident

564
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
So she asked someone to help her

565
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
But she was sitting in the middle of the conversation

566
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
And all the colleagues in the group

567
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
They all

568
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Here you are

569
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
How is it?

570
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
You did very well today

571
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
It's not hard to communicate with others

572
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Determination, courage, change

573
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
By the way

574
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,800
This is Dr. Yu from our hospital

575
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
We met in the hospital

576
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Yes

577
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Thank you for not coming in time last time

578
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,800
The doctors in your community are so kind

579
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Dr. Shen came to help me this time

580
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Is this your boyfriend?

581
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Me?

582
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
I'm not his boyfriend

583
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
I'm not his boyfriend

584
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
I'm not his boyfriend

585
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Me?

586
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
I'm not

587
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Go and buy a bottle of water for Uncle Yang

588
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Then go to accompany Xiaomi

589
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
Don't leave her alone

590
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Ok

591
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
When she came to see me the other day

592
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I thought she had a little phobia

593
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Actually, it's not a big deal

594
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Is it just a need to have more of these scenes

595
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
To help her change?

596
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Look, it's good today

597
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
What's good?

598
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
You let a person with such a serious phobia

599
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
To pretend to be lively and cheerful

600
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,800
To socialize with strangers in public

601
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Is it good?

602
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
I don't think so

603
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
I tell you

604
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Everyone has their own comfortable way of life

605
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Even if he has some problems

606
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
You don't need to force him to change in this way

607
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Besides

608
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,800
The child who is here with the leader on the weekend

609
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Is this his working time

610
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Or his work scope?

611
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Does he have a salary

612
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Including the child who is with the leader?

613
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
If there is another time

614
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Will he refuse?

615
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Or you help him refuse?

616
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
I just want to make him

617
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Better and more inclusive of society

618
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Shen Liu, you are not helping him at all

619
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
You are just satisfying

620
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
The psychological needs you need

621
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Don't you just want to show yourself very important?

622
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Show yourself very valuable?

623
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
So much people are around

624
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Why don't you

625
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Set up a stall for free massage?

626
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
No, why is this

627
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
I have a good heart

628
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
It's like this in your mouth

629
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
So I tell you

630
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Don't think I've been giving you a few years

631
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
You can be like a boss

632
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
You can teach me every day

633
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
You see how many things you have done in the past ten years

634
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
It's a good thing

635
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
This is a lesson

636
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
You

637
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
I told you I would drive the car away

638
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
You go back by yourself today

639
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
If I put it there

640
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Put the chaser down for me

641
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Thank you for your hard work today

642
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Then we go first

643
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Goodbye, Mr. Li

644
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Bye bye, Xiaobin

645
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
I'll send you back

646
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
Doctor Shen

647
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Thank you for today

648
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
If it weren't for you

649
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
I might still be like before

650
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Will only sit there stupidly

651
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
And tomorrow

652
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
They will say again

653
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
I am a boring person

654
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Then

655
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Are you happy today?

656
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
I am happy

657
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
I have changed the file

658
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
And sent it to you

659
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
You can take it

660
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
Okay

661
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
The old man who is sick

662
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
Why can't he do it suddenly?

663
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
I am sorry

664
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
What's wrong with the patient?

665
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
The patient is fine

666
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
I just checked the room

667
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
That's my grandpa

668
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
That's 1106

669
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Grandpa just fell asleep

670
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Don't bother him

671
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
You take Xiaoxia away

672
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
I have no time to care about her

673
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
You have no time

674
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
I have time

675
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Besides, you are her mother

676
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
You don't care about her

677
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
Who cares about her?

678
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Baby, take a gift of scarf

679
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
I'll give it to you

680
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Okay

681
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Thank you

682
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Thank you

683
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Thank you

684
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Thank you

685
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Thank you

686
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Thank you

687
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Thank you

688
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Thank you

689
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Thank you

690
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Thank you

691
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Thank you

692
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
I'll go to sleep now

693
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Okay

694
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Xiaoxia

695
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
Xiaoxia

696
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Xiaoxia

697
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Xiaoxia

698
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
Xiaoxia

699
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Xiaoxia

700
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Xiaoxia

701
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Xiaoxia

702
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Grandpa is here

703
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
It's okay

704
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
It's okay

705
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,800
I'll wait for you when you go back

706
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
I'll be here with you

707
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Let's go home

708
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
I'll wait for you when you go back

709
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
I'll wait for you when you go back

710
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,800
You said you don't want others to say anything

711
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
You're relieved now, right?

712
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Should I write or not?

713
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Nothing will never change

714
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,800
Uncle Yang's wife just passed away a year ago

715
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
I didn't expect that she...

716
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,800
Forget it

717
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
What's wrong?

718
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Nothing

719
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
You told me not to care about you

720
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,800
And I insisted on bringing Uncle Yang here

721
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,800
I wasted your time and my feelings

722
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
You can't say that

723
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,800
It doesn't matter if it's a year or two

724
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
What's the difference?

725
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Is there a person or a law?

726
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,800
When will Uncle Yang change his wife to be his wife?

727
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
It doesn't matter

728
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,800
There's no right time to change

729
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,800
It doesn't mean that you must change

730
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Or you can't change

731
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Just think it's good

732
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Don't worry about others

733
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
I don't care

734
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
I'm sorry

735
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,800
Director, this is my first time to visit you

736
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
Are you hungry? I'll buy some food

737
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Okay

738
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
I'll buy whatever you want

739
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Don't be relaxed. It's spicy

740
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Thank you

741
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Director, should we tell Uncle Yang that

742
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
we'll be late again?

743
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
And you have other plans tomorrow

744
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
It's okay. Don't worry

745
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Let's sit here and watch the moon

746
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
It's a waste of time to sit here and watch the moon

747
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
and do nothing

748
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
It's a waste of time to do nothing

749
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Why can't time be wasted?

750
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Do people have to be so anxious every moment?

751
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Isn't it good to stop and watch the moon?

752
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Watch the moon

753
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Watch the moon

754
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Let's chat

755
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
You can talk about yourself

756
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Me?

757
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Are you interested?

758
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,800
I'm afraid you'll be too boring

759
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
What do you like to eat?

760
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
What do you dislike?

761
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
What color do you like?

762
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
What fruit do you like?

763
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
Just tell me

764
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
I like delicious food

765
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
I don't like bad food

766
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,800
I like yellow and green

767
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
I also have specialties

768
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
I like to pick melons

769
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
What?

770
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
I like to pick melons one by one

771
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
to keep them sweet

772
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
I can pick melons

773
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
I can ride a bike

774
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
I'm good at other sports

775
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
What about you?

776
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
I can do all kinds of sports

777
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
I also have a hobby

778
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
I don't like to eat stew

779
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
I like to eat food

780
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,800
But I'm not good at eating

781
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
I don't like to eat meat

782
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
I don't like to eat shrimp

783
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
I'm sorry

784
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800

785
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800

I'm sorry

790
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
I'm sorry

791
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
I'm sorry

792
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
I'm sorry

793
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
I'm sorry

794
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
I'm sorry

795
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
I'm sorry

796
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
I'm sorry

797
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
I'm sorry

798
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
I'm sorry

799
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm sorry

800
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
I'm sorry

801
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
I'm sorry

802
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,800
I'm sorry

803
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
I'm sorry

804
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,800
I'm sorry

805
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
I'm sorry

806
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
I'm sorry

807
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,800
I'm sorry

808
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
I'm sorry

809
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
I'm sorry

810
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
I'm sorry

811
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
I'm sorry

812
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,800
Grandpa

813
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
This time

814
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
I'll accompany you

815
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
This

816
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
This is like a girl

817
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
So messy

818
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
Let's go

819
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,800
We are stealing

820
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
I don't need to steal from you

821
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
I'm serious

822
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Will you play?

823
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Look at the data

824
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Kill five people

825
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
You die eight times

826
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
You can also play

827
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
What's the position?

828
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
I want to

829
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Come on

830
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
I'm about to finish

831
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Come on

832
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Come on

833
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
I'll teach you

834
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
What is high-end operation

835
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
Come on

836
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
What position

837
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,800
On the list

838
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
You

839
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
You know how to play games on weekends

840
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Look at the owner Yu

841
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
So full of arrangements

842
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,800
How much life

843
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,800
You know again

844
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
You're not playing

845
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
I played this once in half a year

846
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
He

847
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Ten o'clock to exercise

848
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Draw at eleven

849
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Twelve o'clock to accompany his mother

850
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
I can't

851
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
This is my life

852
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Let's make a sound

853
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,800
Don't use my screen

854
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
We are all

855
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
We are not here

856
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
What are you looking at

857
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
I'm a talent

858
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
You have a real one on the Internet

859
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
We're here

860
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
You don't

861
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Will you or not

862
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Hurry up

863
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Don't look at the left picture

864
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Five five is played by you

865
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Four four six

866
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,800
You said I don't know

867
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Who are you playing with

868
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Keep up speed

869
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Keep up speed

870
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Use your core strength

871
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
You can adjust this curve

872
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
You are too slow

873
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
Eight six

874
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
A little faster

875
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,800
So fast

876
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
Add a little more

877
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
Add to six

878
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
This is not a straight line

879
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
Three

880
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
Keep up speed

881
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Core

882
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
High

883
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
Four

884
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,800
Five

885
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
High

886
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,800
Five

887
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Finished

888
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
I'm so happy

889
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
I'm so happy

890
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
I'm so happy

891
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,800
This is the most ordinary day

892
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,800
Do you miss it too

893
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Slow down

894
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,800
I dare not go home slowly

895
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
I dare not

896
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,800
Just read the years like this

897
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,800
No worry

898
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Only the evening wind is covering the face

899
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Yes

900
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
I'm really sorry

901
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
Something happened to my mother

902
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
I want to help me find my child later

903
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
I want to find him later too

904
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
Since you have something

905
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Forget it today

906
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Although I don't take care of my child

907
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,800
I haven't gone out yet

908
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
We'll meet again next time

909
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
It's okay

910
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,800
The evening wind is covering the face

911
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,800
Okay, I'll be there

912
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
I'll be there

913
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Hello, call

914
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,800
She is waiting for you

915
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,800
There are endless topics

916
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,800
The table was waiting for the flowers

917
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Don't forget to go on a blind date

918
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
I have an appointment with someone

919
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,800
The appointment time does not appear

920
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,800
How can I wait for you

921
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,800
You can change it

922
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Okay, okay, let me press this

923
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,800
This is the most ordinary rain

924
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,800
You haven't eaten yet

925
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
Mom, I haven't eaten

926
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
I don't want to, I'm too tired

927
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,800
You sleep before you take a break

928
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
Look at you, you are not in the mood

929
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,800
Go, go, go

930
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,800
Go do your own thing

931
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,800
I hate to see you like this

932
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,800
I'll see you later

933
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Be careful

934
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,800
The evening wind is covering the face

935
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Stinky boy

936
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,800
You hit me

937
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
I'm not a dream ship

938
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,800
Look, what a coincidence

939
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,800
Dr. Shen, hello

940
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
Hello

941
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
I sit over there

942
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,800
I'm sorry that day

943
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,800
You don't have to say anything

944
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
It's good

945
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,800
You just do it yourself

946
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,800
I'll go first

947
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
I'm sorry

948
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,800
Once a person is in a certain form

949
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
After a period of time

950
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,800
It's always hard to change

951
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,800
Everyone has a different personality

952
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,800
It means that the power to stop everyone from changing is also different

953
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
Some people think that breaking through the comfort zone

954
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,800
To change yourself is the focus

955
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,800
But some people will also refuse to change

956
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
At the same time, you will get another kind of growth

957
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
As long as you can hold on to yourself

958
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,800
And bear the consequences

959
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,800
I guess that's the best result

960
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,800
Old man, when are you coming?

961
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,800
I sent him a message

962
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,800
I guess later

963
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,800
He said that today is a blind date

964
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,800
Who is that man?

965
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,800
I know him

966
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,800
Sister Zhizhi introduced him

967
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
How can that be reliable?

968
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,800
If you come over later, you'll be black

969
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
Don't talk nonsense

970
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,800
Oh, my God, sportswear

971
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,800
Sportswear

972
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,800
Why are you wearing sportswear?

973
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Didn't you go on a blind date?

974
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,800
Why did you come by yourself?

975
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,800
I didn't go

976
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,800
No wonder you wear sportswear

977
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,800
I added his WeChat account

978
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,800
He started to ask me about it without saying a few words

979
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,800
I'm so annoyed

980
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,800
He must be asking about Master Yu's age and three-dimensional

981
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,800
He must be asking if there is a house or a car

982
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,800
Can Master Yu mind him?

983
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,800
He doesn't even see it, right?

984
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,800
If Sister Zhizhi wasn't so considerate this time

985
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,800
I wouldn't even add his WeChat account

986
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,800
Really

987
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Sister Zhizhi cares about you so much

988
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,800
Let me introduce him to you

989
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,800
Okay, save me

990
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,800
I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood to do that now

991
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Aren't you single?

992
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,800
Let me introduce you to someone

993
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Okay, then introduce me to someone

994
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,800
You can tell him tomorrow

995
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,800
I'm going to tell Sister Zhizhi

996
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,800
Okay

997
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,800
Then I'll share with him

998
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,800
Sister Zhizhi's passion

999
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,800
Director, do you really want to see him?

1000
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,800
What's wrong?

1001
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,800
Why are you asking a child?

1002
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,800
No

1003
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,800
Brother, don't look at Master Yu like this

1004
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,800
When he was in school

1005
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
he could make his boyfriend cry

1006
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,800
It's okay if he is

1007
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,800
I can help you

1008
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,800
Give me your water

1009
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,800
Look

1010
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,800
You can throw it away

1011
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Because we are all ordinary people

1012
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,800
and the relationship between ordinary people

1013
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,800
will always be influenced by the outside world

1014
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
and produce various changes

1015
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,800
Often when we haven't noticed

1016
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,800
a new relationship will quietly begin

1017
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,800
Uncle

1018
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,800
Fortunately, I'll go to work tomorrow

1019
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,800
or work well

1020
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
Work well

1021
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,800
Is today the important day that Liu Jin said?

1022
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,800
Is it the first time

1023
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,800
that he was sold dry by the market

1024
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
and his grandson was thrown away?

1025
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,800
I remember it was like autumn

1026
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,800
The day of the storm

1027
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,800
Who knows what he went to do today?

1028
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,800
Storm

1029
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,800
This guy is getting old

1030
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,800
and his heart is small

1031
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,800
He has a big mood

1032
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,800
and he is so calm

1033
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,800
Can you talk in your community?

1034
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,800
I'm in this community too

1035
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,800
Say it

1036
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Say it in person

1037
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
Say it

1038
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,800
Say it

1039
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,800
Say it

1040
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,800
Say it

1041
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,800
Look at the group chat

1042
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,800
My brother Lan Wei's day

1043
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,800
This one

1044
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,800
What's wrong?

1045
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,800
This is my

1046
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,800
very, very, very important day

1047
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,800
Stop yelling

1048
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,800
Your parents went on a trip

1049
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,800
We're here with you

1050
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,800
How nice it is

1051
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,800
Don't you know how serious it is?

1052
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,800
I almost died

1053
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,800
If I hadn't been lucky

1054
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,800
you would think

1055
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,800
how could we still

1056
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,800
talk like this?

1057
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,800
Enough, stop talking

1058
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,800
Drink your medicine

1059
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,800
Shen Junjun, don't be so arrogant

1060
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,800
Look, Junjun

1061
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,800
He kicked me

1062
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,800
Come on, let me do it

1063
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,800
Let me do it

1064
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,800
Here

1065
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,800
Junjun

1066
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,800
What's wrong?

1067
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,800
This temperature is so cool

1068
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,800
Try it

1069
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,800
and it's very cold

1070
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Come on, let me try it

1071
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,800
This is medicine

1072
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,800
It's not bitter to drink with you

1073
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,800
Not bitter, you see

1074
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,800
Open your mouth, open your mouth

1075
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,800
Be brave

1076
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,800
Come on, you're the best

1077
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,800
Drink it all

1078
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,800
Drink it all, drink more

1079
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
Drink it all

1080
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,800
Okay

1081
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,800
Good boy

1082
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,800
Junjun, just get used to it

1083
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,800
You all get used to me

1084
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,800
enjoying it like a real estate agent

1085
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,800
I wish every year

1086
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,800
to have this day

1087
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,800
and this morning

1088
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,800
I want to

1089
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,800
set today

1090
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,800
as our friendship anniversary day

1091
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,800
Do we need one more day

1092
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,800
to celebrate our friendship anniversary?

1093
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
What about the next 364 days?

1094
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,800
It's an important day for me

1095
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,800
I have to think about

1096
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,800
how we should spend

1097
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,800
next year's today

1098
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,800
Enough, enough

1099
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,800
I remember it now

1100
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,800
I'll celebrate it for you next year

1101
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,800
It seems that there is a group of people

1102
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,800
What?

1103
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,800
There is a group of people

1104
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,800
What?

1105
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,800
How can there be a group of people?

1106
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,800
How can there be a group of people?

1107
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,800
So you know

1108
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,800
how I feel recently

1109
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,800
You did it on purpose

1110
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,800
You're so fast

1111
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,800
You're so fast

1112
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,800
I'm done

1113
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,800
Get up, get up

1114
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,800
I'll give you the hardest one

1115
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,800
You have to beat me to death

1116
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,800
I'll beat you to death

1117
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,800
Mom, you hit me

1118
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,800
I'm done

1119
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,800
I'm done

1120
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,800
Gao Yang

1121
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,800
Send this message to him

1122
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,800
Okay, okay

1123
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,800
You can see it from the beginning

1124
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
Okay, okay

1125
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,800
Call him if you get a message

1126
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,800
Call him if you get a message

1127
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,800
Call him if you get a message

1128
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,800
Thank you, thank you

1129
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,800
It's okay

1130
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,800
It's normal that you come here

1131
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
for 28 days or 37 days

1132
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,800
You've gained too much weight in a month

1133
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,800
This kid needs nutrition

1134
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,800
You can't just feed him meat

1135
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:22,320
You have a high sense of

1136
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,800
Come on, aunt

1137
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,800
No pulse

1138
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,800
Come on

1139
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,800
Send this back to him

1140
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,800
Brother, you're here

1141
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,800
Brother, why are you here?

1142
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,800
Why are you so absent-minded?

1143
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,800
I'm taking a medical bike

1144
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,800
I just passed by

1145
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,800
So many people today

1146
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,800
The people in the college are so many

1147
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,800
I'll send Yi Yi back later

1148
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,800
I'll come and help

1149
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,800
No need

1150
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
It's easier than taking the kid

1151
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,800
Yes

1152
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,800
Doctor, doctor

1153
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,800
Come on, come on

1154
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,800
Come on, come on

1155
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,800
Brother Yisen is working

1156
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,800
Let's go, let's go

1157
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,800
Dad, I can work with Brother Yisen

1158
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,800
You can't work with me

1159
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,800
Yes

1160
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,800
And you forgot

1161
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,800
You said you wanted to learn how to ride a bike faster

1162
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,800
You have a competition with him

1163
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,800
Yes, dad, you hurry up

1164
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

1165
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,800
You guys go inside and eat

1166
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,800
Go

1167
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,800
Okay

1168
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,800
Sit down

1169
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,800
Auntie, get me some ice

1170
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,800
Okay

1171
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,800
Guan Xu

1172
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,800
Nurse Xiaotan

1173
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,800
Just call me Xiaotan

1174
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,800
Don't call me nurse

1175
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,800
I don't have a nurse uniform today

1176
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,800
You are today

1177
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,800
I'm on leave

1178
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,800
I heard you were in the medical examination

1179
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,800
So I came to see you

1180
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,800
What else do you want to buy?

1181
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,800
I'll buy some water for everyone

1182
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,800
I'll help you

1183
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,800
Thank you

1184
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,800
Which one?

1185
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,800
Almost

1186
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,800
Enough

1187
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,800
Auntie

1188
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,800
I'll pack the ice separately

1189
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,800
Okay

1190
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,800
Auntie, how much is this fan?

1191
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,800
It's expired

1192
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,800
It's sold at a low price

1193
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,800
One yuan

1194
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,800
I'll take them all

1195
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,800
I heard from your director Yu

1196
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,800
You like to eat watermelon

1197
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,800
Would you like to drink fresh fruit juice?

1198
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,800
I'll treat you

1199
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,800
No, thanks

1200
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,800
Do you have time next weekend?

1201
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
I want to ask you out for dinner

1202
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,800
Watch a movie

1203
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,800
I'm sorry, Xiaotan

1204
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,800
I'm sorry

1205
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,800
I'm sorry

1206
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,800
I'm sorry

1207
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,800
I have someone I like

1208
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,800
Auntie, how much is this?

1209
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,800
Pay

1210
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,800
Dr. Gao

1211
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,800
Nurse Xia

1212
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,800
What do you want?

1213
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,800
I'll buy water

1214
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,800
I want to buy some water

1215
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,800
You're welcome

1216
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,800
Water

1217
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,800
Water

1218
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,800
Thank you

1219
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,800
And the fan

1220
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,800
Where did you get it?

1221
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,800
I bought it

1222
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,800
I saw you bought it when it was hot

1223
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,800
You can't pay for it

1224
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,800
It's okay

1225
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,800
I bought it for everyone

1226
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,800
No need to pay for it

1227
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,800
You're so thoughtful

1228
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,800
Look, I bought several of them

1229
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,800
Send them to me

1230
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,800
Okay

1231
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,800
Dr. Xiao

1232
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,800
You guys, hurry up

1233
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,800
Dr. Zhao, have some water

1234
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,800
Thank you

1235
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,800
You've worked hard

1236
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,800
Why are you here today?

1237
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,800
I came to see you today

1238
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,800
Dr. Zhao

1239
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,800
I found that Guan Xu

1240
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,800
is a little strange recently

1241
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,800
How strange?

1242
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,800
Didn't you find that

1243
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,800
he's been in some trouble recently?

1244
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,800
Kid, I'm home

1245
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,800
I'll go with you

1246
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,800
Okay

1247
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,800
What's the matter?

1248
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,800
Is he having a relationship with you?

1249
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,800
How can he be with me?

1250
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,800
You can observe it

1251
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,800
yourself

1252
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,800
Okay, I'll observe it

1253
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,800
Brother Lu Ting

1254
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,800
Goodbye, brother

1255
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,800
Goodbye, aunt

1256
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,800
Goodbye, uncle

1257
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,800
Kid

1258
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,800
Why did you call him brother

1259
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,800
and call me uncle?

1260
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,800
You have a problem with the name

1261
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,800
Yes

1262
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,800
You call me brother

1263
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,800
and call him sister

1264
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,800
Sister

1265
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Why are you so boring?

1266
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,800
Call

1267
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,800

Bye

1270
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,800
What about me?

1271
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,800
You call him brother

1272
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,800
and call me brother

1273
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,800
