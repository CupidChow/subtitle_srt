1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,620
Then I ask Wang Man to make your

00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,620
I'm a little bit of a

3
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,620
I'm a little bit of a

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,620
I'm a little bit of a

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,620
I'm a little bit of a

6
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,620
I'm a little bit of a

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,620
I'm a little bit of a

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,620
I'm a little bit of a

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,620
I'm a little bit of a

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,620
I'm a little bit of a

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,620
I'm a little bit of a

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,620
I'm a little bit of a

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,620
I'm a little bit of a

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,620
I'm a little bit of a

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,620
I'm a little bit of a

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,620
I'm a little bit of a

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,620
I'm a little bit of a

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,620
I'm a little bit of a

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,620
I'm a little bit of a

20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,620
I'm a little bit of a

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,620
I'm a little bit of a

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,620
I'm a little bit of a

23
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,620
I'm a little bit of a

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,620
I'm a little bit of a

25
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,620
I'm a little bit of a

26
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,620
I'm a little bit of a

27
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,620
I'm a little bit of a

28
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,620
I'm a little bit of a

29
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,620
I'm a little bit of a

30
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,620
I'm a little bit of a

31
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,620
I'm a little bit of a

32
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,620
I'm a little bit of a

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,620
I'm a little bit of a

34
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,620
I'm a little bit of a

35
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,620
I'm a little bit of a

36
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,620
I'm a little bit of a

37
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,620
I'm a little bit of a

38
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,620
I'm a little bit of a

39
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,620
I'm a little bit of a

40
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,620
I'm a little bit of a

41
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,620
I'm a little bit of a

42
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,620
I'm a little bit of a

43
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,620
I'm a little bit of a

44
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,620
I'm a little bit of a

45
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,620
I'm a little bit of a

46
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,620
I'm dumb

47
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,620
Old.

48
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,620
The bow and arrow are so cool right.

49
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,540
We're getting the

50
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,740
claim here tomorrow.

51
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,580
You'll let them see that and God won't floor you with the bow and arrow.

52
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,800
It has nothing to do with you.

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,640
This is a dialect

54
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Then you can go do now.

55
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,940
He tells them the imprisoned man that

56
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,020
You should rest

57
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,820
No, no

58
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,460
Can you check the patient in No.13 City?

59
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,300
I'm afraid she's not feeling well after the night shift

60
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,940
I'll go there right away

61
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,220
I'll go

62
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,220
I told you five times

63
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,060
Why don't you go there?

64
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,860
Which one?

65
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,260
No.36

66
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,860
No.36 just went there

67
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,940
She vomited

68
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,980
What did she eat?

69
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,220
How do I know?

70
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,300
She vomited. Can you go there quickly?

71
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,980
Hurry up

72
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,620
Sorry

73
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,060
It's all our fault

74
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,700
I'll go there

75
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,660
You go there, Yu Shi

76
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
She's so ungrateful

77
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,300
She's so ungrateful

78
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,220
What should we do?

79
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,500
What are you talking about?

80
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,740
Director

81
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,020
What should we choose for this question?

82
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,660
C

83
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,660
No

84
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,700
Dr. Xiao chose A

85
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
It's C

86
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,180
No

87
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,500
He said A is the right answer

88
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,980
I've been a nurse for three years

89
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,180
How many years has he been a nurse?

90
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,940
By the way

91
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,780
Dr. Xiao doesn't like my brother, does he?

92
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,060
You've known each other for a long time

93
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,180
Ignore him

94
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,220
What should I do?

95
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,820
You should read carefully

96
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,940
Director

97
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,940
Can you do it?

98
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,140
I promise I won't kill him

99
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,340
You're writing an article

100
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,940
You've been working for so long

101
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,140
and you still want to write an article

102
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,540
I have to write it, right?

103
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,540
You've written so many words

104
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,540
Can you read carefully?

105
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,140
You don't know such a simple question

106
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,540
Have you never studied in school?

107
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,340
You haven't taught teachers when you were an intern

108
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,740
You're so shy to ask me

109
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,540
I tell you

110
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,940
People need to read more if they have a bad brain

111
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,940
If not, it's not good

112
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,940
You can't do it

113
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,940
You can't do it

114
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,940
You can't do it

115
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
You can't do it

116
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,940
If you have a bad brain, it's not a problem of attitude

117
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,540
If you're not serious, just go back

118
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,940
Don't waste your time here

119
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,940
I'm not serious

120
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,540
I'm not serious

121
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,540
You've finished this question

122
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,140
If you have any questions, just ask me

123
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,540
Yidi

124
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,340
I'll call you again

125
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,540
The patient we're here to pick up

126
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,540
is a little special

127
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,540
I know

128
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,940
He is a serious patient

129
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,740
We're here to do service

130
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,740
and interview

131
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,140
After the approval of the family

132
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,540
we'll do a health check-up

133
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,140
Great

134
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,140
You did a good job

135
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,140
The health check-up is here

136
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,340
Hello

137
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,340
Of course

138
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,740
I've memorized his information

139
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,540
His name is Xiaoyu

140
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,940
He has been addicted to addicted drugs

141
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,540
He is a serious mental disorder patient

142
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,340
He has been addicted to addicted drugs

143
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,540
OK, you're great

144
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,340
OK

145
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,540
You'll know when you see him

146
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,940
He's not a child

147
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,540
He's only 17 or 18 years old

148
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,540
But you must remember

149
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,140
You can't show any mental illness after you see him

150
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,940
You have to relax

151
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,140
I know

152
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,540
We're professionals

153
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,340
The patient is here

154
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,140
Xu You

155
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,340
I just want to say thank you to you

156
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,140
I'll show you later

157
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,740
Brother

158
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,340
Who is the person holding the bag over there?

159
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,540
I didn't get the chance to ask

160
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,940
I won't tell you

161
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,340
You even sold me a coffin

162
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
Brother Yu

163
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,940
The doctor is coming soon

164
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,740
We won't hurt anymore

165
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,540
We won't hurt anymore

166
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,340
I'm so scared

167
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,540
We won't hurt anymore

168
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,340
Why does it hurt so much?

169
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,140
Mr. Xu

170
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,340
Let's have a shot, OK?

171
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,340
It won't hurt anymore

172
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,940
Take him out first

173
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,940
Let's go

174
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,140
Brother, I'm not afraid

175
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,740
I'm here

176
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
Go out first

177
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,540
It'll be fine

178
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Go out first and let Brother Jun have a shot

179
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
Hurry up

180
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,540
Hurry up

181
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,740
It's so painful

182
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,740
We won't feel bad if we have a shot

183
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,540
OK?

184
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,740
Mr. Xu

185
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Let's have a shot

186
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,340
OK

187
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,740
I'm so tired

188
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,340
Trust me

189
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,140
Come on

190
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,940
A family

191
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,540
has a life

192
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,940
The whole family can't bear it

193
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,140
I understand your feeling now

194
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,540
But you have to be strong

195
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,740
I'll be by your side

196
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,140
I'll be by your side with Mr. Xu

197
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,540
Why are you still crying?

198
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,340
It'll be fine

199
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,340
Zhen has already hit Grandpa Shi

200
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,340
He won't feel as bad as he did just now

201
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,740
You have to hold on

202
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,740
Don't fall down

203
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,540
I'll work at the basement tonight

204
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,540
Call me if you need anything

205
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,940
OK

206
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,340
Brother, don't be nervous

207
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,340
It's Xiaoyu's father's birthday today

208
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,540
So the family may want to make something delicious

209
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,140
Dr. Shen

210
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:47,940
Zhen

211
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,140
Thank you for your hard work

212
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,140
You've come a long way

213
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,540
Come on, have some water

214
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,340
Thank you

215
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,340
Is this young man new here?

216
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:54,740
Yes

217
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,540
He's the new doctor of

218
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,740
the chronic disease department of our community hospital

219
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,940
Dr. Ko

220
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,740
Hello

221
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,740
I'll explain the situation to him

222
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,140
OK

223
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,940
Sit down

224
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,340
Look at the mess

225
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,340
Are you scared?

226
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,140
No, no

227
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,740
We don't usually do this at home

228
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,940
It's my birthday

229
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,740
I just caught up with my son

230
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,940
and wanted to eat blood sauce duck

231
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,940
I just bought it for him

232
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,740
He's helping me out

233
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,540
and you're here

234
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,540
I'm sorry, Fengqiao

235
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,940
Have some water

236
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,940
Brother Yu, we're sorry

237
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,140
to bother you in the first place

238
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,740
You're the one who said that

239
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,740
Well

240
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,540
We want to do a simple

241
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,740
physical examination for Xiaoyu

242
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,540
and then we'll get to know

243
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,540
the latest situation

244
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:34,940
OK

245
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,340
Do you think it's OK?

246
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,940
OK

247
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,340
Did you see that?

248
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,940
Now the duck blood

249
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,140
is his treasure

250
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,940
He keeps it

251
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,940
wherever he puts it

252
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,740
Xiaoyu

253
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,140
Xiaoyu

254
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,540
Look at me

255
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,540
Do you remember who I am?

256
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,740
Xiaoyu

257
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,540
Brother is talking to you

258
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,340
He's rude

259
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,740
Brother Yu, it's OK

260
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,140
It's just a small problem

261
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,740
It's just a small problem

262
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
Just coax him

263
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
I'll talk to him

264
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:06,740
OK

265
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,540
Xiaoyu

266
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,740
Here's the thing

267
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,740
My brother and I

268
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,540
have always wanted to play

269
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,540
a game of doctors and patients

270
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,740
We both want to play doctors

271
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,940
But

272
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,140
no one

273
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,740
is willing to play the patient for us

274
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,140
Would you like to

275
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,340
play the patient for us

276
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,340
and play with us?

277
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,340
We can also ask dad

278
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,140
to join us

279
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,940
OK?

280
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,340
Xiaoyu

281
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,940
Be good

282
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,340
Let's go out together

283
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,140
and play games with the two big brothers

284
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,940
OK?

285
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,140
Let's go

286
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,540
Xiaoyu is so good

287
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,740
Let's go

288
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,540
Brothers

289
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,940
are here to see you

290
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Come on, sit here

291
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
Yes, sit down, Xiaoyu

292
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,540
Sit down

293
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,540
Then I'll take a picture of you

294
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,140
which is very beautiful, OK?

295
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,940
Come on

296
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,940
Xiaoyu, do a hand gesture

297
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,140
Look, look at dad

298
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,740
One, two, three

299
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,740
OK

300
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,140
It's very beautiful

301
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,540
Then the game starts

302
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,740
Try it

303
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,340
OK

304
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,540
Come on, let's raise our hands

305
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,740
This hand

306
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,540
This side

307
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,140
Yes

308
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,540
Then gently

309
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,140
put the sleeves on

310
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,140
Don't be afraid

311
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,340
I'll put it on for you

312
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,140
Come on

313
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,740
Brother, I'll put it on for you

314
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,340
Don't be afraid

315
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,140
It's OK

316
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,740
It's OK

317
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
It doesn't hurt, right?

318
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,140
OK

319
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
It's about to start

320
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,540
The test begins

321
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,340
Please speak out loud

322
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,940
Look, she can speak

323
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,140
Brother Lu Jin

324
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,340
High pressure 130

325
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,140
Low pressure 70

326
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,940
Heart rate 82

327
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,740
Empty abdominal cavity

328
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,540
Is there any problem?

329
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,740
OK, no problem

330
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,940
Brother Lu

331
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,140
Xiaoyu's height and weight

332
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,940
are all standard

333
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,740
So you don't have to worry

334
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,540
No problem

335
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,940
That's great

336
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,340
Besides

337
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,540
is her size normal now?

338
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,740
Yes

339
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,140
Then in life

340
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,140
washing, brushing teeth

341
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,340
washing face, dressing

342
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
can she do it alone?

343
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,340
Or do you need your support?

344
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,540
It's all right

345
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,940
You know

346
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,740
the child will leave as soon as she leaves

347
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,540
I still hope she can

348
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,940
learn as much as possible

349
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,940
these basic skills

350
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,940
In case one day I

351
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,940
One day I'm not well

352
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,540
I'm afraid the child will be born

353
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,740
Yes

354
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,340
But don't worry

355
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,740
We doctors

356
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,940
will try our best to help her

357
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,140
Thank you

358
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,140
If there's any problem

359
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,740
you can come to the hospital at any time

360
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,740
OK, I will

361
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,740
Then there's nothing else

362
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,740
We can go

363
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,140
Don't go

364
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,540
Let's go after dinner

365
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:52,940
Brother Yu

366
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,140
we won't stay here today

367
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,740
There are other arrangements at the hospital

368
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,340
Next time

369
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,940
Next time we will definitely eat here

370
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,340
There is one more

371
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,540
Happy birthday

372
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,140
Happy birthday

373
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
No, no, no

374
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,540
Dr. Shen

375
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,540
You bought

376
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,540
everything in my life

377
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,240
Take it back

378
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,140
Brother Yu

379
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,940
I just told you

380
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,740
not to be so polite

381
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,140
You are polite to me again

382
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,540
You said it was the first time

383
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,540
I made a mouth-shape

384
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,340
and I just got your birthday

385
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,540
Now it's good

386
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,540
In the future, every time

387
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,140
I do a physical checkup

388
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,340
I will celebrate your birthday

389
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,540
Then in this day

390
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,140
I will tell you I am healthy

391
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,340
Isn't that the best gift?

392
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,940
Yes

393
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,540
Yes

394
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,340
Don't push it

395
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,140
This is our tender heart

396
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:39,940
The clothes I put on are very quiet

397
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,940
Everything is soft and calm

398
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,940
Thank you

399
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,940
Xiaoyu, come out

400
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
The two big brothers are leaving

401
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,940
Come out and say hello

402
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,940
Come on

403
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,940
The two big brothers are leaving

404
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,940
Say hello to the two big brothers

405
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,940
Xiaoyu, my name is Shen Xingxin

406
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,940
I'm the one who is the heart of Sankejin

407
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
Next time you see me

408
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,940
you have to say hello to me

409
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,940
My name is Guan Xu

410
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,940
Guan of the switch, Xu of the sequence

411
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,940
Don't forget me

412
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,940
Then we'll go first

413
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,940
Thank you

414
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
Thank you

415
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,940
At this moment

416
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,940
I finally understand

417
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,940
Why people who are green

418
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,940
are willing to stay in this

419
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,940
strange community hospital

420
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,940
Although the death of a person is cool

421
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,940
there are many diseases in this world

422
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,940
It's not life or death

423
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
Don't move

424
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,940
Don't move

425
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,940
It's okay

426
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,940
It's okay

427
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,940
The relationship between people

428
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,940
is not just a medical exchange

429
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,940
This level

430
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,940
may not be understood by some peers

431
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
Maybe it is far from

432
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,940
the original intention of learning medicine

433
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,940
So what?

434
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
As long as we can bring

435
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,940
a little hope to each patient

436
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,940
that's enough

437
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,940
I think what we do

438
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,940
is also cool

439
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
And cool

440
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
I heard that there were patients

441
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,940
at three o'clock yesterday

442
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,940
at the office

443
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,940
Brother Jun didn't sleep at all

444
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,940
Every time

445
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,940
I feel like I'm with Junxun

446
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,940
That's true

447
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,940
One of the 14 services of the public

448
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,940
is the heavy-duty mental health management

449
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,940
Every season

450
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,940
patients are going to the hospital to get medicine

451
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,940
Look

452
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,940
Mental health disorder

453
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,940
Double-emotional disorder

454
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,940
It's a very serious problem

455
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
It's a very serious problem

456
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
It's a very serious problem

457
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,940
It's a very serious problem

458
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,940
Mental disorder

459
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,940
Double-emotional disorder

460
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,940
Separate emotional mental disorder

461
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,940
Paralytic mental disorder

462
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,940
Dementia

463
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,940
Mental development

464
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,940
All people in the community

465
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,940
are responsible for us

466
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,940
It's a big responsibility

467
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,940
This is the first time

468
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,940
I find Dr. Shen

469
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,940
so good at it

470
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,940
Yes

471
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,940
He is very good at memorizing

472
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,940
Okay

473
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,940
You should have a rest

474
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,940
Okay, you two go

475
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,940
Go

476
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,940
I'll take it

477
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,940
Okay

478
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,940
Are you here for a check-up?

479
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
We are still on the afternoon break

480
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,940
I'm not here for a check-up

481
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940
I'm here to see Dr. Shen

482
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,940
Dr. Shen?

483
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
Dr. Shen, someone is here

484
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,940
Dr. Shen is inside

485
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,940
Thank you

486
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
Hi, Liu Jun

487
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
Guo Ting

488
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,940
Long time no see

489
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,940
You haven't seen me since high school, right?

490
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,940
The monitor gave me a punch

491
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
I saw you were not inside

492
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,940
Then I knew you were abroad

493
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,940
When did you come back?

494
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,940
Are you still leaving?

495
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,940
Is it the same as before?

496
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,940
I met my uncle and aunt several times

497
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,940
You came to see a doctor today

498
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,940
Are you not feeling well

499
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,940
or uncle and aunt?

500
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,940
None

501
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,940
Sorry, I'm so happy to see you

502
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
I asked you a lot of questions

503
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,940
You don't know where to start

504
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940
I also accidentally

505
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,940
saw your name at the door

506
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,940
You see, we haven't contacted each other

507
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,940
for so many years

508
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,940
How about adding a WeChat

509
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,940
to chat?

510
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
Okay, I'll scan you

511
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,940
Okay, added

512
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,940
Okay

513
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,940
You are quite professional

514
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,940
I'm not

515
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,940
I'm not good at anything

516
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,940
When I came back

517
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,940
I remembered

518
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,940
I was studying

519
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,940
It's interesting to study

520
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,940
But after so long

521
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,940
you haven't changed at all

522
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,940
When I saw you in the hospital today

523
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,940
I was shocked

524
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,940
I thought you were a doctor

525
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,940
I was shocked

526
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,940
I was shocked

527
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,940
I was shocked

528
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,940
I was shocked

529
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,940
I was shocked

530
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,940
I was shocked

531
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,940
I was shocked

532
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
I thought you had come back from a trip

533
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,940
I'm so old

534
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
I even have a phlegm

535
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,940
Look

536
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,940
You are talking nonsense again

537
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
I've always been like this

538
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,940
Do you remember

539
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,940
when we were in the same table

540
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,940
many boys wrote you love letters

541
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,940
You were embarrassed to look at it

542
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
In the end, I made the song

543
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,940
and sang it for you

544
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Yes, yes, yes

545
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,940
Right?

546
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
You sang that song. It's so funny

547
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,940
But now I think

548
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,940
I was embarrassed at that time

549
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
Although

550
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
I was beaten at the end

551
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,940
But you were embarrassed too

552
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
You even gave me a lesson

553
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,940
Don't mention it

554
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
I can't even get five points

555
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,940
if I don't move up and down

556
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
I don't have confidence

557
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,940
I tell you, you are a student

558
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,940
You are not a professor

559
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,940
I can get five points

560
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,940
It's already the limit

561
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,940
Do you remember

562
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,940
a few days before we graduated

563
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,940
you told me there was a shop

564
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,940
Then we made an appointment

565
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,940
to go back to fish and eat together

566
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,940
To vent out?

567
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,940
The public village?

568
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,940
It's been too long. I forgot

569
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
It's okay

570
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,940
You are back

571
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,940
We have a lot of opportunities

572
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,940
Okay, we can meet fans when we have time

573
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,940
Okay

574
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
Sorry

575
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,940
I have something to do. I have to go

576
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,940
Okay

577
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,940
We have time

578
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,940
for our old classmate's party

579
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,940
Then we can meet

580
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
You are busy

581
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,940
Okay, bye bye

582
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,940
Bye bye

583
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,940
She left without saying goodbye

584
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,940
She is a princess

585
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,940
What's wrong with you, brother?

586
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,940
Why are you coughing so hard?

587
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
It's okay

588
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,940
Are you in pain?

589
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,940
I'm fine

590
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
I just had a mouthful of saliva

591
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,940
I'm really fine

592
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
Don't hide it from me

593
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,940
I didn't hide it from you

594
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,940
Little boy

595
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,940
Don't stay here forever

596
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,940
Go back to your hometown

597
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,940
You can go back to your hometown

598
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,940
I'm fine

599
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,940
You are so good

600
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
You are so good

601
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,940
Go

602
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,940
Go and do your own business

603
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,940
Go

604
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,940
I don't have anything to do

605
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,940
If you have nothing to do, do it

606
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,940
Go

607
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,940
Talk to the big guys

608
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,940
Talk

609
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,940
You are so busy all day

610
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,940
What's the point of being an old man?

611
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,940
Grandpa, I'm fine

612
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,940
What's the point of being an old man?

613
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,940
Go

614
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,940
Go and listen to me

615
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,940
Or you will be angry

616
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,940
Why are you angry?

617
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,940
Go

618
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
Okay, okay, don't be angry

619
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,940
I will go

620
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
Okay?

621
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,940
Are you really okay?

622
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,940
I'm fine

623
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,940
Call me if you need anything

624
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,940
Why are you so nagging?

625
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,940
Okay, okay, go

626
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
Go

627
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
Xiaoxi

628
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,940
You are here again

629
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,940
Aunt

630
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,940
Come in, come in

631
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,940
Your brother is angry with you again

632
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,940
What's wrong with your brother?

633
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
By the way

634
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,940
You can take the drinks in the refrigerator

635
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,940
I won't say hello to you

636
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,940
Aunt

637
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,940
Where is Director Yu?

638
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,940
A friend of his

639
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,940
He is your brother's college classmate

640
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,940
They said they would go to the neighborhood

641
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,940
What's wrong with this kid?

642
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,940
Who is that?

643
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,940
You are interesting

644
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,940
You finally think I'm interesting

645
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,940
There are more than a dozen pages of information

646
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,940
You take so many pages every time

647
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,940
You don't come to send information

648
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,940
I have a good point

649
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,940
What I think in my heart

650
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,940
others will know

651
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
What are you thinking now?

652
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,940
I don't know

653
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
Guess

654
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,940
I want to ask you out for a meal the day after tomorrow

655
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,940
No, I have an appointment

656
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,940
Or the day after tomorrow

657
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,940
It's weekend

658
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,940
I will give you information

659
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,940
And we can watch a movie

660
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,940
Have a meal

661
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
Then please ask Dr. Xiao

662
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,940
Next time you must bring all the information

663
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,940
No problem

664
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,940
Dr. Guan, you scared me

665
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,940
It's not a coincidence

666
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,940
Director Yu and I have something to say

667
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,940
If you have any questions

668
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,940
Come to me at work

669
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,940
How about you?

670
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,940
Promise me

671
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,940
I want to play badminton with you

672
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,940
Play badminton

673
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,940
Play badminton

674
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
I don't play with you

675
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,940
I don't like playing

676
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,940
I want to play with you

677
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
Why?

678
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,940
Revenge for Zhao Dongcheng

679
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
I didn't expect you and Dongcheng

680
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,940
have such a good relationship

681
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,940
Besides

682
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,940
What does it have to do with me

683
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
if you want to revenge for him?

684
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,940
No

685
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
See you on the weekend

686
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,940
What weekend?

687
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,940
No time

688
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,940
You beat Zhao Dongcheng

689
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
I don't need you

690
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Who are you looking for?

691
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
I want to revenge for my brother

692
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
You are his brother

693
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
Yes, we are close

694
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,940
Very close

695
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
What are you looking at?

696
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,940
Go

697
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,940
Go to the women's basketball court

698
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,940
Go

699
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,940
Really?

700
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,940
Really?

701
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,940
Two to zero

702
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,940
Three to zero

703
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,940
Dongcheng asked me to come to you

704
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,940
He said you often play badminton

705
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
I often play

706
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,940
But they always say I am a talent

707
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,940
Dr. Zhao, you play badminton again

708
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,940
Yes, I finished

709
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,940
I want to play badminton

710
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
You are familiar with this

711
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,940
Yes

712
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,940
I know almost everyone in the Park Park Park

713
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,940
Can you do it?

714
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
Li Chi

715
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,940
Why are you here?

716
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,940
Why are you here?

717
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
To play badminton

718
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,940
Why did they fight?

719
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,940
They will be in a fight

720
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,940
Because of you

721
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
Revenge for me

722
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,940
You are quite self-aware

723
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,940
Yes

724
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,940
I thought you were good

725
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,940
Come on

726
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
I will go to play badminton

727
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,940
You really want to play badminton with him?

728
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,940
Are you willing to do it?

729
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
What's wrong?

730
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
I tell you

731
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,940
True love is life, far from the chicken

732
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,940
Especially this kind of chicken

733
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,940
The chicken that is big and brave

734
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,940
I am so jealous

735
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,940
11 to 3

736
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,940
The loser is the one who lost

737
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,940
You lost

738
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,940
What are you talking about?

739
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,940
You lost to the loser

740
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,940
What?

741
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,940
You are the loser

742
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,940
I am jealous

743
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,940
Guan Xun

744
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,940
Do you need to be happy with him?

745
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
What are you doing?

746
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,940
Okay

747
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
What?

748
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,940
I am revenge for you

749
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,940
Okay

750
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,940
Is it necessary to play badminton?

751
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,940
Go to the master

752
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,940
Guan Xun

753
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,940
I am calling you

754
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,940
Wait for me

755
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
Go

756
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,940
Let's talk about something

757
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
It has nothing to do with him

758
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,940
Zhao Dacheng

759
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,940
Listen

760
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,940
Your brother came to me for a ride

761
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,940
Not me

762
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,940
He is a kid

763
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,940
You can tell me if you need anything

764
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,940
Okay, I will tell you

765
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,940
How many times have I called you?

766
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,940
How many WeChat messages have I sent you?

767
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,940
How did you come to our hospital?

768
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,940
Hello

769
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,940
Dong Cheng

770
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,940
You promised me

771
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,940
You haven't thought about it yet

772
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
There are many things

773
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
that people like us want to do in this hospital

774
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,940
I know

775
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,940
Can you give me some time to think about it?

776
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,940
Think about it

777
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,940
How many times have you said this?

778
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,940
I am telling you

779
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,940
This opportunity is not for everyone

780
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,940
I understand

781
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,940
I will tell you when I have news

782
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,940
I don't know what you are thinking

783
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,940
Just in

784
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,940
Just in such a community hospital

785
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,940
You are in the hands for a lifetime

786
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,940
There is a need for a doctor like you in this world

787
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
to pull people back from the physical side

788
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,940
You need a doctor like me, right?

789
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,940
I know half of the people in this community

790
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
I know half of the people in this group

791
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,940
That is my brother

792
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
That is my father

793
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,940
and my new friend

794
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,940
I choose to stay here

795
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,940
to protect them

796
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
Do you understand?

797
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,940
Okay, Zhang Dong Cheng

798
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,940
I understand what you are thinking

799
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,940
Take care of yourself

800
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,940
Do you really hate Xiao Hai that much?

801
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,940
Yes

802
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,940
He looks down on Zhao Dong Cheng

803
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,940
and the community hospital

804
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,940
So I want to avenge Zhao Dong Cheng

805
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,940
and the community hospital

806
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,940
and also myself

807
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,940
I can't tell

808
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,940
You and Zhao Dong Cheng

809
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,940
are like brothers

810
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,940
Do you like Wang Xiu and Wang Zi?

811
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,940
Yes

812
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,940
I like them

813
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
Who do you think

814
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,940
Yue Qianlong, Ma He, and Liu Chuanfeng

815
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
are better than them?

816
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,940
They two

817
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
They two

818
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,940
I think they are both good

819
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,940
Not like each other

820
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
Okay, I'll go back first

821
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,940
You are leaving now?

822
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
What else?

823
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,940
I want to tell you

824
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,940
I do hate Xiao Hai

825
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,940
But not because he

826
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940
wants to win Zhao Dong Cheng

827
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
I hate them

828
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,940
I hate them because

829
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,940
he always entangle you

830
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,940
I hate them

831
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,940
And I like Wang Xiu and Wang Zi

832
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,940
not because I like them

833
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,940
because I see them

834
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,940
but because you like them

835
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,940
I like them

836
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,940
So, do you understand?

837
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,940
In my eyes

838
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,940
I just see you

839
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
as a colleague

840
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,940
and a good friend's brother

841
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,940
Do you understand?

842
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,940
Yes

843
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,940
I'm leaving

844
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,940
Director

845
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,940
I know you don't like me now

846
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,940
I didn't like you before

847
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,940
But I like you now

848
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,940
I believe

849
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,940
you will like me

850
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,940
Wait

851
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,940
Wait

852
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
Now

853
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,940
What we need to take as cares

854
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,940
is the fine weather

855
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,940
So far we have

856
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,940
the lower price

857
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,940
Why do you spend money?

858
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,940
I ask you not to buy clothes

859
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,940
How much is it?

860
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,780
What brand is it?

861
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,540
Is it still a English name?

862
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,820
How to spell it?

863
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,780
Tao.

864
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,940
What is Tao?

865
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,940
Yes.

866
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,980
I have to go out and show off.

867
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,180
My friends ask me what brand it is.

868
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:27,660
Mom.

869
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,260
I have to say it out.

870
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,460
The door is broken again.

871
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,620
The bubble is full.

872
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,100
When did you buy it?

873
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,580
Did the weather affect it?

874
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,860
That's good.

875
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,060
You should have told me earlier

876
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,420
if you wanted to come back.

877
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,980
Okay.

878
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,100
I see.

879
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,580
Okay.

880
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,740
When did it happen?

881
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,620
Did it fly?

882
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,460
Why is the door still not repaired?

883
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,460
Hello, Brother Li.

884
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,540
Zhang Xiaobao, give me your car keys.

885
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,300
What's wrong?

886
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,060
My mom fell down.

887
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,900
I don't know what happened.

888
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,060
I have to take her to see her.

889
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,980
Hurry up. I'll take you there.

890
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,580
Let's go.

891
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,620
The After thinking she would change her mind

892
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,100
and Musi suddenly makes a face.

893
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:19,940
Pretty.

894
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,940
How are you getting on that bike soon?

895
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,900
Thank you.

896
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,140
That way

897
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,500
Clothes left

898
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,180
So fast

899
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,420
What's wrong?

900
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,140
No additives

901
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,980
Mom!

902
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,400
Doesn't Li Er Bao know that

903
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,940
the patient's condition is very bad?

904
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,820
What's wrong with his health, Mom?

905
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,220
I can just climb up there to have a look if it will lead to something.

906
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,940
But, I'm really ill.

907
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,860
I can't order food from a restaurant

908
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,780
because I'm going home.

909
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,300
I'll call the Doctor.

910
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,660
I'll call the Doctor every day.

911
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:26,380
Then I can see your health condition once I see him and his health condition before you go home.

912
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,460
Don't get some kind of panic.

913
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,180
Tell me.

914
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,140
How is my health condition health now?

915
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,820
Are you admitted to hospital now?

916
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,100
Aren't you afraid of your health?

917
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,700
Give it.

918
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,080
Don't look at it.

919
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,300
If you don't believe that l?

920
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,940
My electr?

921
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,620
I can use a different method.

922
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,960
Gosh.

923
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,220
I like the vase.

924
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,220
I'm not.

925
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,020
Can you be quiet for a while?

926
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,660
I can see you're dizzy.

927
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,220
Okay, let me sit here.

928
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,820
It's good for you to be active.

929
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,620
Protect your eyesight.

930
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,900
Your cup is nice too.

931
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,740
There are A Gui's photos on it.

932
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,020
I want to discuss something with you.

933
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,300
You can't take care of him now.

934
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,220
Xia has to take care of you.

935
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,380
A Gui is alone.

936
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,020
Take him back to raise him.

937
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,020
My brother talks to me every day.

938
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,060
When he's better,

939
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,660
I'll send him back.

940
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,460
Okay?

941
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,620
Okay.

942
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,060
Thank you.

943
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,380
You're welcome.

944
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,260
Grandpa.

945
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,780
Are you cold?

946
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,060
I'll close the window.

947
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,020
I won't.

948
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,100
You're not the one

949
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,020
who's been reading the Tangsuyang, right?

950
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,500
I bought it for you.

951
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,700
Do you want to read it now?

952
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,380
Turn it over for me.

953
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,220
Okay.

954
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,660
Turn it over.

955
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,380
Take a bite.

956
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,020
It tastes like the original.

957
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,740
I'll take one.

958
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,900
Then you can cut it into small pieces.

959
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,580
Okay.

960
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,820
I'll cut it into small pieces.

961
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,780
It tastes like the original.

962
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,380
Okay.

963
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,300
Did you hear that?

964
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,340
No, right?

965
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:41,980
Brother Jun.

966
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,900
Put the drinks in these cups later.

967
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,940
You don't know.

968
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,740
The door is broken.

969
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,980
It's hard to pull it.

970
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,060
After closing it,

971
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,700
there's a wide gap.

972
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,100
The rain was heavy yesterday.

973
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,900
It's all coming in from this gap.

974
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,980
It's full of water.

975
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,700
You don't know.

976
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,620
I was busy.

977
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,980
I called again.

978
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,260
I went to answer the phone.

979
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,140
I fell down.

980
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,420
Can you not fall down?

981
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,060
Don't be anxious.

982
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,060
You're old.

983
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:04,700
You're so old.

984
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,460
I'm old.

985
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,700
I'm old.

986
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,860
I'm old.

987
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,060
I'm old.

988
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,580
How was the hospital yesterday?

989
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,460
It was in a line.

990
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,420
The check-up was in a line.

991
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,340
The hospital was in a line.

992
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,540
The money was in a line.

993
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,780
It's raining.

994
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,820
It's a normal hospital.

995
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,340
It's raining.

996
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,060
People will line up to go there.

997
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,140
I'm telling you, Jun.

998
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,500
Luckily, you're not badly injured.

999
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,860
If you're seriously injured,

1000
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,100
I'll be in a headache

1001
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,420
if I go to the hospital every day.

1002
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,980
But you're late for the flight.

1003
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,980
Why didn't you tell him right away?

1004
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,140
The weather is so bad.

1005
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,420
He's afraid you'll get hurt.

1006
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,380
He was so anxious when you called.

1007
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,380
How would I know?

1008
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,260
All right.

1009
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:43,820
Stop talking.

1010
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,340
What's the point of talking now?

1011
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,700
Yes, the doctor said

1012
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,260
he can only rest in peace.

1013
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,500
How would I know?

1014
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,260
He'll be in pain for 100 days.

1015
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,100
Not to mention his age.

1016
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,820
It's time to eat.

1017
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,380
He can't sit down

1018
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,100
or stand up.

1019
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,780
He can't lie down all the time.

1020
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,700
What are you talking about?

1021
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,940
I'm fine.

1022
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,900
It's okay.

1023
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,340
He's exaggerating.

1024
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,340
You eat.

1025
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,420
You eat slowly.

1026
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,700
I'm not hungry.

1027
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,260
I'm telling you.

1028
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,340
It's so hard to see a doctor.

1029
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,540
It takes three hours in a line

1030
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,020
and three minutes to see a doctor.

1031
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,300
It's good for some people

1032
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
to not change jobs.

1033
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,500
I don't want to eat.

1034
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,260
It's so troublesome.

1035
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,180
You're here again.

1036
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,100
You're slandering Chinese medical staff.

1037
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,220
You're not eating with us?

1038
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,220
Let's eat.

1039
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,740
Let's eat.

1040
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:56,740
Here.

1041
00:40:59,260 --> 00:40:59,600
πό

1042
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:00,620
Okay.

1043
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,380
All right.

1044
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,020
Let's get back to work.

1045
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,900
Come here.

1046
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,220
demand

1047
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,020
My mom said

1048
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,260
when you got back to work

1049
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,100
she took care of my mom.

1050
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,260
Where is my dad's store?

1051
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,420
She works for her boss.

1052
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,220
She is arthritis najle сол.

1053
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,260
How could my dad

1054
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,540
is the leader to scar?

1055
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,580
Let me help you.

1056
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,940
You just empty your bag

1057
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,300
then we can change each one.

1058
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,660
All right.

1059
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,500
It's just a Wildlife radius.

1060
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,780
Let's help.

1061
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,660
Let's go.

1062
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,020
Why are you so stubborn?

1063
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,700
I like it.

1064
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,780
What's wrong?

1065
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,020
Why did Director Yu leave the hospital?

1066
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,020
Why are you asking this?

1067
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,340
There must be a reason.

1068
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,340
A person who cares about him

1069
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,780
is very intuitive.

1070
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,820
Then you should ask the person you care about.

1071
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,820
I didn't reply.

1072
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,940
The taste of the cake is different.

1073
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,940
It's almost time.

1074
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,820
I can't eat it.

1075
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,180
It's almost time.

1076
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,340
I have to go.

1077
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,140
I'm going to pick up Yi Yi.

1078
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,260
She's going to study in Africa.

1079
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,260
Didn't Yi Yi study in Russia?

1080
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,900
I remember it wrong.

1081
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,300
You don't care about Yi Yi.

1082
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,540
Yi Yi studied in Africa long ago.

1083
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,140
Right?

1084
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,580
Yes.

1085
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,340
You must have not thought about it.

1086
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:54,860
Liu Jin.

1087
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,380
Yes.

1088
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:56,900
I have something to do.

1089
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,500
What can you do?

1090
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,500
Brother Jun has something to do.

1091
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,700
Why can't I have something to do?

1092
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,900
Well, my mom made a bone soup.

1093
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,940
I'll send it to you later.

1094
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,220
I'm leaving.

1095
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,420
I'm leaving.

1096
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,580
Bye.

1097
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:10,740
Bye.

1098
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,220
Bye.

1099
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,700
You're all leaving.

1100
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,220
Why don't you go?

1101
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,900
I have to stay and help you two.

1102
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,380
I think I can't go to the university.

1103
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,380
What's the condition?

1104
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,020
One week off.

1105
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,140
One month.

1106
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,500
I'm leaving, brother.

1107
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:43,620
Yi Yi.

1108
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,300
I'm leaving.

1109
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,780
Why are you still here?

1110
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,580
It's private time now.

1111
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,020
I want to stay and help.

1112
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,740
Go and clean the table.

1113
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,540
Uncle, you're angry.

1114
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,340
Don't be angry.

1115
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,340
I'll get you a glass of water.

1116
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,220
Go outside and rest.

1117
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:11,740
Can you?

1118
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,740
Rest?

1119
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,140
A broken car goes to the hospital.

1120
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,140
I'll definitely be there.

1121
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:15,820
I'll be there.

1122
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,620
I'll be there.

1123
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,340
I'll be there.

1124
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,940
I'll be there.

1125
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,620
I'll be there.

1126
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,300
I'll be there.

1127
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,060
I'll be there.

1128
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,060
The hospital must be held for more than half an hour.

1129
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,220
I thought you were three hospitals.

1130
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,980
We have a situation today.

1131
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,660
Today's hospital is not enough to team up.

1132
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,180
Look,

1133
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,140
can you please understand our work today?

1134
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,940
We still have more than half an hour to go.

1135
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,540
If it weren't for the vaccine,

1136
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,340
we would have no choice.

1137
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,100
Who would have come to this broken hospital?

1138
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,420
Teaming up?

1139
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,740
I'll kill you.

1140
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,500
Please take a look.

1141
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,460
Sir,

1142
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,260
calm down.

1143
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,340
You're holding the dog.

1144
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,020
I'll find your leader.

1145
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,060
Me.

1146
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,820
I'm the leader of this hospital.

1147
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,180
You can go back to your work

1148
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,180
I'll take care of it

1149
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,180
Okay, Director

1150
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,580
Come to my office

1151
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,700
Please sit down

1152
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,620
Come on

1153
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,300
Have some water

1154
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,060
Here

1155
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,540
My name is Zhou

1156
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,180
You can call me Zhou

1157
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,580
I don't care about your name

1158
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,540
I don't care

1159
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,300
You arrange a tea party

1160
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,620
and have the guests come

1161
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,700
I won't bother you

1162
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,220
Otherwise, I'll go to the police station

1163
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,700
Look, it's like this

1164
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,180
Our hospital

1165
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,260
has a rule

1166
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,100
that we can't line up for more than 15 minutes

1167
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,500
But the situation is special today

1168
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,540
Didn't the little girl

1169
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,780
tell you just now?

1170
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,380
I hope you can understand

1171
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,700
the situation

1172
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,700
more

1173
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,460
after you see the doctor

1174
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,660
What did Luo Li say?

1175
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,580
Are you going to solve it or not?

1176
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,420
I have to

1177
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,980
Do you often see patients?

1178
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:03,900
Yes

1179
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,620
Yes

1180
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,620
Your gums are swollen

1181
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,540
Open your mouth

1182
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,740
Your teeth are a little black

1183
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,820
You don't feel it?

1184
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,500
No

1185
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:19,980
Well

1186
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,380
We arrange a

1187
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,700
oral examination of Sanjia Hospital

1188
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,700
You don't need money

1189
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,860
We can do it for free

1190
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:29,980
What do you think?

1191
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,100
That's good

1192
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,260
Thank you for

1193
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,980
your understanding of our work

1194
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,700
You must go

1195
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,300
Forget it

1196
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,780
We have to make an appointment

1197
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,820
and line up

1198
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:43,700
Don't worry

1199
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,500
We will arrange it for you

1200
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,500
Xiaoyun

1201
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,900
Come to my office

1202
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,060
and check

1203
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,900
the location of the doctor

1204
00:46:58,940 --> 00:46:59,660
Yes

1205
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,100
Well

1206
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,740
Is it a good idea to go to the back door?

1207
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:03,980
Don't misunderstand

1208
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,980
This is a government-led

1209
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,300
cancer screening project

1210
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,700
You can go

1211
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,260
Of course

1212
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,140
It's not that we have to get cancer

1213
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,540
to do this kind of examination

1214
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,100
But people like you

1215
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,420
who often see patients

1216
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,100
should do the examination regularly

1217
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,140
It's like

1218
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,260
a free examination

1219
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:25,860
Come in

1220
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:27,940
Director

1221
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,140
The vaccine is about to be sent to this gentleman

1222
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:30,820
Okay

1223
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:31,580
Well

1224
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,620
You take this gentleman

1225
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,060
to get the child's vaccine

1226
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,300
and take him to the gynecologist

1227
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,220
to register

1228
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,940
and make a oral examination

1229
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,780
of Sanjia Hospital for him

1230
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,020
Director

1231
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,060
Please

1232
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:44,860
Come on

1233
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,260
I'll go and get the real one

1234
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:47,900
Okay

1235
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,980
Take care

1236
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,660
Aunt

1237
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,060
The soup is very good

1238
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,060
I

1239
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,420
Eat

1240
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:11,980
It's a little hot

1241
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:13,660
Let it cool, aunt

1242
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:14,740
It's okay

1243
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:19,340
Okay

1244
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,380
It's okay

1245
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,980
It's still a little hot

1246
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,100
Let me blow it for you

1247
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,380
Aunt

1248
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,460
Have some sugar before you eat

1249
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,020
Here

1250
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,500
Okay

1251
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,580
I'll do it myself

1252
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,340
It's enough

1253
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,980
It's a waste

1254
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,940
Xiaoxu

1255
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:45,580
You

1256
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,780
Go to the bathroom

1257
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,900
I'll have some food

1258
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,380
Go

1259
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,260
You eat first

1260
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:49,980
Then

1261
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,220
You eat first

1262
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,220
One box is enough

1263
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,180
Aunt

1264
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,820
There is orange juice

1265
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,140
If you eat it later, it's salty

1266
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,060
You'll be fine

1267
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,180
Okay

1268
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:04,660
Xiaoxu

1269
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,580
There are melon seeds

1270
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,660
You must try it first

1271
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,940
Don't eat melon seeds

1272
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,500
Go

1273
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,020
Go to the bathroom

1274
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,820
Okay

1275
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:15,940
Aunt

1276
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,580
You're old

1277
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,100
You even gave me a leather

1278
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:19,980
I didn't

1279
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,340
It's the same as when I gave you

1280
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,300
a school-aged book

1281
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,180
when you were a kid

1282
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,900
What time is it now?

1283
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,620
More than two o'clock

1284
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,500
At this time

1285
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,780
I've taken A'gui

1286
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,460
to the tea house in the park

1287
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,540
to have tea

1288
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,100
I played chess with my old brothers

1289
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,780
and talked to them

1290
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,180
Sometimes

1291
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,540
I closed my eyes

1292
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,740
when I was about to talk

1293
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,580
I heard people

1294
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,220
playing the flute in the mountain

1295
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,820
They were playing so well

1296
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,180
Or

1297
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,580
I saw a bunch of old ladies

1298
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,220
dancing in the square

1299
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,940
They had no dance moves

1300
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,020
They had no image

1301
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,780
It's better to be a radio show

1302
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,780
for elementary school students

1303
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,500
Both of them had dropped out of school

1304
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,700
I asked A'gui to come back

1305
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,860
There was a food market

1306
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,540
next to the hospital

1307
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,740
It was hot

1308
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,700
when I got off work at 1 to 5 or 6 o'clock

1309
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,300
You know I'm lazy to cook

1310
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:35,700
I cooked a bowl of rice noodles

1311
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,020
at the rice noodle shop

1312
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,540
The dinner was settled

1313
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,100
If I didn't help you

1314
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,660
Now

1315
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,940
I can barely do it

1316
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,420
It passed so quickly

1317
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,120
ắ��

1318
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,220
nose

1319
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,340
but it didn't go away

1320
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,620
The VISU internet

1321
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,040
is the favorite

1322
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,740
I was crushed by the love

1323
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,340
I'm not lonely anymore.

1324
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,340
I'm not lonely anymore.

1325
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,340
I'm not lonely anymore.

1326
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,340
I'm not lonely anymore.

1327
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,940
I feel good when I'm back.

1328
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,940
I'm not lonely when I'm by your side.

1329
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,540
Thank you, Grandpa.

1330
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,940
You heard that?

1331
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,540
I heard that.

1332
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,340
I heard that.

1333
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,340
I heard that.

1334
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,140
You heard that?

1335
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,540
There are crickets outside.

1336
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,340
How nice it is!

1337
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,940
Tasty jackfruit gonna be very delicious.

1338
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,740
Tran.

1339
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,740
Aunt, you have finished eating them?

1340
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,940
Drink slowly.

1341
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,060
Give me the remote control

1342
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,460
Where is the story?

1343
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,260
It's about the man

1344
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,780
who wanted to revenge his girlfriend

1345
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,380
He found his sister

1346
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,020
who had a car accident

1347
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:47,940
and became her secretary

1348
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,860
And every year

1349
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,180
when his girlfriend had her birthday

1350
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,660
he asked her sister for a year off

1351
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,460
and sent her a postcard from abroad to China

1352
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,340
In the end

1353
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,780
the man used all kinds of means

1354
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,780
to trick his sister's company

1355
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,860
into his own hands

1356
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,820
This man is so cruel

1357
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,300
Xiaoxu

1358
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,620
You can read it yourself

1359
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,660
I'm going in

1360
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,900
Aunt, I'll help you go back

1361
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,020
No, no, no

1362
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:07,820
You read it

1363
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,780
Then be careful

1364
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,020
I'll help Director Yu

1365
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,660
This kid is so mean

1366
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,140
I'll help you

1367
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,580
No, no

1368
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,540
You go and clean the table

1369
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,180
I don't only know how to clean the table

1370
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,260
I can also do other household chores

1371
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:29,140
such as sweeping the floor, mop the floor, and wipe the glass

1372
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,300
If you need anything

1373
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,140
just tell me

1374
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:31,860
I can do it all

1375
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,940
Then why don't I hire an aunt?

1376
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,060
I can make money to support my family

1377
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,180
and share the pressure of life with you

1378
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,660
What do you mean?

1379
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,900
You earn less than me

1380
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,420
At least I can chat with you

1381
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,260
You're not lonely

1382
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,580
You can also chat with me

1383
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,740
with your phone's voice assistant

1384
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,140
It's different

1385
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,140
I have warmth

1386
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,460
I'll keep you company

1387
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,620
Then why don't I want to have a dog?

1388
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,820
Don't just stand here

1389
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,300
Let's go home

1390
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,620
I can still work

1391
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:04,940
I'll mop the floor

1392
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,580
No, no, no

1393
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,420
Then do me a favor, okay?

1394
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:08,940
What?

1395
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,220
Go get the soup

1396
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,300
Not here

1397
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,500
Go to Liu Jin's house to get the soup

1398
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,100
Didn't she say she would send it to you?

1399
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,300
You go get it

1400
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,260
Sister Xiao'nan

1401
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:30,780
Brother

1402
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,380
Sister Shen, a bowl of green sugar rice noodles

1403
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,820
Okay, here it is

1404
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,780
Three bowls of rice noodles with pork

1405
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,500
Mr. Shi also loves this restaurant

1406
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,100
Red and green pork rice noodles with pork

1407
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,140
Sister Shen

1408
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,220
You're early

1409
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,260
What are you having today?

1410
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,620
Fried meat with chili

1411
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,260
Is it good?

1412
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:47,820
Yes

1413
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:48,780
Mr. Zhao

1414
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:49,740
Here it is

1415
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,500
Sister Shen, two bowls of rice noodles with pork

1416
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,260
Okay, sit down

1417
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,540
Two bowls of rice noodles with pork and rice noodles

1418
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,100
Mr. Shi also knows

1419
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,260
these neighbors

1420
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,900
Go ahead

1421
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,820
There is a food street

1422
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,100
There are many good food

1423
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,140
Mr. Shi also loves it

1424
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,860
Through that food street

1425
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,060
we arrived at the river side

1426
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,580
Do you remember the time we met?

1427
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:09,700
We can go for a walk

1428
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,900
when we are free

1429
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,460
Mr. Shi also knows

1430
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,460
the neighborhood street

1431
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,700
Here, rice noodles

1432
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,380
Here it is

1433
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,260
It's home

1434
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,340
You can't miss your meat

1435
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,620
The rice noodles are beautiful

1436
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,540
Go, go, go

1437
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,540
You brought a rice noodle to eat with rice noodles

1438
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:23,580
Go, go, go

1439
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,100
Go, go

1440
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,700
This is delicious

1441
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,060
How about it?

1442
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,340
Let me give you a gift

1443
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,460
How?

1444
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,180
Mr. Shi loves the activity

1445
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,300
I think he can't go out

1446
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,980
You can take him

1447
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,400
to his place

1448
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,700
Take some surroundings

1449
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,580
back and send them to him

1450
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,900
He will like it

1451
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:54,820
Thank you

1452
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,140
happy

1453
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,460
First of all

1454
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,900
The Japanese media courted

1455
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,460
Qin Hao as the author

1456
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,540
Qin Hao

1457
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,900

1459
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,340
I miss you

1460
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,100
Dust off

1461
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,540
I'm so tired

1462
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,540
What?

1463
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,540
Sister, I'm so tired

1464
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,540
Okay, I'm coming

1465
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,540
I'll go get some more

1466
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,540
Okay

1467
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,540
You said you don't eat chili

1468
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,540
Why did you shut up?

1469
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,540
Let's go to the square at 7 o'clock

1470
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,540
I'm so tired

1471
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,540
Sister, I'm going back

1472
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,540
Okay, I'm coming

1473
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,540
Hey, I'm a little bit lost

1474
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,540
I always feel like the day is a little long

1475
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,540
Hey, I'm a little bit flustered

1476
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,540
I'm always afraid that the night will become unsteady

1477
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,540

00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,540
And listen to the heartbeat

1535
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,540
I'm wearing a white shirt

1536
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,540
And listen to the heartbeat

1537
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,540
I'm wearing a white shirt

1538
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,540
And listen to the heartbeat

1539
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,540
I'm wearing a white shirt

1540
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,540
And listen to the heartbeat

1541
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:21,540
I'm wearing a white shirt

1542
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,540
And listen to the heartbeat
