8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Kids, today our parents are going to have a special class

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's the father of my friend Zhang Yiyi

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Doctor Zhang Jun from the community hospital

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Kids, let's give him a round of applause

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I know the design

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I know the design too

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Doctor Zhao Dongcheng is my doctor

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My dad is very familiar with him

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But I didn't see your dad when I was a kid

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Doctor Zhang is different from Doctor Zhao

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He is the director of the hospital

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you the doctor who told people not to let him go to the hospital?

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My grandpa was a hospital doctor

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He cut his stomach

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Your dad is a doctor who is saving your grandpa

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yiyi, have you ever cut someone's stomach?

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Doctor, uncle, have you ever seen anyone who was cut in the tooth?

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Uncle, can you save our little worm?

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Doctor Zhang

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Doctor Zhang

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Doctor Zhang, this way please

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Dad, come on

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't be nervous, this way please

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Just say what you want to say

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
OK

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hello, kids

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hello

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Actually, uncle can't save people

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He can only accompany them to have a rest

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I told you he can't

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He is still young

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He can leave

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He left our son here

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He is like this

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You know

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Dad, mom, the drink is ready

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Thank you

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Thank you

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Sit down

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The painkiller may take some time to work

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You should watch it

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If you feel uncomfortable, you can call me

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And you can't pull out the painkiller

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Sorry for the trouble, doctor

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's our daughter-in-law's fault

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's OK

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why did she run away?

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Sorry, doctor

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We are sorry for the trouble

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You can watch it here

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Call us if you need anything

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
OK

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Thank you

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sister-in-law

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't look for her

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Just go with her

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Dad

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
OK

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's OK

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Bye

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Bye

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Bye

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Sister-in-law

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Where are you going?

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
How can you leave me alone?

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You want to kill my son?

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You know he can't live

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You want to leave him?

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You want to leave?

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You can't eat cake

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You will starve to death

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Stop it

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You take care of your son

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Who are you taking care of your brother?

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Are you blind?

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If he wants to leave, why does he come back?

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Go in

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You, too

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Xiaofeng

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I know

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I take care of him every day

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You are tired

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You are tired

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You want to breathe

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But he is like that

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What if

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What if

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I am afraid

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
you will regret

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You will regret

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You will regret for your whole life

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hello

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Teacher Wu

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't worry about me

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
When I go back

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You can tell me where to change the drawing

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I will change it for you now

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Ok, wait a moment

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Please go to the office of the second room

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
in the first room

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
in the second room

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Xiaoxia

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Please go to the office of the second room

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
in the second room

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Sorry, I will come back later

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Thank you

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Xiaoxia

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You said

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You can take care of your grandpa

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You take care of him like this?

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You hide here and play computer

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and leave grandpa alone?

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Uncle and aunt

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
care about you

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You are like this

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You didn't take care of grandpa

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and you can't do your job well

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Xiaoxia

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Grandpa was sick and hospitalized

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It cost a lot of money

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You are a little girl

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You need to work

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and take care of grandpa

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You can't do this

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
How about

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
you put grandpa's company card

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
in our account

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and all the money

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
will be transferred from us

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You are right

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We are

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
responsible for your burden

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You said

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
managing money and accounting

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
are too troublesome

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ok, ok, ok

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's troublesome

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What did you say?

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Grandpa's medical and nutrition expenses

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
are all my money

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I think so too

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If I, uncle and aunt

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
can split the money

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
it will be better

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Xiaoxia, I am talking about

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
the transfer record

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and the invoice

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I have saved them all

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You need to transfer money

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
or withdraw money today

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's solve this problem

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Ok?

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Or you will be

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
in trouble

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The bank is next door

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Xu Xiaoxia

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No, no, no

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Xiaoxia

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We will talk about this later

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Today

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
we are here to see grandpa

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Now we will go to see grandpa

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We will go now

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hurry up

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What a bad boy

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You are so rude

175
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Why do you talk to him now?

176
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He can't

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
stay with him all the time

178
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
When he goes to work

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
he will blame us

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Go, go, go

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Go, go, go

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The next one is

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
the third competition of the small-scale calculation

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
In the first group

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
the second group

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
wins the second round

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
In this competition

188
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
the four teams

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
will compete in the national team

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He can see it at a glance

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Not good

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Forget it

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I will stay for three months

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Dr. Zhang

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Dr. Zhang, Dr. Zhang

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Did you find anything different

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
tonight?

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What?

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The family of the first bed

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
never called you

201
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
since they came back

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But it seems that

203
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
they changed their mind

204
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
after they ran away

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I think

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
they are not so happy

207
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
after they came back

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They seem to have changed their mind

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Finally, I can work well

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Congratulations, Dr. Zhang

211
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The family of the first bed

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
never called you since they came back

213
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The family of the first bed

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Why are you sitting here?

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's so cold here

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Why don't you go back to the ward?

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I want to sit here for a while

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Where did you go this afternoon?

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Dr. Zhang and I

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
have been looking for you all afternoon

221
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I...

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We went to the ward

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
one by one

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Go back to the ward

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
OK

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Xiaotan

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Xiaotan

228
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Come here

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I want to talk to you

230
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
OK

231
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Go back

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and spend more time with your husband

233
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What's wrong, Dr. Zhang?

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Xiaotan

235
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
An Ning Hospital

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
is a very special place

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The patients here are very painful

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Their families are very fragile

239
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
In fact, what we can do for them

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
is very limited

241
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's just

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
to accompany them

243
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
through this difficult period

244
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Support them

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Encourage them

246
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So when you talk to them

247
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
you must pay attention to the way

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We have to pay attention at any time

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
but we can't bother them too much

250
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Do you understand what I mean?

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I know, Dr. Zhang

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I hope I didn't disturb

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yi Chuang's family just now

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Go back to your work

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'll deal with it

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yi Chuang's family

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Dr. Zhang, what's wrong?

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Come to my office

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I have something to discuss with you

260
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
An Ning

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Hello

262
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The number you have dialed is power off

263
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The number you have dialed is power off

264
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Hello

265
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The number you have dialed is power off

266
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Xiao Xu

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You stay in Zhao Dongcheng's office

268
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I will definitely go to you

269
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Sit down

270
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Are you hungry?

271
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I have some cakes here

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I bought this

273
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
from the convenience store next door

274
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's definitely not as fresh as the cake shop

275
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But it's sweet

276
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It should be delicious

277
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Try it

278
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Dr. Zhang

279
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry

280
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Actually, I want to say

281
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
if you want to eat cake

282
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
it's normal

283
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There's nothing wrong with it

284
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Actually

285
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I want to give a cake to him today

286
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But when I entered the shop

287
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I saw those cakes

288
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and smelled those flavors

289
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I was so hungry

290
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I wanted to sit there

291
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't know what happened to me

292
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I sat there all the time

293
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and ate the whole cake

294
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
one by one

295
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
At that time

296
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I felt alive

297
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Dr. Zhang

298
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
My husband

299
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
How long can he live?

300
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Well

301
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
In your previous hospitals

302
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
there should be a conclusion

303
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I know

304
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I know

305
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I just

306
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I just

307
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Your clothes are dirty

308
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Go back and change your clothes

309
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm sorry

310
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm sorry

311
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm sorry

312
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm sorry

313
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm sorry

314
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm sorry

315
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm sorry

316
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm sorry

317
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm sorry

318
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm sorry

319
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm sorry

320
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm sorry

321
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm sorry

322
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm sorry

323
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry

324
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry

325
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sorry

326
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm sorry

327
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm sorry

328
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm sorry

329
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm sorry

330
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm sorry

331
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry

332
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm sorry

333
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm sorry

334
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm sorry

335
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm sorry

336
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm sorry

337
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm sorry

338
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm sorry

339
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm sorry

340
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm sorry

341
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm sorry

342
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm sorry

343
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm sorry

344
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm sorry

345
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm sorry

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm sorry

347
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm sorry

348
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm sorry

349
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm sorry

350
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm sorry

351
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm sorry

352
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm sorry

353
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm sorry

354
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We've been married for a year and a half

355
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and she's been sick for half a year

356
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I g brainstormed and g看她

357
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,500
to see what she's been through

358
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
what she's been going through

359
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
& Actually

360
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,500
actually I had more unpleasant feelings than she had

361
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
When eating the cakes

362
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I thought

363
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
this cake

364
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
was really bad

365
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But it was so bad

366
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I still didn't want to come back

367
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I thought

368
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I was trapped here every day

369
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I was afraid

370
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I was really afraid

371
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm not a good wife

372
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
She's already like this

373
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But I only think of myself

374
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm just a selfish person

375
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No

376
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You don't have to care too much about others' opinions

377
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What you did for the people you love

378
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
She saw it all

379
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and felt it all

380
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So

381
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You can eat it if you want

382
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You can rest if you want

383
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
If you feel scared

384
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and want to escape

385
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's very normal

386
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You've had a hard time

387
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Zhang

388
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I

389
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I

390
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I

391
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The patient needs company

392
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Maybe the family who is with them

393
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
needs more company

394
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Dr. Zhang said

395
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You have a bad appetite

396
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
and you can't eat

397
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But you'll feel better

398
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
after seeing it

399
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Dr. Luo

400
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Dr. Luo

401
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Wake up

402
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Wake up

403
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Dr. Luo

404
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Doctor

405
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Doctor

406
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Doctor

407
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Doctor

408
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Doctor

409
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What's wrong?

410
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Look

411
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What's wrong with her?

412
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You Tan

413
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Take the doctor out

414
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
She has been rescued so many times

415
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
She will make it this time

416
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Stop

417
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Let her go

418
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Give it back to me

419
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I tell you

420
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm the one who saved my mom

421
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't need you to spend a penny

422
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You were so big when you were young

423
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You saved my mom

424
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't need you to spend a penny

425
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What are you doing now?

426
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
She's lying on the bed now

427
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
She's dying

428
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You still don't save her

429
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Do you know?

430
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You're killing people

431
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You're killing people

432
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Do you know?

433
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Stop talking

434
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Stop talking

435
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You didn't see

436
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
how painful she was

437
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Her stomach

438
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
is so big every day

439
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
She has to excrete as many chickens as possible

440
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The water in her chest

441
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
makes her unable to breathe

442
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
She has to drink water

443
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
She has to drink water

444
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
to breathe

445
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Enough

446
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Enough

447
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Mom

448
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Mom

449
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Mom

450
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Mom

451
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I didn't listen to her

452
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I didn't listen to her

453
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The last time

454
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I came here

455
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
she scolded me

456
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't know what you think of me

457
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
or hate me

458
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I

459
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I want to listen to her

460
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Please

461
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Let her go

462
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
She's too tired

463
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Mom

464
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Mom

465
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Aunt Zhu

466
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Thank you

467
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Please

468
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
take care

469
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Uncle

470
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Uncle

471
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
When she first came

472
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
you said

473
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
it was almost

474
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
a month

475
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Today is

476
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
the 29th day

477
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
She

478
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
is

479
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
satisfied

480
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
29 days

481
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
She has done a lot

482
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
She wants to do

483
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
the first time

484
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
to apply nail oil

485
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
and choose

486
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
the clothes she wants to wear

487
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
and hang the photos

488
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
on the altar

489
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Aunt Zhu

490
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
She's very calm

491
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
She has no regrets

492
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Dr.Zhang

493
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Thank you

494
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Thank you

495
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Really

496
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Thank you

497
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Sister

498
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Brother Jun

499
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Do you know

500
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
what to say

501
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
about the parents' school activity?

502
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We don't know

503
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
what to say

504
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
about our work

505
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I didn't think so

506
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I just want to work hard

507
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
and make money

508
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Make money in the healthiest way

509
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I don't know who

510
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
helped me get into this fire

511
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Who

512
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
is

513
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
knocking on my door?

514
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You have to believe

515
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
that this is the god's will

516
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm just a little push

517
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
behind you

518
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
There is no happiness

519
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
for the princess

520
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's all up to you

521
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
How can there be a reason?

522
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Xiaozi

523
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You are so sensible

524
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Why did you throw the trash

525
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
in the trash can

526
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I didn't throw it

527
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Why did you throw it

528
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
in the trash can?

529
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I didn't throw it

530
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I didn't throw it

531
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Why do you care so much about her?

532
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Let's go

533
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You still don't understand

534
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I told you I didn't throw it

535
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I didn't plan to eat it

536
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I accidentally touched it

537
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
when I was taking other things

538
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You are so sensible

539
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You are so sensible

540
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You are so sensible

541
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You are so sensible

542
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You are so sensible

543
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You are so sensible

544
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You are so sensible

545
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You are so sensible

546
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm talking to you

547
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I can't take it anymore

548
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Goodbye

549
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Some people are just

550
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
being so quiet

551
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
because of some trivial things

552
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Come on

553
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
They are just so happy

554
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
because of some trivial things

555
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
like a fool

556
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Dad

557
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Did you have a good time today?

558
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yes

559
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Dad helped a lot of people

560
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
in his own way

561
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Hello, everyone

562
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Hello, kids

563
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Actually

564
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I can't save people

565
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm just responsible for

566
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
taking a rest with them

567
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Does it mean you will skip school?

568
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm in charge of

569
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
a place called Anning Hospital

570
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
People who come here

571
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
are all those who are seriously ill

572
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and can't be treated

573
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
My job is to accompany them

574
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
to the last step of their life

575
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Don't be afraid

576
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You will die if you fall asleep

577
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
My mom said

578
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
she went to a faraway place

579
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
when she died

580
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Actually

581
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
death is different from falling asleep

582
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's not going to

583
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
any other place

584
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Kids know that

585
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
since the day

586
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
our parents brought us

587
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
to this world

588
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
we all have to experience

589
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
the spring, summer and autumn and winter

590
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
We have to live a wonderful life

591
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and we will all

592
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
reach the end of our lives

593
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And when we reach the end

594
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
we will never hear

595
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
or see anyone

596
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
or touch anything

597
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
But don't be afraid

598
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
The people who died

599
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
didn't leave us

600
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
They just changed

601
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
They will become

602
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
the leaves on the tree

603
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
the wind blowing

604
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and the stars in the sky

605
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
They can be anything

606
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
but not the way

607
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
we are familiar with

608
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
but still by our side

609
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And my job

610
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
is to remind them in time

611
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
apologize in time

612
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
sincerely thank them

613
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and hug them

614
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I will always be there for them

615
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I will always thank them

616
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
and hug them

617
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I will always tell them

618
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
that I love them

619
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and I will always be there for them

620
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and say goodbye to

621
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
all their family and friends

622
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Mom

623
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Mom

624
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Mom

625
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Mom

626
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
How can I be happy in the future?

627
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Experience their feelings

628
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
and accompany them with heart

629
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
This is my job

630
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Dad is so great

631
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Dad is so great

632
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Dad is so great

633
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Dad is so great

634
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Dad is so great

635
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Dad

636
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
will mom and you die?

637
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Of course

638
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
This is the natural law

639
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Everyone will die

640
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So

641
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
we should cherish

642
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
every minute and every second

643
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
when we are with mom and dad

644
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Do you understand?

645
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Dad

646
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I will hug you hard after this

647
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I am late again

648
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I am late again

649
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I am late again

650
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I am late again

651
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I am late again

652
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I am late again

653
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Dad

654
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Mom

655
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Dad

656
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I got it

657
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Let's go

658
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Are you going to die?

659
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I have a stomachache

660
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You go first

661
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
We should talk after you get up

662
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
No

663
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Go if you want to

664
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Call me after you get up

665
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Go if I ask you to go

666
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I can handle it

667
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Can you handle it?

668
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I won't call you then

669
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Hurry up

670
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I ask you to go

671
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,200
You don't want me to go up?

672
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,360
Are you done?

673
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,520
Can you stop blowing?

674
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,120
Hurry up

675
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,480
If you keep being late,

676
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,760
I'll pull my pants

677
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,320
You want me to go up, but you still want to blow

678
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,000
Can you stop being so hard?

679
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,560
Why is this also blocked?

680
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,680
Master Ni, put down your little mule

681
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,960
Come on, get in the car

682
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,240
I'll drive you to work

683
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,640
Enjoy the plan of chatting with Qiu Mo

684
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,160
No need, I don't want to be late

685
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,160
You say it like anyone can be late

686
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,600
Yes

687
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,280
Children

688
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,080
Here

689
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,280
Be careful

690
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,920
Make a good shot

691
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,880
idae

692
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,560
Follow up

693
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,600
Okay

694
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,960
kung

695
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,040
Brother

696
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,320
Brother

697
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,680
Del Grocer

698
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
I'm going to the office.

699
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,120
I'll be there in a minute.

700
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,440
Wenxu,

701
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,600
what's your schedule for the weekend?

702
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Do you have time?

703
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,920
This bastard.

704
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,720
I don't know what he's thinking.

705
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,800
I called him for a long time and he didn't reply.

706
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,640
I know. I'm late for work.

707
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,760
I've already deducted all my money.

708
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,640
Next month, I have to pay for the work.

709
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,440
You can pay in the future.

710
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,120
I'm going to stop here.

711
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,760
Thank you.

712
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,120
What are you doing?

713
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,560
Shaoguan,

714
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,080
Dr. Zhao and I

715
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,720
are old friends.

716
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,600
I'm not good at promoting.

717
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,360
He just came to see me.

718
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,600
He doesn't bother me at all.

719
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,360
Your patient sales department is good.

720
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,640
I'm also a resident of your company.

721
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,000
Shaoguan,

722
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,640
I think you have a good reputation.

723
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,440
You're so young and handsome.

724
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,880
I believe you'll be a good doctor

725
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,480
just like them.

726
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,720
Uncle Yang, I'll do my best.

727
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,560
I'll do my best.

728
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,800
Uncle Yang,

729
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,440
I'll add you on WeChat.

730
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,680
If you need anything,

731
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,160
just send me a message in time.

732
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,840
Okay.

733
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,120
You're old.

734
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,240
You're not old enough.

735
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,760
You're playing with your phone.

736
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,920
Here, let me scan your phone.

737
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,120
Okay.

738
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,400
Let's measure Yang's blood pressure.

739
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,040
Okay.

740
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,600
Yang,

741
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,360
you said you had diarrhea two days ago.

742
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,240
What did you eat?

743
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,400
Nothing.

744
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,720
By the way,

745
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,640
I drank some mung bean soup.

746
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,440
It's hot these days.

747
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,000
Mung bean soup is good for the stomach.

748
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,840
I found the reason why you had diarrhea.

749
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,760
I told you before

750
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,240
that you can't drink too much mung bean soup.

751
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,960
It's not easy for those who are weak

752
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
to drink it.

753
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,120
You're alone at home.

754
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,320
The food is good for you.

755
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,280
Okay, I got it.

756
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,880
One more thing.

757
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,360
Look.

758
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,880
I have to go to another place.

759
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,000
Don't say I don't take care of you.

760
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,800
I don't believe you.

761
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,880
And the test report

762
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,680
and the old rules

763
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,640
will be posted on your WeChat.

764
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,400
No problem.

765
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,160
Okay.

766
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,400
I'll go first.

767
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,920
Take care of Yang.

768
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,080
I'll go first.

769
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,280
Okay.

770
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,000
Bye, Uncle Ying.

771
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,760
Take care.

772
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,800
Okay.

773
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,680
Please get on the bus No. 9

774
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,400
to the bus No. 9.

775
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,200
I'm back.

776
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,000
Please get on the bus No. 9

777
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,840
to the bus No. 9.

778
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,920
Director Zhang.

779
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,720
Five minutes later.

780
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,880
If I remember correctly,

781
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,960
your bonus this month

782
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,160
has been deducted, right?

783
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,640
So,

784
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,400
don't deduct it.

785
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,920
It's not about deducting the bonus.

786
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,440
It's about the attitude of work.

787
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,440
If the attitude is wrong,

788
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,880
how can you do a good job?

789
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,680
Yes.

790
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,880
You're right. I...

791
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,400
Be serious.

792
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,600
Do you think I want to talk about you?

793
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,480
What will the patient think

794
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,160
when he sees this?

795
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,040
How can he trust you?

796
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,440
How can he trust us?

797
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,800
Director, I don't think

798
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,640
we need to go this far.

799
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,120
Let me tell you.

800
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,840
You're already

801
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,360
a backward member of our company.

802
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,360
If you keep doing this,

803
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,040
others will make progress.

804
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,880
You'll be abandoned by others.

805
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,240
No.

806
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,680
Our friendship

807
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,240
is more than friendship.

808
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,320
Good morning, Zhenzhen.

809
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,680
Morning.

810
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,320
Jun.

811
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,360
Did he say something about you?

812
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,240
You must be late.

813
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,720
Look.

814
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,480
Can't you come out earlier?

815
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,880
You didn't have breakfast, right?

816
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,520
Here.

817
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,000
I washed it.

818
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,880
I brought it from home.

819
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,680
Eat one now.

820
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,080
Then, have another one after lunch.

821
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,600
Yi Yi said that this apple is very delicious.

822
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,360
Crispy and sweet.

823
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
Jun, these two apples

824
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,680
were washed from home

825
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,760
and brought to me

826
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,200
by my parents.

827
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,440
But they're not that good.

828
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,800
Jun, sit down.

829
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,440
What?

830
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,200
Sit down first.

831
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,920
What's wrong?

832
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,160
I have to massage you.

833
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,640
No, no.

834
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,120
No.

835
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,920
You're so tired.

836
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
No, no.

837
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,760
I'll leave one for Zhao

838
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,400
for those two apples.

839
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,560
Zhao, don't worry about him.

840
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,360
Everyone who participates in the training has one.

841
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,200
What training?

842
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,000
It's a...

843
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,960
It's a basic training

844
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,120
organized by a institute.

845
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,800
Zhao went.

846
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,440
You went, too.

847
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:25,280
Master Yu went.

848
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,440
But I didn't go.

849
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,160
Maybe you didn't see

850
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:36,800
the message in the group chat.

851
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,280
What group chat?

852
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,200
I didn't see it.

853
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,240
I didn't receive the message.

854
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,600
It's not a very important group chat.

855
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,000
The training didn't teach

856
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,080
anything useful.

857
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,000
You can go back to your work.

858
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,360
Remember to eat the apples.

859
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,240
Wait a minute.

860
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,360
What?

861
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,120
Take these two apples back to Yi Yi.

862
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,640
I'm not qualified to eat apples

863
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,560
if I don't participate in the training.

864
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:00,880
No, no.

865
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,760
You're qualified.

866
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,040
These two apples are not...

867
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,440
And Yi Yi has a box.

868
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,560
Good job, Uncle Yang.

869
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,480
Your catas are very good.

870
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,640
138 for the high intoxication.

871
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,040
80 for razon.

872
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,440
Pe没有许 caffeine

873
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,960
Don't eat sweet food.

874
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,160
All right, have more hot water.

875
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,560
Does anyone have

876
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:31,960
any uncomfortable situation?

877
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,240
No, no.

878
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,040
Okay.

879
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,840
Uncle Yang,

880
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,760
I was wondering

881
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,600
I want to ask you.

882
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,120
Did you take all the photos on the wall?

883
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
Of course.

884
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,480
If Uncle Yang wasn't young,

885
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,680
he wouldn't have been able to afford it.

886
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,560
Maybe

887
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,560
he would have become a great poet.

888
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,000
But I think

889
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,880
these photos

890
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,480
seem to be taken by the same model.

891
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,720
That's my old friend.

892
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,080
He was my first model.

893
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,840
But he passed away a year ago.

894
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,160
This is the last photo

895
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,760
I took for him.

896
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,840
You look so pretty.

897
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,160
Your children must be pretty too.

898
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,080
Look at my photos.

899
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,480
There is no photo of a child.

900
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,800
My wife is not well.

901
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,800
So we don't have a child.

902
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm sorry, Uncle Yang.

903
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,480
We don't care about that.

904
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,040
Let's not talk about that.

905
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,120
Come on, sit down.

906
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,280
Guan,

907
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,400
you looked at the photos carefully.

908
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,480
Did you find anything

909
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,800
special?

910
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,400
I found that

911
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,600
you took these photos

912
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,280
in the same place.

913
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,160
That's right.

914
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,880
This is the place

915
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,960
where I first dated with my wife.

916
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,520
We saw

917
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,920
a river that no one knew.

918
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,280
We slowly

919
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,640
made our way

920
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,200
and built a big platform.

921
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,840
We built a big square.

922
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,920
I promised her

923
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,880
to take photos there every year.

924
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,840
Even if she's not there,

925
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,600
I must go.

926
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,800
Guan,

927
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,360
you looked at the photos carefully.

928
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,040
Are you familiar

929
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,480
with this place?

930
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,120
No.

931
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,760
I just thought of something.

932
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,160
My dad

933
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,320
also likes to take photos with my mom.

934
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,520
Your dad

935
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,520
loves your mom very much, right?

936
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,720
I'm a little ashamed of this.

937
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,240
Although

938
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,240
I love my wife very much,

939
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,320
I have many

940
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,760
hobbies.

941
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,760
Now I think about it.

942
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,240
Our camera world

943
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,680
is far beyond

944
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,200
the world that accompanies her.

945
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,920
If I knew it was like this,

946
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,680
I would have taken the time

947
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,040
to accompany her.

948
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,600
It's not like now

949
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,600
we can only go to a place

950
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,200
and take a walk.

951
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,840
But now

952
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,680
I'm old.

953
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,040
I can't

954
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,240
go there again.

955
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,320
unveil

956
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,040
We forgot to match up

957
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,040
It's time to be gone.

958
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,680
I'm not a little nervous

959
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,560
I'm always afraid that I'll be weak

960
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,640
In the evening, I'm white and clear

961
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,720
The power of my heart

962
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,120
Put love into the blood

963
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,480
Uncle, aunt, we're starting again

964
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,120
Everyone, line up and take your time

965
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,240
Open a dream kitchen

966
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,760
Go on an unforgettable journey

967
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,480
Look at the past

968
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,680
Only for every star

969
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,120
Open a dream kitchen

970
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,560
You're here

971
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,560
So many people

972
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,560
A youthful battle

973
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,440
How long do I have to wait

974
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,960
I should have come later

975
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,920
Light up the light of life

976
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,200
Little girl, you also come to see the recovery class

977
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,880
You're so young

978
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,200
What's wrong with you

979
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,640
My waist is not good

980
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,120
I fell when I was young

981
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,240
I didn't pay attention

982
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,520
Little girl

983
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,720
Sister, she has headphones

984
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,920
How many times have you been here?

985
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,880
Only two or three times

986
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,840
How about you?

987
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,360
I'm almost there

988
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,760
Next

989
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,240
Little girl, can you hear me?

990
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,680
I have something to do at home

991
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,960
Let me do it first, okay?

992
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,840
Aunt, Shijie

993
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,680
Several people in it

994
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,640
Will be done soon

995
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,480
You can go in together later

996
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,600
Wait a minute, don't rush, okay?

997
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,200
Okay

998
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,080
Let's go

999
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,600
Okay

1000
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,920
Look, I told you

1001
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,560
It looks scary to stab the needle in the face

1002
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,000
But it's really nothing

1003
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,040
If you relax a little

1004
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,360
Not so nervous

1005
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,160
Then you will get better faster

1006
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,480
Are you free tomorrow?

1007
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,040
I mean

1008
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,120
If you are free tomorrow

1009
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,720
Come to do the next sleep

1010
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,600
No need to work on Saturday, right?

1011
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,360
Then let's do it at 11.30

1012
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,240
There was no one at that time

1013
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,240
No need to line up

1014
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,000
Just finished it

1015
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,160
Can also make an appointment

1016
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,360
I mean, after you finish it

1017
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,320
You can make an appointment with your friend

1018
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,120
for lunch

1019
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:09,920
Okay

1020
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,320
See you tomorrow

1021
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,200
Bye

1022
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,120
The last batch of flu vaccine

1023
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,360
Has been vaccinated

1024
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,280
But the number is not enough

1025
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
All the old people in Wanhang community

1026
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,920
And two old people in Xinhu

1027
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,920
Have not been vaccinated

1028
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,680
I have reported the number of people in need

1029
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,480
When the vaccine is in place

1030
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,520
I will tell the Pneumothorax

1031
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,320
And ask the colleagues of Pneumothorax

1032
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
To inform the old people in these two communities

1033
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,080
Pneumothorax and Pneumothorax

1034
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,320
Need to communicate well

1035
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,040
Okay

1036
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,760
Director Yu is going to the meeting temporarily

1037
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,200
He has arranged for me

1038
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,000
To notify the vaccination work

1039
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,640
Xia Yu will help me to finish this

1040
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,600
Dr. Shen

1041
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,240
Director

1042
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,400
I didn't expect to be late today

1043
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,000
If I am late, I will be late

1044
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,200
I won't come today

1045
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,600
Dr. Shen, come

1046
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,040
You

1047
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,440
Sit here

1048
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,200
You will sit here

1049
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,440
Every time we have a meeting

1050
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,360
You will sit here

1051
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,640
So that everyone can see you

1052
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,240
Director

1053
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,640
This position is not suitable for you

1054
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,440
It's suitable

1055
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,320
Sit well

1056
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,560
I won't be late in the future

1057
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,440
I won't be late in the future

1058
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,960
I will be the first one to come every day

1059
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,560
I will give all the people in the whole hospital

1060
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,840
A chance to meet you

1061
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,920
All the people in the whole hospital

1062
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,640
As an example

1063
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,480
How about this?

1064
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,560
Okay

1065
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,360
The daily affairs of all departments

1066
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,640
Have been reported

1067
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,560
Finally

1068
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,400
I have one thing to announce

1069
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,760
In order to improve our work efficiency

1070
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,360
The appearance of the hospital

1071
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,760
Safety quality

1072
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,280
From this week

1073
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,080
We will do to all departments

1074
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,800
Organize and review 6S management

1075
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,680
I will be the team leader of 6S

1076
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,720
The vice team leader

1077
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,720
Will be Shen Xinxin and Shen Ningsheng

1078
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,080
Everyone, give a round of applause

1079
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,760
Good

1080
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,480
Good

1081
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,160
Good

1082
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:29,880
Good

1083
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,520
That

1084
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,120
The boxes on the ground

1085
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,320
Can't be put there

1086
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,360
If there is an emergency

1087
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,480
What will happen?

1088
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,640
That

1089
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,360
You have to sort it out

1090
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,080
Can't put it like this

1091
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:57,840
Messy

1092
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,760
People

1093
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,920
I don't want to lie down at night

1094
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,840
It's like

1095
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,880
I haven't changed it

1096
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,720
Right, director?

1097
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,000
That

1098
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,680
These clothes can't be put like this

1099
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,520
Have to stack up

1100
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,440
I don't know who this is

1101
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,400
Ask later

1102
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,240
Hard work

1103
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:14,960
Go on

1104
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,240
Thank you

1105
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,600
Director

1106
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,640
Director

1107
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,120
Chen Yu

1108
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,200
This is Guan Xu's table

1109
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,600
You didn't see him just now

1110
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,360
Where is he?

1111
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,320
He went out for a moment

1112
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,600
He doesn't tell me

1113
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:49,480
That

1114
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,560
Your table is too messy

1115
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,760
Your personal items

1116
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,640
Can't be put together with work items

1117
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,520
And your cup

1118
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,760
Don't you have a cook in this cup?

1119
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,400
Put it in the kitchen

1120
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,360
Can't put it on the table

1121
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,000
But it's different

1122
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,320
Look at you

1123
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,000
It's a mess and it's paper

1124
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,880
This is like when I went to your dorm

1125
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,080
I'll send you something

1126
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,160
There is no place to go

1127
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,240
I said it's not so messy

1128
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,280
I don't want to eat from my place in the future

1129
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,240
Then you don't want to give it to me

1130
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,160
I don't want to eat

1131
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:20,760
Cheng

1132
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,160
Director

1133
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,680
Director

1134
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,680
I'm so proud of you

1135
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,120
Hurry up

1136
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:33,840
Come on

1137
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,520
What do you think I look like now?

1138
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,440
Like

1139
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:39,960
The housekeeper's aunt

1140
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,480
I'm not kidding you

1141
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,720
I'm serious

1142
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,160
I think it's very similar now

1143
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,480
The kind of school you are in

1144
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,720
No need to do the morning exercise

1145
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,080
No need to do the afternoon exercise

1146
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,160
Every class is walking around

1147
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,120
The kind of class leader you check

1148
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:54,720
Do you know

1149
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,600
Yes

1150
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,400
I'm more like the school's aunt

1151
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,360
You are jealous

1152
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,720
I'm trying hard, too

1153
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,520
Look at these things

1154
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,280
So long

1155
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,480
I spent a lot of money

1156
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,560
To memorize the 6S management system

1157
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,280
What is it?

1158
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,560
Cleaning, what is it?

1159
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,320
Office supplies

1160
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,920
It's cleaning, cleaning, cleaning office places

1161
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,600
Dr. Tian

1162
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:17,760
Director

1163
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,600
Thank you

1164
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:19,920
It's okay

1165
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,960
Then let's go to the next classroom

1166
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,520
Let's start with the secret class

1167
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,680
Everyone

1168
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,320
All the files you need to organize

1169
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,640
Can be handed over to Dr. Shen

1170
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,480
Director Hao

1171
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,400
Director Hao

1172
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,360
I did it, director

1173
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,120
Aren't you familiar with the terms?

1174
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,080
Deputy Director Shen

1175
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,600
Four pipes

1176
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,160
You're too much

1177
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,120
Deputy Director Chen, thank you

1178
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,840
Come on, Director Gu

1179
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,200
You're a little too much

1180
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:51,840
Come on

1181
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,640
There's more

1182
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,680
Be careful

1183
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,280
I'll be watching you today

1184
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,520
No, Deputy Director

1185
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,680
You guys

1186
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:01,880
I

1187
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,640
I want a fat sausage

1188
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,320
And then I want a

1189
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:15,920
Flower cake

1190
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,800
Thank you

1191
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,040
Brother Jin

1192
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,800
Don't look, it's okay

1193
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,120
Take it to the training center

1194
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,920
I guess I was scolded by the leader this morning

1195
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,760
Unusual ups and downs

1196
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,920
You're handsome, you're handsome

1197
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,120
What are you talking about?

1198
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,520
By the way

1199
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,520
Did your mom mention Teacher Luo to you recently?

1200
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,400
Her blood pressure is rising again

1201
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,640
High blood pressure is rising

1202
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:45,640
No

1203
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,880
She must be dissatisfied

1204
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,360
With Zhong Rui's new girlfriend

1205
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,960
What are you guys doing on weekends?

1206
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,320
We'll have a rest tomorrow

1207
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,480
We'll be free for a day tomorrow

1208
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,480
What's the schedule for the weekend?

1209
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,200
Is there any place you want to go?

1210
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,040
I'll take you up here

1211
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,600
I have nothing to go

1212
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,800
I'm quite busy at work

1213
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,160
Take a rest, leave me alone

1214
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,800
You're very considerate today

1215
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,520
Can we have a...

1216
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,360
I can't get up

1217
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,480
You can't get up either

1218
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,920
Can you get up?

1219
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,200
I can get up

1220
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,400
Brother Jin

1221
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,280
Can you go back on your plan?

1222
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,520
No, no, no

1223
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,680
I have to take Yi Yi to my grandparents every weekend

1224
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,040
It's always like this, you know

1225
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,840
Mr. Yu, you...

1226
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,840
I'm the same

1227
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,760
What does the same mean?

1228
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,320
Go to the gym at ten o'clock

1229
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,280
Eat a little painting

1230
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,320
Eat a little and accompany your mom

1231
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,200
It's harder to take a rest than to go to work

1232
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:32,960
I'm afraid of talking

1233
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,080
If you guys are like this

1234
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,000
I'll be angry

1235
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,320
Don't tell me about the training

1236
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,760
Every weekend

1237
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,200
You have to arrange the time so slowly

1238
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,880
Don't you know what day tomorrow is?

1239
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,800
Don't you remember?

1240
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,240
What day is tomorrow?

1241
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,240
What day?

1242
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,680
It's your birthday, Brother Jin

1243
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,000
What birthday?

1244
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,600
It's a year of hard work

1245
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,520
Why are you shouting outside?

1246
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,360
Don't touch me

1247
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,640
The director asked us to send him the training materials

1248
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,200
I was already in the group of three people

1249
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,960
this morning

1250
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,160
Didn't you look at your phone?

1251
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,720
I'm looking for it

1252
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,480
Did you see it?

1253
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,760
How can I send it to him?

1254
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,360
You three actually have one

1255
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,560
Is there a group without me?

1256
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:25,960
Sister Liu

1257
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:26,640
Sister Liu

1258
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,720
What are you doing? Wait for us

1259
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,920
Work please

1260
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,320
Work

1261
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,040
Did I speak the wrong language?

1262
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,720
What does that mean?

1263
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,080
You must not know

1264
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:08,640
Such a crazy life

1265
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,600
Let's eat

1266
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,640
Love you.

1267
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,640
I always feel that the day is a bit long

1268
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,640
Hey, I'm a little flustered

1269
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,640
I'm always afraid that the night will become unsteady

1270
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,640
I put on a white shirt

1271
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:00,640
Listen to the heartbeat

1272
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,640
Put love in the blood

1273
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,640
Heal the fragile heart

1274
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,640
Start a dream kitchen

1275
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,640
Walk a unforgettable journey

1276
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,640
Look at the guests and forget

1277
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,640
Just for every shadow

1278
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,640
Start a dream kitchen

1279
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,640
Watch a youthful bloom

1280
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,640
I'm just stubborn

1281
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,640
The light of the moment

1282
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,640
I put on a white shirt

1283
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:56,640
Listen to the heartbeat

1284
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,640
Put love in the blood

1285
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:04,640
Heal the fragile heart

1286
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,640
Start a dream kitchen

1287
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:13,640
Walk a unforgettable journey

1288
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,640
Look at the guests and forget

1289
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,640
Just for every shadow

1290
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:25,640
Start a dream kitchen

1291
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,640
Watch a youthful bloom

1292
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,640
I'm just stubborn

1293
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,640
The light of the moment
