00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm leaving the city long ago, but I have someone who wants to cry for you

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Bro, I've already bought you a new album, and I've already written all the lyrics, don't forget

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No one in the whole world is more excited than them

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm in the high position, I'm familiar with the style

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm the first to wake up in the valley, I'm a newbie, I'm a newbie

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm in the high position, I'm familiar with the style

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm the first to wake up in the valley, I'm a newbie, I'm a newbie

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm in the high position, I'm familiar with the style

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm the first to wake up in the valley, I'm a newbie, I'm a newbie

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm from the end of the QuZiZhou to the Meixi Lake

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
West Coast Menace

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The End

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So many things

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What? You can't put them in?

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So many dried beans and dried chili

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Can you finish them all?

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So many

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The fridge is occupied by the fisherman

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Didn't his sister come back last time?

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
When I fell, she insisted on asking for leave and came back to take care of me

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I said the fisherman was busy these days

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He always makes trouble with his sister

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He even prepares food for his sister

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This girl is the most stubborn in the family

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
She is actually more soft-hearted than anyone

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Xiao Qing, help me up

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll do it

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You do me a favor

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What?

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I want to move the quilt and pillow on the bed back to my room

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Be careful

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
These days, she is afraid that I will get up at night

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So she sleeps with me

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I think she can't sleep well all night

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I told you, daughters are good

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Unlike two stupid men in our family

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You always say that Xiao Shi is not satisfied with this

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's not good

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Look, you are a little stubborn

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You are stubborn this time

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's all her fault

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Which bed?

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The one in the room

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why does Xiao Shi sleep in such a quilt?

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She is not afraid of cold

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But there is a thick bed in the closet

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
How about we change it for her?

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, no, I'll do it

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll do it

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Why are there so many health products?

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
They are imported

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It seems that Xiao Shi cares about herself

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's better to eat something than to eat

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's done

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's done

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Xiao Xu has been standing here for a long time

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He is very good at acting

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you doing?

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Zhao Dongcheng

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Zhao Dongcheng

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Zhao Dongcheng

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Doctor, be careful

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's not raining today

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's go out for a walk

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The doctor said you should rest more

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's raining all the time

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's raining so well

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We can't go out again

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I just can't do it

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't go to the prison

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I need to get some fresh air

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Otherwise, I can't eat

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
OK

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Slow down

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Come on

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How many days have passed?

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I took you out when I was here

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I can tell

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What?

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Zhao Dongcheng's brother

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
must be not capable

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So he took your horse

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You are his leader

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If you don't have any opinions about him

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
he can keep his job

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Am I right?

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You are taking a walk

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Come out for a walk

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Your daughter is so nice

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
She comes out with you

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
She is so nice

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
She is so nice

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Bye

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Bye

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Your grandma is so shy

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
She looks so sad

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I feel embarrassed in front of her

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You should learn from your sister

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You will be more effective when you come back

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Come out

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I am so tired

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I just want to take a walk

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's much better

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But you should be careful

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Go and get something

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Go

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Your daughter is so nice

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
She takes care of you

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She is so filial

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
She is just a little bit capable

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Unlike her sister

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Her sister is busy with work

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
She will come back

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But she didn't come back

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Unlike her

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
she doesn't go to work

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's okay

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Her sister is different

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
She is very busy

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Aunt

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Xiaoxu, you are back

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Aunt, how can you

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
say that to Director Yu?

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
She is very important

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
in our hospital

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And she is the most

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
educated person in our hospital

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
She is always on time

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
She is always on time

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I am not saying that she is bad

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Aunt

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Many people like her

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And she is very valuable

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
to many people

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
in her work

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can't say that

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Aunt

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Why did you tell my mom

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
those things?

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I am telling the truth

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You are very important

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
in our heart

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You are much better than your sister

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You haven't seen her

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Even if I have seen her

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I think you are better than her

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Better than her

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
My sister is beautiful and capable

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
She is more outgoing than me

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
She is always smiling

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
She is always liked by others

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If you meet her

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
you will be able to talk to her

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You are not me

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
How can you know

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
who I can talk to?

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I like people who are not so outgoing

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and not so funny

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You have a special taste

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I have a special taste

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Everyone has different thoughts

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You have a clear preference

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You shouldn't drink from others

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's very attractive

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why is your refrigerator so empty?

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Can you eat anything?

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I am hungry

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
There is rice and soup

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I will cook for you

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You cook?

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
When I was a kid

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
my dad was not at home

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I cooked by myself

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I could cook by myself

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Moreover

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
cooking is not so difficult

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't be relaxed

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I know you don't like green onion

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I learned it from my sister

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I learned everything from her

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I learned everything from her

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I learned everything from her

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But she suddenly

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
learned how to eat green onion

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I can't change it

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's not a problem

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You don't need to change it

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Sister, think about it

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I am not as good as my sister

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
When I was a kid

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
she scored 95 points in the exam

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
She would hold my mom's arm

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and I would talk to her

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Mom, mom

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I scored full marks in the exam

198
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
My mom would be happy to hear it

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But I

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I scored 100 points in the exam

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I didn't know how to say anything

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I would just throw the paper to my mom

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and ask her to sign it

204
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
After a long time

205
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
everyone would get used to it

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
They would think I don't care about anything

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
My mom is the same

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't know when

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But

210
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
no matter what I do

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
she won't be satisfied

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You say you don't care

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
but it doesn't mean you feel bad

214
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't hold back

215
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You have the right to be sad

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It will be over in a second

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It won't hurt, okay?

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Be good

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Be gentle

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Be gentle

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It hurts!

222
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It hurts!

223
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Can you do it?

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Can you be careful?

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sorry, sorry

226
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Let me do it

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It hurts!

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Others may be wrong

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But if you are strong enough

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
you can handle today's problem

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
In the end

232
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
you are still inexperienced

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't cry

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Be careful

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Crying can't solve any problem

236
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If you don't want to be bullied

237
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you have to work harder

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
to adapt to the working environment

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Actually, I just realized

240
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
that my mom was the first one

241
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
who denied me

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
when I was growing up

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
She was a step ahead of everyone

244
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
No matter how hard I try

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
in her eyes

246
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I will always be

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
the little girl who doesn't fight for her life

248
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I am no better than my sister

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Maybe that's why

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I was so eager to prove myself

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I tried my best to learn

252
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
even though I didn't know how to please teachers

253
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
When I was a nurse

254
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I was already

255
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
very well-informed

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I still wanted

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
everyone around me to be satisfied

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But even if I have worked hard

259
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and worked very hard

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
if I did this

261
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
someone would be dissatisfied with it

262
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
All kinds of requirements

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
are far more than my efforts

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's more difficult

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Until one day

266
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I almost didn't even have a chance

267
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
to open my eyes again

268
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
it's good

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Because after the illness

271
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I realized

272
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
that not all efforts

273
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
will be successful

274
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Not everyone

275
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
must be liked by others

276
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If it fails, it fails

277
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The recognition of health

278
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
is meaningless

279
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
in the case of those people

280
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Life

281
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
is not a dead end

282
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Maybe sometimes

283
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
you change a direction

284
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
or take a step back

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
you will find a very

286
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
different world

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
In so many different worlds

288
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
you can always find

289
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
a comfortable and favorite person

290
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I may never be able to

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
be successful in the eyes of my mother

292
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
or in the eyes of the world

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But at least

294
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
in the matter of being myself

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I won't fail again

296
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's good to be yourself

297
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's comfortable to be yourself

298
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Right?

299
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And

300
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm not afraid of failure

301
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm not afraid of failure

302
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Right?

303
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And you are really

304
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
the most capable, the most

305
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
elegant, the smartest, the most beautiful person I've ever met

306
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Enough

307
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Again

308
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You don't need to

309
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
be recognized by others

310
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You are already very good

311
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Thank you

312
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Thank you

313
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's time

314
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I should go

315
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So soon

316
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's still the same time

317
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
See you later

318
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Bye bye

319
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's late

320
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's not the time yet

321
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Xinxin

322
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Call your father

323
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm a pig

324
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I've got all the toys

325
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You can still eat now

326
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Mom

327
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
When you scold me

328
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
don't take it to yourself

329
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Didn't my father disappear?

330
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Disappear?

331
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He disappeared?

332
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He's not safe

333
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He's not seen

334
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He's out every day

335
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You know

336
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
He's now

337
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
the president of the community's committee

338
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The captain of the fitness team

339
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The vice president of the Academy of Sciences

340
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
After 7080

341
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That

342
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That

343
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That party

344
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I can't figure it out

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Who knows what he's doing

346
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll call you later

347
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Forget it

348
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't call him

349
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What if he rings the phone

350
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
and you can't see

351
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
the phone

352
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and you fall

353
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We are still unlucky

354
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yes

355
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You are right

356
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So

357
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Mom

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
From now on

359
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You'll plan for all the future accidents

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Right?

361
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't get me wrong

362
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Mom, don't get me wrong

363
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This is a guarantee

364
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I bought it too

365
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What if one day

366
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
your son loses his labor

367
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'll at least

368
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
feed your parents

369
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Do you have a job now?

370
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You'll get paid for it

371
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Have you collected it?

372
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What about this month?

373
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll go this month

374
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'll go to improve my labor

375
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Mom, I read a note

376
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Look

377
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Look

378
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
As long as you are hospitalized

379
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you'll get paid for it

380
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No

381
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And

382
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Cold and fever

383
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
80% of the documents can be reported

384
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
No

385
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Who doesn't have a cold and fever?

386
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
80% of the money can be reported

387
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
No

388
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No

389
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No

390
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No

391
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll go to my dad

392
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Hey

393
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Where is my phone?

394
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
36

395
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Who is this?

396
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I always pay the price

397
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Your sister is so beautiful

398
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Is she your girlfriend?

399
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No

400
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
No

401
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What a pity

402
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm just gossiping

403
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What's your business?

404
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm going to the market

405
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll send you an apple

406
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
safe and sound

407
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That's my business

408
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Bye

409
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Bye

410
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Is it good?

411
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What did you say to your aunt?

412
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Nothing

413
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
She sent me an apple

414
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You can say safe and sound

415
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Grandpa

416
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I have a gift for you

417
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What's that?

418
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This is the life

419
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
we went to

420
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
in the neighborhood

421
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
of Zhao Dongcheng and me

422
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You

423
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
can't go out now

424
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
but you want to hear

425
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the sound of the window

426
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's too far away

427
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He took me to

428
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
many places you often go

429
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I also remember some

430
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
places you took me to

431
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I've been there before

432
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
When I grew up

433
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I regret not

434
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
coming back

435
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
to this life

436
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
when you were here

437
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Listen

438
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's like you're still

439
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
living in this community

440
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Shan

441
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You've gone so far

442
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Are you tired?

443
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No

444
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
If you're tired

445
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
let go

446
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
No

447
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I won't

448
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Grandpa

449
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You used to

450
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
hold my hand tightly

451
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and say

452
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Xia, we're home

453
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Grandpa is here

454
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Now I'm the one

455
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
holding you tight

456
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
and not letting go

457
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You were naughty when you were a kid

458
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
How can you

459
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
not be arrested?

460
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You quarreled with your parents

461
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
for a few words

462
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and ran away from home

463
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
If I didn't go to

464
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
the place you often go

465
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
grandpa wouldn't have seen you

466
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
They all want me

467
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I can't live without you

468
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I only have you

469
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You can't live without me

470
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There is no

471
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
never-ending night in the world

472
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's like

473
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
everyone

474
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
wants to sit on

475
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
a bus

476
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Some get off the bus first

477
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Some get off later

478
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
As long as we cherish it

479
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
the scenery

480
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
we see in the bus

481
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
is a good journey

482
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Please go to the hospital

483
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Please go to the hospital

484
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Grandpa

485
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Grandpa

486
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Why are you here?

487
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Because dad is in the night shift today

488
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I came with him

489
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
so I want to see grandpa

490
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Come here, come here

491
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Let grandpa see you

492
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Great

493
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Zhang Yiyi

494
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I looked for you everywhere

495
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Why are you here to see grandpa?

496
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I miss grandpa

497
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Do you want to

498
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
perform a show

499
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
for grandpa and sister?

500
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The one I like the most

501
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The one you like the most

502
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Are you ready?

503
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Come on

504
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Welcome, welcome

505
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Come on

506
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I come from the accident

507
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Like a dust

508
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Who can see my weakness

509
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Grateful heart

510
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Thank you

511
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Grateful heart

512
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Is it boiled chicken, spicy chicken

513
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
or fried chicken with ginger?

514
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Xiaoxia

515
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Grandpa will cook for you again

516
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yes

517
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
We will eat chicken today

518
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Great

519
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Put on the fish slices

520
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and pour the red soup

521
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's so delicious

522
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I will have another half a catty of wine

523
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's so bad

524
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You only have this for a few years

525
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You

526
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
are not the same as

527
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
the student Tang Su

528
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I bought it for you

529
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You can have it now

530
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You are welcome

531
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's okay

532
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's okay

533
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Let grandpa go home

534
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I will be with you

535
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Go home

536
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Go home

537
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Come on, come on

538
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Come on, come on

539
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Come on, come on

540
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You are all here

541
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What are you eating?

542
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
A friend

543
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You go, you go

544
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I go to a friend

545
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Are you okay?

546
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Come on, come on

547
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Drink some water

548
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Give it to your mom

549
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I want to drink water

550
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Give it to your mom

551
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Try it

552
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't want to drink water

553
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Don't drink

554
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's delicious

555
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Little friend

556
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Is it delicious?

557
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes

558
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It tastes good

559
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's cheap, you know

560
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yes

561
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
What is this?

562
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Boss, how many days are left?

563
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
One month

564
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Boss, how's business?

565
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I just took a picture of you

566
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm not a good person

567
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You are not a good person

568
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What's wrong?

569
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Is it okay?

570
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It's okay

571
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
He is the face of the new year

572
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm the face of the new year

573
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm the face of the new year

574
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm the face of the new year

575
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm the face of the new year

576
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm the face of the new year

577
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm the face of the new year

578
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This way, this way

579
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Slow down

580
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Take a look

581
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Slow down

582
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Take a look

583
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Slow down

584
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Take a look

585
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000

Lu Cheng

669
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
What else?

670
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'll go back

671
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Teacher Shi, go to the next room

672
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Teacher Shi

673
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I brought the teacher to see you off

674
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Xiao Xu

675
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You have to light three candles every day

676
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
The lights in the house will always be on

677
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's okay

678
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm here

679
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Thank you, auntie

680
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Thank you

681
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Teacher, thank you

682
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Thank you

683
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Has your grandpa made any efforts?

684
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Not yet

685
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Uncle Shen asked me to do this

686
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
He knows

687
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Thank you

688
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'll take care of it

689
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Come on

690
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Aunt, let me help you

691
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Come on

692
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Look, put this

693
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Maybe don't put it in the middle

694
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's convenient for guests to bring it

695
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Okay

696
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
As you wish

697
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Sister

698
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Brother Jing

699
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I love you

700
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Aunt

701
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Come on

702
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Come on

703
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Good boy

704
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Come on

705
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Come on

706
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Who is he?

707
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Your niece looks like you

708
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Aunt

709
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Flower

710
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
No

711
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
This is the money they gave me

712
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I don't know

713
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Xiao Jia

714
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You are late for work as a junior

715
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You can ask the teacher

716
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
If you want to save her, you can ask her

717
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Sister

718
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Sister

719
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Well

720
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Did you say anything when your grandpa died?

721
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Come out and talk

722
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Come on

723
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
No

724
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Did you say anything when your grandpa died?

725
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
If you want to tell me now

726
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Let's go together today, okay?

727
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Xiaoxia

728
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Threaten us

729
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Do you think we will be afraid of you?

730
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
At least we are your uncle and aunt

731
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
How can you talk?

732
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Don't worry

733
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Your surname is Xu, not Shi

734
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You figure it out

735
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You can't do it in one day

736
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
What does it mean?

737
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
What do you mean?

738
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You go back first, okay?

739
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
After I deal with my grandpa's funeral

740
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I will meet you again

741
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Go

742
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We are waiting here

743
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Go

744
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Go

745
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Go

746
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Go

747
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Go

748
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
What a poor girl

749
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Why does she have so many relatives?

750
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
After teacher Shi left

751
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
She is alone

752
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I saw Zhao Dongcheng

753
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Mom

754
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I will go there later

755
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Xiaoxia is a girl

756
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's not convenient

757
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I will go there to help her

758
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
She may not come back tonight

759
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Okay

760
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You should go there to take care of her

761
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yes

762
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I told Liu Jinma

763
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
She will accompany you tonight

764
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
No need

765
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I can't walk

766
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I don't need to bother her

767
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I have told her

768
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I told you to go to the toilet alone at night

769
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
No one helped you

770
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
If you know this

771
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You should have stayed there just now

772
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Why do you come back?

773
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I come back to help you

774
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I don't know you

775
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You can't like others

776
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You are so thin

777
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You can just come here

778
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And help me

779
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's okay

780
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I am old

781
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I don't know when I will be old

782
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But I have this day

783
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I should be clean

784
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I should not bother others

785
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Okay, stop talking nonsense

786
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You have to take care of me and work with Xue

787
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You should take care of yourself

788
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You are so old

789
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Okay, I will stop talking

790
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Your sister is coming back

791
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You can relax when she comes back

792
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Are you afraid of the footsteps?

793
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
No

794
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's so cold

795
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Liu Jinma

796
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I am so tired

797
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
The person who sold you the insurance

798
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Is it Guo Ting?

799
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
What?

800
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
She has been in the hospital last night

801
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Many nurses are talking about her

802
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Don't believe others

803
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Xiaojun, you can go now

804
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Goodbye, uncle and aunt

805
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Goodbye

806
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Don't worry, I am smart

807
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Have you bought it?

808
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Hello

809
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
My friend has something to do at home recently

810
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
We may not see each other for the time being

811
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Let's make an appointment

812
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I am leaving now

813
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You should take it seriously

814
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Dad

815
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Baby, you are awake

816
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I want to walk down by myself

817
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
What?

818
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Are you afraid of me being tired?

819
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I am not tired at all

820
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I will be home soon

821
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Dad

822
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Can you ask for leave tomorrow?

823
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Ask for leave?

824
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Why?

825
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
What are you going to do tomorrow?

826
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Grandma Jin said

827
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Tomorrow is the day of grandpa and aunt

828
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I want to say goodbye to grandpa and aunt

829
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You want to go together?

830
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yes

831
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Okay, I will take you there tomorrow

832
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Everyone wants to sit on a bus

833
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Some people get off first

834
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Some people get off later

835
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Just cherish it

836
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Let's watch the scenery together on the bus

837
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It's a good journey

838
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Are you okay?

839
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I am fine

840
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Give it to me

841
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I will take it off

842
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You go ahead

843
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Jun

844
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
This is a big accident

845
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I think you are the master of the family

846
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You are really a good match

847
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Where is Sun Ye?

848
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Ask him if he is interested

849
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I am not saying anything else

850
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I am just saying

851
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I am just saying

852
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I am just saying

853
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I am just saying

854
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I am just saying

855
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I am just saying

856
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I am just saying

857
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I am just saying

858
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I am just saying

859
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I am not saying anything else

860
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I just want to check

861
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
in case something happens

862
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I need to be safe, right?

863
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Wash the cups together

864
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Okay

865
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Mr. Gu

866
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The cups

867
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Put it here, I will wash it

868
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Thank you

869
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Do you want me to stay tonight?

870
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
No, I can do it myself

871
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I need to get used to it

872
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,840
Okay, thank you, KingThis is because you have been so kind to my tipo

873
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
Goodbye

874
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
Who's next?

875
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,880
You'll continue working

876
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,040
We still have cavalrydio

877
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,840
Wait

878
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,000
Now I feel good

879
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,480
And I understand why Feibiu doesn't want to leave

880
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,600
That's true

881
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,560
Anyway

882
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,520
It's important.

883
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,400
I'm so tired.

884
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,840
What should we have for dinner?

885
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,200
I don't feel like moving.

886
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,480
How's the roast chicken?

887
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,360
I haven't had it for a long time.

888
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,320
It's too spicy.

889
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,200
I don't feel like eating it.

890
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,280
Yi Yi will be with us

891
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,400
after the new job.

892
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,480
He doesn't like to eat that.

893
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,600
I'm tired of it.

894
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,720
Is there any other choice?

895
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,840
Barbecue.

896
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,040
You just finished it yesterday.

897
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,240
I'm on fire.

898
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,080
Think about it.

899
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,120
Why don't you have hot pot?

900
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,160
It's more bitter.

901
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,840
There's no hot pot that tastes good.

902
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,560
And your hot pot tastes too strong.

903
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,160
That's fish powder.

904
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,880
It's a good idea to eat it.

905
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,160
Mr. Shi likes it.

906
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,800
What do you want for dinner?

907
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,080
Roast chicken.

908
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,120
Okay.

909
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,520
Dr. Zhao, you haven't come to work yet?

910
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,240
I'm on duty.

911
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,200
I'm in the office.

912
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,160
Let me see.

913
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,320
You should have come to get the medicine last week.

914
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,040
I met you at the toilet at the door of the toilet yesterday.

915
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,680
How's the blood sugar control?

916
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,280
You just finished the medicine you took.

917
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,320
I was supposed to come to get the medicine last week.

918
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,720
But I got into a car accident.

919
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,080
I was so worried.

920
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,280
I was so worried.

921
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,240
I was so worried.

922
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,200
I was so worried.

923
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,160
I got into a car accident.

924
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,120
You got into a car accident?

925
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,160
Did you get hurt?

926
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,320
It's just a small injury.

927
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,800
A diabetes patient's external injury is especially important.

928
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,000
It's very serious. Let's transfer him to the hospital.

929
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,000
You go to the Central Hospital for a full checkup.

930
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,160
You can get the treatment after you have the prescription.

931
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,400
It's okay. It doesn't affect.

932
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,360
It doesn't affect?

933
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,800
It doesn't affect the anesthesia.

934
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,840
It affects the medicine.

935
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,880
I prescribed you a long prescription.

936
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,400
Take it once every 30 days.

937
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,840
It's 70% off.

938
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,040
You, a diabetes patient,

939
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,080
should take the medicine on time.

940
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,920
Don't take it today. Don't take it tomorrow.

941
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,000
Okay. I will remember it.

942
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,600
I'll give you the prescription if you take the medicine.

943
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,040
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Zhao.

944
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,720
How's your mother's luck?

945
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,200
Her temperature is not bad.

946
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,400
I'm here to see Dr. Guan.

947
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,840
I'm here to see Dr. Guan too.

948
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,680
Dr. Guan. Dr. Guan.

949
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,880
Look at this man.

950
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,800
He's wearing exactly the same as me.

951
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,400
He's always learning from me,

952
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,280
whether he's eating, wearing or using it.

953
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,480
Is it interesting?

954
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,600
Dr. Guan.

955
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,840
I think I'm right about this dress.

956
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,600
It's not his clothes.

957
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,480
He can wear it.

958
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,520
Others can't wear it.

959
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,640
Who's learning from you?

960
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,440
Tell me.

961
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,240
Who's the one who looks good in it?

962
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,120
Who?

963
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,360
Mrs. Zhao.

964
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,120
I remember both of you.

965
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,440
Were you here for a physical examination

966
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,120
and said you wanted to lose weight?

967
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,160
Yes.

968
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,520
I think you've lost weight.

969
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,200
I can see it.

970
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,600
There's a physical exercise car at our door.

971
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,960
Dr. Xia Yun

972
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,120
Take Mrs. Zhao to the reception room

973
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,040
to measure if she's lost weight.

974
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,720
Okay. Thank you.

975
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,960
Mrs. Zhao.

976
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,120
Did you measure your blood pressure last time?

977
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,880
Dr. Zheng prescribed you some medicine.

978
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,680
Yes. Yes.

979
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,160
Let Dr. Chen measure you later

980
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,000
and see how it works.

981
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,560
Okay. Okay.

982
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,440
Right here.

983
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:54,840
Guan.

984
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,080
Thank you for your hard work.

985
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,440
I brought you some oranges.

986
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,200
I just bought them.

987
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,320
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

988
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,800
Thank you.

989
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,000
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

990
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,800
You're welcome.

991
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,520
Guan is getting more and more popular.

992
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,680
How is it?

993
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,120
Are you free this weekend?

994
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,160
What's wrong?

995
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,480
You have a new candidate.

996
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,800
Ms. Zhou.

997
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,560
You're good at studying and working.

998
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,760
The photos

999
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,720
look smart.

1000
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,000
They match your class.

1001
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,200
You're so talented.

1002
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,640
You must find someone smart.

1003
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,160
Ms. Zhou.

1004
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,000
I don't want to get married now.

1005
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,440
Why?

1006
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,200
I have several candidates.

1007
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,240
I'll send you the photos later.

1008
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,280
I'm not kidding.

1009
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,080
I'm serious.

1010
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,040
Why not?

1011
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,160
No.

1012
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,200
I'm going to check WeChat.

1013
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,720
You won!

1014
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,160
You're the best!

1015
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,280
You're the best!

1016
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,240
You're the best!

1017
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,920
You're the best!

1018
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,280
I'm the best!

1019
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,880
You're not the best.

1020
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,160
You don't have a mother.

1021
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,920
Don't lie.

1022
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,440
I don't have a mother.

1023
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,280
Why haven't I seen her?

1024
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,600
Your mother...

1025
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,240
My mother is a great scientist.

1026
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,960
She's a great medicine researcher abroad.

1027
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,200
She can save many people.

1028
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,480
You're so good at making up stories.

1029
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,400
Everything is fake.

1030
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,040
I'm not lying.

1031
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,760
If you don't believe me,

1032
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,000
I'll call my mother right now

1033
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,680
and tell her

1034
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,600
I'm not lying.

1035
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,760
Dong Cheng.

1036
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,520
The lawyer called just now.

1037
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,760
He said that my grandpa's will is fine.

1038
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,080
So I don't have to be afraid of him.

1039
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,680
The lawyer just told me

1040
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,400
to colon the house

1041
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,440
and wrote a name.

1042
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,720
I showed the lawyer

1043
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,560
my real name.

1044
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,240
He changed it to WeChat.

1045
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:47,800
Let's do it again.

1046
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,580
Make a call,

1047
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,720
come here and with his body.

1048
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,240
But, I really want that lie drauf pelen.

1049
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,320
Come on!

1050
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,320
Come on!

1051
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,240

1052
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,240
Thanks

1053
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,880
I'm relieved

1054
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,280
I'm relieved

1055
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,060
What do we do?

1056
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,060
Can you tell me mom's phone number?

1057
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,060
Why do you want mom's phone number?

1058
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:32,060
So I can call mom anytime.

1059
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,060
You can't call mom anytime.

1060
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,060
Mom is working.

1061
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,060
It's not convenient for her to answer.

1062
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,060
Can you call mom now?

1063
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,060
Now?

1064
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,060
You just called mom today.

1065
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:53,060
Mom, dad, what are you doing?

1066
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,060
Call mom, dad.

1067
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,060
Okay.

1068
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,060
I'll send a message to mom now.

1069
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,060
See how convenient it is for her.

1070
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,060
Okay?

1071
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,060
Okay.

1072
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,060
Wait a minute.

1073
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,060
Okay.

1074
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,060
Why do you miss mom so much?

1075
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,060
Have you ever missed me?

1076
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,060
She's back.

1077
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,060
What's up?

1078
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,060
I'm calling her now.

1079
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,060
I'm going to...

1080
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,060
Hello?

1081
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,060
Yiyi wants to talk to you.

1082
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,060
Wait a minute.

1083
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,060
Hello, mom.

1084
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:47,060
I'm going to play badminton with dad now.

1085
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,060
The kindergarten teacher said that

1086
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:53,060
we should play badminton in primary school.

1087
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,060
It can grow taller.

1088
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,060
You can play it well.

1089
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,060
Dad.

1090
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,060
I want to drink yogurt.

1091
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,060
Can you buy me one?

1092
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,060
We'll buy it after you call mom.

1093
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:12,060
Dad, you can buy me one now.

1094
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,060
I want to drink it now.

1095
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,060
Don't run around when you talk to mom.

1096
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,060
Okay.

1097
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,060
Talk to her.

1098
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,060
Uncle Xia.

1099
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,060
Okay.

1100
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,060
Watch the bag for me.

1101
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,060
Go.

1102
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,060
Go.

1103
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,060
Mom, when will you come back?

1104
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,060
You'll see me when you're back.

1105
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:40,060
If you don't come back, you'll grow up.

1106
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,060
Okay.

1107
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,060
I'll listen to dad.

1108
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,060
Bye.

1109
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,060
Mom.

1110
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,060
3143...

1111
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,060
155 3143...

1112
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:02,060
155 3143...

1113
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,060
155 3143...

1114
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,060
Come to me next time.

1115
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,060
Okay. Thank you.

1116
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,060
You're here too.

1117
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,060
Why are you here?

1118
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,060
It's time to go to work.

1119
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,060
I know.

1120
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,060
Come in.

1121
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:37,060
Actually, I've told you everything I should and shouldn't tell you.

1122
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:42,060
And there are so many familiar patients and colleagues around you.

1123
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:46,060
I'm well-groomed in this hospital.

1124
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:49,060
I know you're...

1125
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,060
This is the last time.

1126
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,060
I don't want to waste it.

1127
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,060
I'm not in charge of the surgery today.

1128
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,060
Dr. Liu has good skills.

1129
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:04,060
How about I help you later?

1130
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,060
Dr. Zhang.

1131
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,060
This girl wants to do the surgery.

1132
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,060
Please look forward to it.

1133
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,060
I know.

1134
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,060
Wang Kankan does the surgery.

1135
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,060
Leave it to me.

1136
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,060
Come with me.

1137
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,060
Don't worry.

1138
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,060
I'll go with you.

1139
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,060
Okay.

1140
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,060
Bye.

1141
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,060
Bye.

1142
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,060
Wang Kankan.

1143
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,060
Come on, guys.

1144
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,060
One bowl of chicken soup with rice noodles.

1145
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,060
Okay.

1146
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,060
I'm coming.

1147
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,060
Why do you come to the hospital today?

1148
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,060
I don't know.

1149
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:57,060
I just want to say I want to ask you out for dinner.

1150
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,060
A bowl of rice noodles with rice noodles.

1151
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,060
Is it good?

1152
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,060
Two bowls of chicken soup with rice noodles.

1153
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,060
One bowl of chicken soup with rice noodles.

1154
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,060
I got a call from the lawyer.

1155
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,060
According to the law,

1156
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,060
they can't earn a penny.

1157
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,060
So I don't have to be afraid.

1158
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,060
I won't give up.

1159
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,060
I'll keep this for my grandpa.

1160
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,060
You've told me about it on WeChat.

1161
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,060
One bowl of chicken soup with rice noodles.

1162
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,060
Okay.

1163
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,060
I want to tell you in person.

1164
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,060
I want to hear it in person.

1165
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,060
Do you want to order something else?

1166
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,060
Do you want to go back to the hospital?

1167
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,060
Who do you want to call?

1168
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,060
Let me tell you.

1169
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,060
I also got a call.

1170
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,060
It's from a client of mine.

1171
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,060
He has a new project for me.

1172
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,060
Actually, I didn't plan to start working so soon.

1173
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,060
But I didn't expect this project

1174
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,060
to be the house of my favorite designer.

1175
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,060
So...

1176
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,060
I decided to take it.

1177
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,060
And it's in Xingcheng.

1178
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,060
I want to say this.

1179
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:32,060
I can do this project at home.

1180
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,060
I can make money.

1181
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:38,060
I can stay here for a while.

1182
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,060
Okay.

1183
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,060
I'll go.

1184
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,060
Let's go.

1185
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,060
Here.

1186
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,060
Sit down.

1187
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,060
Take a look.

1188
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,060
Is it okay?

1189
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,060
Do I still have to pay?

1190
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,060
I can do it anytime.

1191
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,060
I'm fine.

1192
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,060
That's it?

1193
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,060
Thank you so much for your support.

1194
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,060
It's nothing.

1195
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,060
By the way,

1196
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,060
we haven't seen each other for a long time.

1197
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,060
How are you?

1198
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,060
Are you free?

1199
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,060
If you can,

1200
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,060
I'll organize it right away.

1201
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,060
I promise you.

1202
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,060
I can tell my classmates

1203
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,060
that you came back from abroad.

1204
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,060
That's okay.

1205
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,060
I'll send you a message

1206
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,060
after I set the time and place.

1207
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,060
By the way,

1208
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,060
didn't we make an appointment to eat noodles?

1209
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,060
Find a suitable time.

1210
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,060
Let's go together.

1211
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,060
Okay.

1212
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,060
I happen to have something

1213
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,060
to talk to you alone.

1214
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,060
Okay, no problem.

1215
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,060
Sorry, Guo Tian.

1216
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,060
I have something to do in the hospital.

1217
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,060
Go ahead.

1218
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,060
I'll go first.

1219
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,060
Okay.

1220
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,060
Take care.

1221
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,060
Okay.

1222
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,060
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

1223
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,060
Bye.
