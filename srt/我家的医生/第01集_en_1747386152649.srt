Thanks for watching

The Princesses

00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,260
I Edit the words in the post-odes

4
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,260
When when I walked to LA

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,780
There was always someone

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,720
есть for you

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,700
Broding gave all he had

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,780
I touched his touch

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:58,040
Used to be my

10
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,080
Who is the one who opened the door of the hospital

11
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,840
The ugly and beautiful aunt or the little ghost of the neighbor

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,520
I'm here, don't worry, he talks a lot

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,280
My house is like a cotton ball and like a river

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,200
The water of the year is not yet over, there is also a big leaf with a white head

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,880
Don't be too consistent with me, don't be too decisive

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,640
The small fish has your alcohol, the name can be resolved

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,480
I haven't heard the song, but I can see it and say it

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,960
The time is up, the number is open

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,680
Kneel on the suit and look at the table, what do you like to eat

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,280
Call a friend and book a seat

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,040
Hurry up and get up, there is a new account tomorrow

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,680
I walked from the end of the Quzi to the Meixi Lake

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,000
West Coast Maniz

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,400
Is there a food stall?

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,520
Is there a food stall?

26
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,120
Is there a public park square KTV?

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,200
It's so close to the sea, I have to use a big data

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,840
Keep the soldiers for a thousand days, use the soldiers at this time

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,160
Brothers and sisters, uncles and uncles

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,840
All move up to catch Yang Jianguo

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,120
I'm leaving, Yang Jianguo is fighting with me

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,960
Let me ask your order first

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
Hurry, hurry

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Easy, work easy

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,200
Where are they

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
Onside Have a meal

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:51,620
Pressed dough with sour

38
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,900
I'm so tired

39
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,060
I'm running away

40
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,620
I'll stop you next time

41
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,620
Don't run away, Lao Zhang

42
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,420
Don't chase me

43
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,740
You're so old

44
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,380
How can you run better than me?

45
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,940
I told you not to chase me

46
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,820
Help me

47
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,620
I'm running away

48
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,620
I'm running away

49
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,180
His name is Yu Shi

50
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,620
He's a cold-faced killer

51
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,260
He can't be bothered

52
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,700
This is Zhang Jun

53
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,180
A super-fresh milk boss

54
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,540
The only normal person among us

55
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,380
Right

56
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,900
This handsome and blushing brother

57
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,700
It's me

58
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,660
This is a look that is not very smart

59
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,060
Actually not very smart

60
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,260
Shen Xingxing

61
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,300
No.6

62
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,780
He's a late man every day

63
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,460
He's so annoying

64
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,420
Sorry, you're late

65
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,140
That's right

66
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,660
We're all doctors

67
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,900
He's wearing white

68
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,500
He's running with time and fighting with the dead

69
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,140
He's a hero who has been injured

70
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,780
He's a talented gold-digger

71
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,900
He's a good doctor

72
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,860
He's a good doctor

73
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,580
He's a normal doctor

74
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,900
I'm a normal doctor

75
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,900
Doctor

76
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,100
Your hands are so professional

77
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,420
You should have done better

78
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,620
What do you think?

79
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,100
I'm a doctor

80
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,540
I'm not a nurse

81
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,580
We're all normal doctors

82
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,300
We're a group of community doctors

83
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,260
Of course

84
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,940
Our job is also very important

85
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,860
For example

86
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,700
Body checkup

87
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,060
This number is wrong

88
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,940
These observe endoscopy

89
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,380
What did you enter into?

90
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,040
I'll say it

91
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,020
The first person to change is

92
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,260
Then you check it

93
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,900
Come and listen to me

94
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,020
Take a deep breath

95
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,980
Be strong

96
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,860
Good

97
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,500
Can you?

98
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,720
戰味

99
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,080
Go and check the next one

100
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,020
But but but

101
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,620
He's a top expert!

102
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,820
His prescription is indeed different from ours.

103
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,020
But the effect is fine.

104
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,820
Can't we just follow the expert's instructions?

105
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,020
That's right!

106
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,020
Look, Dr. Hao is an expert and professor.

107
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,420
He's seen a lot.

108
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,620
To be honest, we're a community hospital.

109
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,620
His account is hard to hang up.

110
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,620
That's right.

111
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,020
Dr. Hao often appears on TV shows.

112
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,220
I've seen every article of Dr. Hao's public account.

113
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
Public account?

114
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,220
That's right.

115
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,220
Director Zhang, you idiot.

116
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
You still have to look at me.

117
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,420
I suggest you go to the upper level hospital to get blood.

118
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,820
You're a community hospital.

119
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,220
You can't even get blood?

120
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,220
I can.

121
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,420
After getting blood, I have to put it on the machine to test it.

122
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,420
There's no such machine in our hospital.

123
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,420
If there's no such machine, you can go and buy it.

124
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,420
Don't you want to spend this money on the residents?

125
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,020
He can't just buy it.

126
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,020
The country has different medical resources for different hospitals.

127
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,020
It has a clear rule.

128
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
You're joking!

129
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,020
We are just doctors.

130
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,020
Director Yu,

131
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,020
why do you keep saying that your patients are not being treated?

132
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,020
There are always people resigning.

133
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,020
In less than three months, there are seven or eight people...

134
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,020
Six.

135
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,020
Five women and one man.

136
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,020
You know it.

137
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,020
Director Yu, I have to criticize you.

138
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,620
There are four men in our hospital.

139
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,420
I finally got a slap in the face.

140
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,020
I even thought of a name.

141
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,620
I called it...

142
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,620
But you made me run away again.

143
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,620
Why can't you keep your patients?

144
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,620
Director, I have a solution to this problem.

145
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,620
Jiaxin.

146
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,620
You scared me.

147
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,220
Then hire three more people.

148
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,220
Increase the number of people in the department and reduce the number of people working.

149
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,620
Director Yu, don't make things difficult for me.

150
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,220
Just one editor.

151
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,220
Just hire one first.

152
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,220
Increase benefits.

153
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,020
Reduce the number of people working.

154
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,020
Make it clear about the scope of work.

155
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,020
Increase the pay for overtime and the proportion of performance.

156
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,020
Anyway, the point is to keep talent.

157
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,020
Okay.

158
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,020
Director Yu.

159
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,020
Director Yu.

160
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,420
I know you've been working hard these days.

161
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,220
Let's think of another way.

162
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,220
Think of another way.

163
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,220
Look, there were some interviews last time.

164
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,220
They were pretty good.

165
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,220
Let them come next year.

166
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,220
Let them all come.

167
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,220
Director's helplessness is not unreasonable.

168
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,220
As you can see, this is the situation in our hospital.

169
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,220
Jingqi is more anxious than the doctor.

170
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,220
Youllin.

171
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,220
Director, it was my fault.

172
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,620
I can control your faith.

173
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,220
This is already my fault.

174
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,220
I don't know what to Do.

175
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,220
And then you justifiably act hastily.

176
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,220
ore andiro Españao

177
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,220
Challenge

178
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,420
Look at your precious son.

179
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,020
Think about it.

180
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,180
At least half of it

181
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,020
is your fault.

182
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,260
Why I'm not late?

183
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,180
I'm telling you, Zhao Wencheng.

184
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,380
I'm so annoyed with you now.

185
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,140
I'm so poor this month.

186
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,100
I heard yesterday that

187
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,300
you checked six patients

188
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,740
for an hour each.

189
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,620
What do you think?

190
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,860
Don't you want to be a musician?

191
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,380
Of course I want to.

192
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,340
I'm late.

193
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,260
I don't want to be a musician.

194
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,460
What can I do?

195
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,380
Let's go to eat.

196
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:34,980
No money.

197
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,420
I'll treat you.

198
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,900
Let's go to eat hot pot.

199
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,580
I heard that a new store is opening.

200
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,940
That store may be good.

201
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,060
I want to try it.

202
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,100
Hello.

203
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,740
Is Zhao Dongcheng here?

204
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,740
Brother Liang, right?

205
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,020
Don't call me at 2 o'clock

206
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,860
every day at noon.

207
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,900
Come to see me at 2 o'clock.

208
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,300
Call me if you need help.

209
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,620
I'm not your patient.

210
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,180
What's the problem?

211
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,300
I'm Guan Shan.

212
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,820
I'm your mother's husband.

213
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,180
I have an important thing.

214
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,140
I want to tell you

215
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,420
that your mother's husband called you.

216
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,700
Your brother Guan Xu

217
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,420
Are you in need of shoes?

218
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,300
No, listen to me.

219
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,060
I can give you ten million or twenty million.

220
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,100
Ten million or twenty million is fine.

221
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,380
If not, I'll build you a villa.

222
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,660
Are you crazy to be my dad?

223
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,100
My dad died ten years ago.

224
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,380
No, Zhao Dongcheng.

225
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,500
Shut up.

226
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,420
Listen to me.

227
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,500
Your brother Guan Xu

228
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,700
will go back in two days.

229
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,300
You must

230
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,140
keep him for me.

231
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,940
Who wants to be your dad?

232
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,900
Insane.

233
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,540
What's his name?

234
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,060
I think his name is Guan Shan.

235
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,940
Guan Shan?

236
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,620
But how did that liar

237
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,900
know you have a brother?

238
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,940
Yes.

239
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,140
And if he's a liar,

240
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,980
why didn't he just say he's your dad?

241
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,220
Instead, he said he's your mother's husband.

242
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,140
He knows your family so well.

243
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,740
Hey.

244
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,020
Who can tell me

245
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,220
what's going on?

246
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,740
I don't understand.

247
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,460
Jun,

248
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,140
Zhao Dongcheng had a brother.

249
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,900
They were parents.

250
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,180
Then Zhao Dongcheng and Zhao Dongcheng

251
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,380
divorced.

252
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,340
He followed his dad.

253
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,700
His brother followed his mom.

254
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,100
They were brothers for over ten years.

255
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,980
Now

256
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,580
his brother suddenly has a stepfather.

257
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,980
He called and said his brother was coming back.

258
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,780
It's so strange.

259
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,740
Are you a liar?

260
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,420
Maybe.

261
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,340
But maybe not.

262
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,100
Did he ask you for money?

263
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,820
No.

264
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,860
Did he ask you for

265
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,820
your account number, password,

266
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,460
ID,

267
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,900
and so on?

268
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,620
No.

269
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,980
He asked for your girlfriend.

270
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,940
You have one.

271
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,580
It's simple.

272
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,780
Just call him back

273
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,860
and ask him about your brother.

274
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,060
If he doesn't answer,

275
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,580
he's a liar.

276
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:51,900
Right.

277
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,100
Call him now.

278
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,500
Call him now.

279
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,300
It's free.

280
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,580
Hello.

281
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,580
The number you dialed is...

282
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,300
A liar?

283
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,340
A liar.

284
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,780
He's a liar.

285
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,740
He's so annoying.

286
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,740
It's too spicy.

287
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,260
I need to answer a call.

288
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,700
Hello.

289
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,500
Dongcheng.

290
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,780
You promised me.

291
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,140
You haven't made up your mind yet.

292
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,180
There are many people

293
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,860
who want to come to our hospital.

294
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,780
I know.

295
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,700
Give me some time to think about it.

296
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,660
I'll contact you

297
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,700
when I have news.

298
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,860
Because I can't leave here.

299
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,300
Think about it.

300
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,140
How many times have you said that?

301
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,940
I'm telling you.

302
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,860
This kind of situation is not for everyone.

303
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,140
I know.

304
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,420
I'll tell you when I have news.

305
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,940
You're here, Dongcheng.

306
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,660
Hello, sister.

307
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,860
You're so happy today.

308
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,020
Hello.

309
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,580
Hello, doctor.

310
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:03,900
Hello.

311
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,340
My blood pressure is 180.

312
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,300
Is this my bad?

313
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,500
I'll get it for you.

314
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,980
Take a look.

315
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,460
Let me see.

316
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,500
Blood pressure is 8.2.

317
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,820
It's a bit high, right?

318
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,580
Your words are so funny.

319
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,460
I can't read it clearly.

320
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,260
Let me read it for you.

321
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,300
The normal oil level is 0.48 to 1.88.

322
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,660
Now it's 1.96.

323
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,780
High density blood pressure is 0.9 to 1.89.

324
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,140
You're at 0.5.

325
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,020
Low density blood pressure

326
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,100
is 0.3 to 3.36.

327
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,060
Now it's 5.36.

328
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,820
It's a bit high, right?

329
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,740
You know it, too.

330
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,420
You controlled it well before.

331
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,060
Yes.

332
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,580
You have a high blood pressure.

333
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,540
You should be discharged from the hospital.

334
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,940
Well, I'll go back.

335
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,860
I'll try my best to let him down.

336
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,820
If you can't control it,

337
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,780
we can help you.

338
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,740
How?

339
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,300
Go to the hospital.

340
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,260
I can't go to the hospital.

341
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,860
I'll go back and take care of myself.

342
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,340
No.

343
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:57,660
Okay.

344
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,300
Then you control it yourself.

345
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,020
I believe you.

346
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,220
I'll call your daughter.

347
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,860
What?

348
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,420
I'm back to normal.

349
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,620
Old man,

350
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,820
open the bill.

351
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,860
Zhou Ying,

352
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,820
it's settled.

353
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,860
Ding,

354
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,420
you must learn from our director Yu.

355
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,260
But I think you're so smart.

356
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,260
I believe you'll be able to do it soon.

357
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,020
Director Yu,

358
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,020
you must treat Ding well.

359
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,620
You must let him feel

360
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,620
the care and care of people

361
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,620
and the team of our community hospital.

362
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,820
The warmth of the family.

363
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,020
Yes.

364
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,060
On the first day,

365
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,660
I'll take you to get familiar with the environment

366
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,860
and our colleagues in the department.

367
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,420
Ding,

368
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,620
you can do it.

369
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,660
Come on.

370
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,420
Come on.

371
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,260
Come on.

372
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,660
Uncle,

373
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,260
your physical examination report is out.

374
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:49,820
Yes,

375
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,260
you need to come and get it yourself.

376
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,220
Why are both of you

377
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,260
having fever and fever?

378
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,820
I'm fine.

379
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,020
What did you say?

380
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,820
Okay, I know.

381
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,620
Zhou Ying,

382
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,820
you're not going to be able to do it.

383
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,460
Okay, I know.

384
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,020
Director,

385
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,820
I have to go to the kindergarten.

386
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,020
I can't go to the court.

387
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,580
Ding,

388
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,660
help me find the materials for the kindergarten.

389
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,220
Okay.

390
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,380
Tian Minglan,

391
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,860
you can go to the medical care of the court for Gao Yang.

392
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,820
Okay.

393
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,620
Ding,

394
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,460
open the computer and help me check the information of this person.

395
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,220
Where's the information?

396
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,980
I'll find it myself.

397
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,860
Ding,

398
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,460
have you learned the report of the trauma?

399
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,660
I'll send you the template later.

400
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,860
I can't record the system.

401
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,460
Ding,

402
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,220
they're busy.

403
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,260
Take your time.

404
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,900
Go and familiarize yourself with the physical examination process with Zhu first.

405
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,700
Take your time.

406
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,060
Change your job.

407
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,260
Please check the history.

408
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,260
Can the person who has a history

409
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,260
get the vaccine?

410
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,060
Uncle,

411
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,700
you go first.

412
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,420
Ding,

413
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,860
you take him to the test center.

414
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,460
Then go to Xiaocheng's place to get the books.

415
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,660
He's too busy there.

416
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,500
Ding,

417
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,860
is Xiaocheng done?

418
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,460
After that, check Ge Liang's information.

419
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,260
I'll go with you.

420
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,660
Check if the appointment with our hospital is on time.

421
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,860
He's already six years old.

422
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,060
Don't call him.

423
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,500
This first-class COVID-19 vaccine

424
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,460
is specifically for children aged six to five years old.

425
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,860
Long-term pancreatic pancreatic pancreatic pancreatic waist?

426
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,100
You're not scaring me, are you?

427
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,460
Auntie,

428
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,220
you really have to pay attention to this.

429
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,260
I'll take the medicine.

430
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,300
Auntie,

431
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,900
we're a patient care center.

432
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,700
I don't take medicine.

433
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,300
I take the medicine of Gao Xue's family.

434
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,260
Auntie,

435
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,060
patient care center is...

436
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,020
Auntie,

437
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,620
we're a data management room.

438
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,660
We can't open the medicine.

439
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,020
You should have told me earlier.

440
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,820
I'll continue.

441
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,380
Okay.

442
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,820
Just say it next time.

443
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,860
I got it.

444
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,060
The tooth hurts a little.

445
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,820
The tooth is a little poisonous.

446
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,580
Hurry up and tell me how many people are here.

447
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,140
Okay.

448
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,940
Auntie,

449
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,940
I'm here to bring you food.

450
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,700
You must be hungry.

451
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,540
You're so old.

452
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,140
Why are you here?

453
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,500
I'm not a child.

454
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,340
No matter how old you are,

455
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,780
I'm still your mother.

456
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,700
Let's eat some porridge.

457
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,940
Sister,

458
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,380
Yang Jian Guo is the one

459
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,060
in charge of the community.

460
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,940
Yes.

461
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,900
Then help me take a look.

462
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,020
Is there any other

463
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,980
residents who registered

464
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,500
and knew him in this area?

465
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,060
Okay, find him.

466
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,940
Send me a message.

467
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,660
Okay, I'll do it.

468
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,780
I'm off work.

469
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,500
I'm leaving.

470
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,180
Kapomei Town

471
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,700
Director is always on time.

472
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,380
I trainings click.

473
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,300
All right, Jun.

474
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,660
I've seen you post for a long time.

475
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,420
You speed up your videos later every day.

476
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,260
My parents and Su Ye's parents

477
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,460
have always been II want to see his children.

478
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,060
Have not seen for a long time.

479
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,740
Jun, your wife got married.

480
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,100
He's not curious.

481
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,540
You're taller and fatter.

482
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,900
If I didn't know you,

483
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,580
I would think you made it up.

484
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,060
Be gentle.

485
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,540
I just bought it when I saw it.

486
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,020
You're wearing so many lobsters.

487
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,700
It's a good thing.

488
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,860
Life needs a sense of ceremony.

489
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,100
You're humorous.

490
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,020
Who's it your turn this month?

491
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,180
You're having dinner with your husband.

492
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,620
How did you arrange it?

493
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,860
Don't look at me.

494
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,140
I take him to eat every time.

495
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,780
This is not hygienic.

496
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
That one is not good.

497
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,180
What about you?

498
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:50,940
Me?

499
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,780
You?

500
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,220
Aren't you the good grandson of Qingshan Green Water?

501
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,420
Aren't you aunt's good friend?

502
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,900
In front of your mom,

503
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,300
I can't call her a good grandson

504
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,380
or a good friend.

505
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,860
I'm her slave.

506
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,860
I can't eat that eel.

507
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,780
This beef.

508
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,660
It's so expensive in the vegetable market.

509
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,540
You still eat it?

510
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,060
This meatball.

511
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,820
That's not good.

512
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,220
What if...

513
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,380
Sit down, slave.

514
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,900
How about I take Yiyi to accompany her?

515
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,180
No.

516
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,780
Don't, don't, don't.

517
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,460
You're too behind-the-scenes.

518
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,220
It's too dangerous to kill the injured.

519
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,180
From blind dates to marriage to giving birth to children

520
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,220
to going to college with children.

521
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,940
She can't do anything.

522
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,980
She's talking about us.

523
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,580
If we can't take image with them,

524
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,340
what are we going to do?

525
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:24,940
Just come back.

526
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,740
All right.

527
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:43,500
1985,

528
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,580
Be pronounced So Prepare for Death

529
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,740
for Zhang Jun conducts an experiment on Ji Yese.

530
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,140
We will test

531
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,300
Why don't you go to bed early?

532
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,460
You don't understand.

533
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,540
Now...

534
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,020
Is it meaningful?

535
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,060
I'm full and I'm not hungry.

536
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,580
Can you go home and call me?

537
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,700
You don't understand.

538
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,220
No, you don't need to be so loud.

539
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,380
What's the point of calling?

540
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,460
I know it.

541
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,660
Now, it's the popular...

542
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,580
You believe me?

543
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,540
Do you understand?

544
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,780
I don't understand.

545
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,500
That's a photo.

546
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,340
You took it in the camera.

547
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,740
I don't know if you can see it.

548
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,500
I only have one.

549
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,980
I don't have many relatives.

550
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,060
These three are my relatives.

551
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,420
But even if I'm with my relatives,

552
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,780
I often feel a little lonely.

553
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,340
Is it high?

554
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,580
No.

555
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,860
I told you.

556
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,420
Actually, I'm almost there.

557
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,620
You have to do as we said.

558
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,420
Do you know?

559
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:45,940
Thank you.

560
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,460
It's okay.

561
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,300
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

562
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,900
Let's eat.

563
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,300
Okay.

564
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,660
Here comes the duck.

565
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,500
Zai,

566
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,660
we'll have roast duck for lunch today.

567
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,020
Stop looking.

568
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,900
Let's eat.

569
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:11,980
Does it smell good?

570
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,460
Yes.

571
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,540
Does it smell good?

572
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,020
Yes.

573
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,620
Give me a piece.

574
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:17,900
No.

575
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,500
No.

576
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,300
Give me a piece.

577
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,100
I have some.

578
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,620
Thank you.

579
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,420
Okay.

580
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,180
Let's go.

581
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,540
Use chopsticks.

582
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,940
The dishes are good.

583
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,340
Uncle Yang.

584
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,620
Let's eat.

585
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,220
Let's eat.

586
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,780
You have such a high blood pressure.

587
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,460
You can't eat these.

588
00:21:59,460 --> 00:21:59,780
It's okay.

589
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,980
I can eat one.

590
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,260
I said I can't eat.

591
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,300
But I can't eat.

592
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,020
Why don't you listen to me?

593
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,820
Why are you so impatient?

594
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,460
Hurry up.

595
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,620
Let's eat rice.

596
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,900
I spent money to buy it.

597
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,380
The rice is empty.

598
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,700
How can I eat?

599
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,380
I think you can go see Mr. Zhou

600
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,860
to tell us all about it.

601
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,420
No.

602
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,300
We have plenty of time.

603
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,780
Don't keep taking things from him.

604
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:28,780
You should go to bed.

605
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,060
I need to think it over.

606
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,660
It makes me want to sleep.

607
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,580
Are you into him?

608
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,540
I did.

609
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,140
You did too?

610
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,060
He made me handsome anyway.

611
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,020
You also got a fever?

612
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,900
Anyway, director Zhou is satisfied.

613
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,580
Good temperament.

614
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,660
It's like our department.

615
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,860
I think it's like our department.

616
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,100
You are so good.

617
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:52,980
Why are you crying?

618
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,620
I found him.

619
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,380
Yang Jian left.

620
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,860
I looked everywhere in the hospital.

621
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,540
But he's not here.

622
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,700
He might have run out.

623
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,940
He ran away.

624
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,300
Come on, help me take this.

625
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,940
Contact the places he often goes to.

626
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,820
See if there are people.

627
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,660
Be careful.

628
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,620
No, it's the seventh time.

629
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,020
He's too cunning.

630
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,980
Boss, did you see Yang Jian?

631
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,580
No.

632
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,780
Go to the lab and find him.

633
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,060
Did you see Yang Jian?

634
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,580
No.

635
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,260
Yang?

636
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,940
No.

637
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,300
No.

638
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,180
Come on, have a look.

639
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,820
Hello.

640
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,260
Is this Yang Jian's daughter?

641
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,300
I'm from the community hospital.

642
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,300
Your father just ran out of our hospital.

643
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
He hasn't come back.

644
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,900
He should be fine.

645
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,860
Don't worry.

646
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,700
The main thing is that

647
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,500
he recently checked all the indicators.

648
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,540
It's not normal.

649
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,540
We're just wondering

650
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,380
if he's eating outside again.

651
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,820
If there's any problem,

652
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,420
or any situation,

653
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,940
we'll talk to him in time, okay?

654
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,300
You're welcome.

655
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,740
Xinlan.

656
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,900
How long do you think you can stay this time?

657
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,060
Three months.

658
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,340
Three months?

659
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,980
You're the one who can stay for more than three days.

660
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,060
Let's make a bet.

661
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,580
Okay.

662
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,380
What?

663
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:06,900
A meal.

664
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,580
A lobster.

665
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,340
Deal.

666
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,540
What are you doing here?

667
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,660
Didn't you say

668
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,180
you can find Yang Jian

669
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,660
by going around the stalls?

670
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,340
Go.

671
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:18,940
Yes.

672
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,420
I'm leaving.

673
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,060
Yang Jian is eating noodles here.

674
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,620
Stop running, Yang.

675
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,460
Don't chase me.

676
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,660
You're old.

677
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,300
You can't run faster than me.

678
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,140
I told you not to chase me.

679
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,500
Then run to my place.

680
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,260
Run to my place.

681
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,700
Yang.

682
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,740
You're so funny, Yang.

683
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,540
You're still running.

684
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,780
I'll do it for you.

685
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,500
Don't pinch my hand.

686
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,340
Eat more.

687
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,460
Hurry up.

688
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,100
Yang.

689
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,460
I'm sorry to bother you

690
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,900
Dad, what's wrong with you

691
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,900
Can you be a little quiet

692
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,780
Don't bother me

693
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,580
I'm going to work

694
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,380
This is not good

695
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,780
I came to the roadside and I'm still in the car

696
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,940
Did they call you

697
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,540
Your sister-in-law is her daughter

698
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:51,980
Hello hello

699
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,820
I'm her doctor

700
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,700
Hello hello

701
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,860
She can't control her mouth wherever she goes

702
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,700
Yes, you talk about your dad

703
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,220
She didn't listen to us many times

704
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,260
She left me for another day today

705
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,060
Then you talk

706
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,780
Call me if you have something

707
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,900
My office is next to it

708
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,900
OK OK OK

709
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,380
Thank you

710
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,180
Thank you

711
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,780
Thank you

712
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,420
Thank you

713
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,260
Thank you

714
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:09,900
Nothing

715
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,540
Thank you

716
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,660
Dad, do you know how busy I am

717
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,700
You have to ask for leave for me

718
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,860
I have two small teams at home

719
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,980
No one cares about the work report

720
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,140
I know i know

721
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,420
My daughter has worked hard

722
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,380
Come and help me put this paper on

723
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,780
I heard that Yang Jian's daughter is here

724
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,060
How do you usually come

725
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:38,900
Yes

726
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,700
I checked Yang's matter

727
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,020
His daughter has not lived here since she got married

728
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,460
Yang came back to live here for the sake of her daughter

729
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,980
She just moved in recently

730
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,100
And she passed away two months ago

731
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,300
She is still at the old house

732
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
It should be a funeral

733
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,900
You said Yang Jian guo

734
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,620
So good at eating

735
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,900
But I can't eat it

736
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
This has to be more

737
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,860
Sister Chun

738
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
Your soy sauce smells more and more fragrant

739
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,580
Is there another recipe

740
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,420
What recipe

741
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,140
Just like what his grandmother did

742
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,780
You said soy sauce is delicious

743
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,940
Yang Jian guo said soy sauce is also delicious

744
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,060
By the way, how is Yang Jian guo

745
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,020
Chasing after

746
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,980
No injury

747
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,260
Then you have to ask Liu Jin

748
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,460
How could it be injured

749
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,300
We are doctors

750
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,260
We all know

751
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:25,620
Sister Chun

752
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,540
Yang Jian guo is not very healthy

753
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,060
He actually can't eat

754
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,340
Something greasy

755
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,300
OK, I remember

756
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,060
Let me ask you

757
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,260
When he came to the store recently to eat noodles

758
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,060
Did you say anything special

759
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,620
Special words

760
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,860
What special words can he say to me

761
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,500
What he told me was

762
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,020
What he did when he was young

763
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,300
He was very naughty when he was young

764
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,380
His mother loves him very much

765
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,500
He said he was very picky when he was young

766
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,300
Just put his mother

767
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,700
Give it to a cook

768
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,820
It seems like he said his mother's soy sauce

769
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,380
Also very good

770
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,300
OK, you guys eat slowly

771
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,020
Thank you

772
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,540
Soy sauce

773
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,660
It's chili sauce

774
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,500
Sister Chun, come and have a bowl of green soup

775
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,300
You want to eat

776
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,180
I know

777
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,820
You can cook more

778
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,460
I know the reason for Yang Jian guo

779
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,860
dad

780
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,300
The doctor said you didn't have dinner today

781
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,660
I don't want to eat

782
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,420
Then you eat this

783
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,820
I brought it from home

784
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,780
dad

785
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,220
I don't think you are

786
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,940
Not listening to the doctor on purpose, right?

787
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,180
dad

788
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,700
I don't think you are

789
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,260
Not listening to the doctor on purpose, right?

790
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,140
Do you miss grandma

791
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,540
I have a question

792
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,460
Your grandma made that soy sauce

793
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,540
Is it particularly delicious

794
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,460
correct

795
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,340
My dad, he likes it

796
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,580
Soy sauce made by my grandma

797
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,420
Those shops eaten at night

798
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,620
There are soy sauce

799
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,780
Tasty

800
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,500
I guess like your grandma's craft

801
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,700
I found her at Sister Chun's

802
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,140
I think the elderly

803
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,340
Also need to care

804
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
Also need to be concerned

805
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,300
You have to take care of the child

806
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,660
Also consider work

807
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,740
Can understand

808
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,220
But he is your father after all

809
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,580
You have time

810
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,900
Communicate with him

811
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,060
Come back to see him

812
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,780
good or not

813
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,340
The doctor told me

814
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,100
You are not actually a talker

815
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,180
Every store you go to

816
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,180
It's because of that store's soy sauce

817
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,740
Made the taste

818
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,540
It's very similar to grandma's

819
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,500
I still remember

820
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,460
Grandma made every time

821
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,740
In the soy sauce

822
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,820
Will put that

823
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,500
Chopped garlic

824
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,820
That taste is better than chili

825
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,860
Jianguo

826
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,860
Did you receive the soy sauce?

827
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,100
Received received

828
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,860
Just received

829
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,180
Have a good meal

830
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,380
Good good good

831
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,420
I know I know

832
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,620
That's it first

833
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,620
It's a little cold these two days

834
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,900
Wear more clothes

835
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,580
When will you come back

836
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,580
Jianguo

837
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
Busy with work

838
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,260
Busy with taking care of children

839
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,300
Children who are busy taking care of children

840
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,220
Life is hard

841
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:42,900
We can't make it

842
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,420
Put parents in first place

843
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,180
Okay, that's it first

844
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,900
I hang up first

845
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,820
Wait, don't go, don't go

846
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,820
This is my mother

847
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,540
Made by myself

848
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,220
Chopped pepper

849
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,380
You all taste it

850
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,100
Thank you

851
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,980
Life is also colorful

852
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,380
We are reluctant to

853
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,980
Leave time to parents

854
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,700
Until one day

855
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,140
You can't see him again

856
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,460
You just realized

857
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,220
The one who has been ignored by himself

858
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,260
Is the one who loves himself most in this world

859
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,460
Hello

860
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,500
The number you dialed is empty

861
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,180
Please call again later

862
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,100
Sorry

863
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,700
The number you dialed does not exist

864
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,340
Please try again later

865
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,940
mom

866
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,300
I miss you

867
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,220
The chili made by this store

868
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,300
It's exactly like what you made

869
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,020
i see

870
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,860
From that day

871
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,540
battled hard

872
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,620
Go find what was originally대� It's easy to get

873
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,020
But found

874
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,140
It's just a brief crisis

875
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,380
missing

876
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,820
Maybe it's the most helpless

877
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,140
Is it emotion

878
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,940
It makes lonely as a shadow

879
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,940
Let's start.

880
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,940
Come, son.

881
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,940
Let's drink.

882
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,940
This is for you.

883
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,940
Drink it.

884
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,940
I wish I could be a child forever.

885
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,940
So I could be loved forever.

886
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,940
I could live without any fear.

887
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,940
I could live without any fear.

888
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,940
I would never feel lonely.

889
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,940
Loneliness...

890
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,940
started from the day I lost my parents.

891
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,940
I regret thinking about it.

892
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,940
If I had said more to him,

893
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,940
he wouldn't have done it this way.

894
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,940
Dad.

895
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,940
I shouldn't have asked.

896
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,940
You said you were causing me trouble.

897
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,940
I...

898
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,940
I don't blame you.

899
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,940
You have your own family.

900
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,940
Your children.

901
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,940
So many things.

902
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,940
Just remember.

903
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,940
The children of the world are the same.

904
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,940
The parents are the same.

905
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,940
Dad.

906
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,940
I'm sorry.

907
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,940
It's comfortable to work one kilometer after work.

908
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,940
It's great!

909
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
That's great.

910
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,940
You can switch to another one.

911
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,940
Why so hard?

912
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,940
Change!

913
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,940
When we were in line,

914
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,940
we didn't even know what screen.

915
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,940
This is the only product.

916
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,940
You didn't tell me that.

917
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,940
Last time,

918
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,940
you never bought it.

919
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,940
I can listen to it.

920
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,940
How can you be such a slangie?

921
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,940
No faster with the toy.

922
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,940
So many years together.

923
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,940
Cl dug your weight.

924
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,940
Where is theある- 칭 figure?

925
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,940
I have never been so comfortable before.

926
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,940
In dramas and films,

927
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,100
They are all taking foreign doctors and emergency doctors.

928
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,180
Who will take doctors from our community?

929
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,100
Don't make it difficult for the screenwriters.

930
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,740
What are we going to shoot with the screenwriters?

931
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,620
Take pictures.

932
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,980
Aunt, what are you looking at today?

933
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,860
Brother, you can't do this.

934
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,500
You have to open the file.

935
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,220
I'll open the file for you.

936
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,900
Hurry up and transfer.

937
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,300
Aunt, your height, weight, age, community,

938
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,140
and your usual disease.

939
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,500
Uncle, look at this side.

940
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,060
Smile.

941
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,660
We'll take a picture to keep it.

942
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,540
Brother, we don't look at the disease here.

943
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,620
We only keep the file.

944
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,580
No.

945
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,340
Is it different from the two of you on my side?

946
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,700
All kinds of uncles and aunts over there

947
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,340
all know each other.

948
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,340
They are all very familiar.

949
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:05,940
Look at each other.

950
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,420
I know.

951
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,420
Good balance.

952
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,100
Be careful.

953
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,900
Be careful.

954
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,140
I heard you.

955
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,340
Please.

956
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,580
Brother.

957
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,500
Is it heavy?

958
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,580
Good balance.

959
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,620
A little more strength.

960
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,500
The position is wrong.

961
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,140
We are all colleagues.

962
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,100
This one.

963
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,220
I fell asleep.

964
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,300
Don't bother him.

965
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,620
The doctors in the community hospital

966
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,620
are like doctors

967
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,020
but not like doctors.

968
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,780
Compared to doctors,

969
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,380
they are more like service industries.

970
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,300
Yes.

971
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,740
Hello, sir.

972
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,740
Hello.

973
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,580
I think you've been staring at me all afternoon.

974
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,740
If you have anything to say,

975
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,940
say it now.

976
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,020
Director Yu.

977
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,500
I've thought about it.

978
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,020
I'd better not do it anymore.

979
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,540
Okay.

980
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,700
Write a book report to me first.

981
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,420
I will explain to the two directors.

982
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,860
The procedures are very simple.

983
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,660
From tomorrow on,

984
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,620
you should not come.

985
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,340
I'm sorry, Director Yu.

986
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,100
I'm sorry.

987
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,820
I'm sorry.

988
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,580
I'm sorry.

989
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,260
I'm sorry.

990
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:30,980
I'm sorry.

991
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,180
I'm sorry, Director Yu.

992
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,500
You're leaving.

993
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,660
Why are you still holding it?

994
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,580
Say it.

995
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,620
I said it.

996
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,140
Don't be angry.

997
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,140
Actually, I've been thinking

998
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,980
about the scope of work in the patient care department.

999
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,340
Why do we have to do everything

1000
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,380
and keep doing it?

1001
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,100
And every day,

1002
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,060
there are so many words to say.

1003
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,260
Can we do things one by one?

1004
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,580
Can we solve the problems one by one?

1005
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,500
I haven't done one thing.

1006
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,380
And another thing is coming.

1007
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,660
My brain is like being cut into eight pieces.

1008
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,260
What I want to do is to cure and save people.

1009
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,060
Instead of dealing with these files

1010
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,580
and physical examination reports every day.

1011
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:10,900
Director Yu,

1012
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,340
you don't know the voices of those aunts.

1013
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:12,820
I...

1014
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,500
I'm sorry, Director Yu.

1015
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,180
I think I said too much.

1016
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,340
It's okay.

1017
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,580
It's normal for you to have these feelings.

1018
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,820
You can understand it.

1019
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,180
Community hospital

1020
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,580
may not be the best choice for medical students.

1021
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,660
But in this world,

1022
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,860
doctors who can bring people back from the death line

1023
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,020
also need doctors like us.

1024
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,460
You guys...

1025
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,780
It's just...

1026
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,820
Doctor,

1027
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,180
are there many people for physical examination today?

1028
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,940
Aunty, you'll come tomorrow.

1029
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,260
Come to me anytime tomorrow.

1030
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,380
Okay, see you tomorrow.

1031
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,660
See you tomorrow.

1032
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,740
Come to me.

1033
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,540
Okay.

1034
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,300
This is the kind of doctor.

1035
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,060
Dr. Zhang.

1036
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,060
Dr. Zhang.

1037
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,460
Sister.

1038
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:15,980
Dr. Zhang.

1039
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,580
You're here.

1040
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,380
You're here.

1041
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,420
You're here.

1042
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,460
This is me.

1043
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,380
A group of ordinary social doctors

1044
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,660
who are neither tall nor short.

1045
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,020
They do some trivial and complicated work every day.

1046
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,540
They can't be handsome

1047
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,740
and bring people back from the death line.

1048
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,380
When it comes to the problem of the hand,

1049
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,980
they can only transfer the patient to a bigger area.

1050
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,980
But we still stick to it.

1051
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,940
Because this is our job.

1052
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,980
And because this is not just a hospital.

1053
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,340
It's a one kilometer away from home.

1054
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,500
A familiar place to rest with people.

1055
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,340
We are here.

1056
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,100
We grow up here.

1057
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,900
This is where we work.

1058
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,700
This is our home.

1059
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,340
Social doctors

1060
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,380
are a group of doctors who are one kilometer away from home.

1061
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,460
Dr. Zhang.

1062
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,900
Your bean curd...

1063
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,060
Add fish, add meat, add meat.

1064
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,620
No need.

1065
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,380
Let's go.

1066
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,740
Let's go to work.

1067
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,900
What do you want to eat?

1068
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,660
I want to eat fried chicken.

1069
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,700
Fried chicken?

1070
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,740
Fried chicken.

1071
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,740
What's that?

1072
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,780
Boss, what's the special?

1073
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,140
Fish soup, beef stew, fried chicken.

1074
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,500
They are all our specialties.

1075
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,100
Fish soup and fish stew.

1076
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,700
Okay, just do it.

1077
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,100
Hurry up.

1078
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,020
Okay.

1079
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,220
Eight.

1080
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,740
Nine.

1081
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,540
Again.

1082
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,140
Dad, the doctor said...

1083
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:58,900
Don't push me.

1084
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,540
...to exercise more.

1085
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,620
It's good for your disease.

1086
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,020
Come on, last one.

1087
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,020
Ten.

1088
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,780
Ten.

1089
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,300
Hurry up.

1090
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,780
Ten.

1091
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,660
That's right.

1092
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,020
Ten.

1093
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,980
What do you mean?

1094
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,060
Didn't I give you a bottle last time?

1095
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,700
I'll give you two bottles.

1096
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,940
You don't have to be so polite.

1097
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,260
I've told you today.

1098
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,380
You can only have five grams a day.

1099
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,060
Control yourself.

1100
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,700
Don't eat too much.

1101
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,980
We've agreed.

1102
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,020
You have to drink more water after eating.

1103
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,540
Drink more water.

1104
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,020
Let's go.

1105
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,420
Thank you.

1106
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:29,700
Let's go.

1107
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,940
Thank you.

1108
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,500
Xiaoli.

1109
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,260
Here.

1110
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,580
Director Yu.

1111
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,460
Zhou Zhirun.

1112
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,660
Did Ding leave?

1113
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,140
Yes.

1114
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,580
He left six days ago.

1115
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,420
He left 12 days ago.

1116
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,540
Yes.

1117
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,300
There are backup people.

1118
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,780
I've re-signed the recruitment notice.

1119
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,940
I've re-signed it.

1120
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,580
No one is in touch yet.

1121
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,180
I don't care.

1122
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,060
You have to find someone for me.

1123
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,100
It's best to be a young man.

1124
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,500
I can't find anyone.

1125
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:01,940
Why are you so...

1126
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,580
I'll give you three days.

1127
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,660
Three days?

1128
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,100
At most a week.

1129
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,220
Within a week,

1130
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,540
if you can't find anyone,

1131
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,620
I'll call your name.

1132
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,860
I'll go to the public health

1133
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,900
speech competition in this district.

1134
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,540
No, Director Zhou.

1135
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,940
You're too cruel.

1136
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,140
I'll find someone for you.

1137
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,140
Oh my god.

1138
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,380
I'll give you a week.

1139
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,260
Or I'll call your name

1140
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,980
to go to the public health speech competition.

1141
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,540
What task did he give you?

1142
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,380
The pretty girl you liked.

1143
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,180
She can't stand it anymore.

1144
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,020
She left again.

1145
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,740
I said she should be in my full class.

1146
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,260
Then you should help me keep her.

1147
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,940
Who can you keep in your class?

1148
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,140
It's too hard.

1149
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,540
Chunni.

1150
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,060
What's wrong?

1151
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,580
I'm in trouble.

1152
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,820
Someone is dead.

1153
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,220
Come here.

1154
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:47,740
Someone is dead.

1155
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,340
Okay, I'll come to you.

1156
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:48,940
Don't worry.

1157
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,820
Okay.

1158
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,220
Dr. Zhao,

1159
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,220
I need you to sign this document.

1160
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:51,660
Give her the money.

1161
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,540
Help me keep the box with you.

1162
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:53,940
Okay.

1163
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,540
Go.

1164
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,260
Dongqing, you're finally here.

1165
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:00,900
Take a look.

1166
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,340
Come on.

1167
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,500
Don't be afraid.

1168
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:02,900
Come on.

1169
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,460
Go.

1170
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,020
Get out.

1171
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,180
Come on.

1172
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,500
Slow down.

1173
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,380
Slow down.

1174
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,020
I'm telling you.

1175
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,740
She didn't fly.

1176
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,220
She didn't drink.

1177
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,100
Everyone, wait.

1178
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,780
She didn't touch it.

1179
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,540
How can I shout?

1180
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,260
Young man.

1181
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,220
Young man.

1182
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,580
Is your ear better?

1183
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,220
Much better.

1184
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,940
Much better?

1185
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,100
Feeling better?

1186
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,180
Better?

1187
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,420
Yes.

1188
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,980
cordial mutas.

1189
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,660
Yes.

1190
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,020
He needs three spots in blood sugar

1191
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,140
and not bought in for long.

1192
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,100
Bleeding causing coma.

1193
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,460
It's same as what you thought.

1194
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,020
Don't worry.

1195
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,140
Look at her.

1196
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,140
When she wakes up

1197
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,580
remember to go down

1198
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,940
and fix her pro ちo PC metabolic system.

1199
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,420
And

1200
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:03,820
the bed.

1201
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,620
I know. I know.

1202
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,660
I know. You can rest.

1203
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,460
Come on.

1204
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,740
Young man.

1205
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,780
You're awake.

1206
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,220
Do you know what's going on?

1207
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,260
I haven't slept enough these days.

1208
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,940
I don't have much time.

1209
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,140
I just passed out.

1210
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,140
You're interesting.

1211
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,060
Do you know what happened just now?

1212
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:40,940
You fell into the powder shop

1213
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,220
and scared the boss.

1214
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,540
Thank you.

1215
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,300
Come on.

1216
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,540
I need to open a case.

1217
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,500
What's your name?

1218
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,780
Guan Xu.

1219
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,420
Guan Xu.

1220
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,380
Guan Xu?

1221
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,620
Listen carefully.

1222
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,740
Your brother Guan Xu

1223
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,180
will be back in two days.

1224
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,460
You must

1225
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,580
keep him

1226
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,100
for me.

1227
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,300
Do you have your ID card?

1228
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,340
In the bottom of the bag.

1229
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,060
In the wallet.

1230
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,620
Guan Xu.

1231
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,980
March 30, 1998.

1232
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,580
I'll put it back for you.

1233
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,300
It's March 30, 1998.

1234
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,860
Where are your parents?

1235
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,540
Give me your parents' phone number.

1236
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,620
No.

1237
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,780
Do you live nearby?

1238
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,060
No phone or parents.

1239
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,940
You don't live nearby.

1240
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,860
Did you have a fight with your parents?

1241
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,500
Hu Jin.

1242
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,500
Did you have a fight with your parents?

1243
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,260
No.

1244
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,380
They're all dead.

1245
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,340
Dead?

1246
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,380
How could they be dead?

1247
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,140
It doesn't matter.

1248
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,580
Doctor.

1249
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,100
If you didn't wear white,

1250
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,700
I would think you were a police officer.

1251
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,940
I'm not feeling well.

1252
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,780
I'm also very uncomfortable and tired.

1253
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,780
Let me finish this bottle of water

1254
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,820
and we'll talk, okay?

1255
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,140
Okay.

1256
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,820
I have something else to do.

1257
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,420
You can hang it here.

1258
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:32,940
Thank you.

1259
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,700
Sleep for a while.

1260
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,300
Xiao Xiao, let me tell you.

1261
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,300
Your vocal data

1262
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,820
is not stable like your index finger.

1263
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,220
If you feel uncomfortable,

1264
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:54,940
I'll call the nurse.

1265
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,500
Okay.

1266
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,460
Sleep here for a while.

1267
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,460
I'll come back after I finish this bottle, okay?

1268
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,500
Thank you.

1269
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,100
Don't you think it's weird?

1270
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,100
Who is that person?

1271
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,580
He's been out and about several times this morning.

1272
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,540
Yeah.

1273
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,900
He didn't even invite us for lunch.

1274
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:20,860
He must have something wrong

1275
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,740
with staying here all the time.

1276
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,140
It's not normal to skip lunch.

1277
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:25,900
Coming.

1278
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:27,580
Zhao,

1279
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:28,940
tell me the truth.

1280
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,460
I can't.

1281
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,300
Who is that person?

1282
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,940
Who? Who is he?

1283
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,380
Guan Xu.

1284
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,780
Guan Xu?

1285
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,860
You haven't seen him for more than ten years?

1286
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,060
No.

1287
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,340
His brother is Zhao Xu Yang.

1288
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,140
I remember him.

1289
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,660
Yes.

1290
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,940
After my parents divorced,

1291
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,300
my mom changed her name to Guan.

1292
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,500
Guan Xu.

1293
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,420
What a coincidence!

1294
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,420
He's really here.

1295
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,300
I don't believe it.

1296
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,580
Sister Chun called me just now

1297
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,540
and said someone fainted.

1298
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,500
Him?

1299
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,420
Did you ask him clearly?

1300
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,380
Are you sure it's him?

1301
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,980
I saw his ID card inside.

1302
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,860
I didn't ask him clearly.

1303
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,700
He said he was uncomfortable.

1304
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,300
I'll ask him after I finish this bottle.

1305
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,820
I didn't tell him I was his brother.

1306
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:15,900
I'm done.

1307
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,180
The director asked me to send a letter.

1308
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,060
You're not smiling, are you?

1309
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,260
I can't smile.

1310
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,220
Come back.

1311
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,340
Come back.

1312
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,180
Don't come back.

1313
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,300
Let me see what you're doing.

1314
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,220
Oh my god.

1315
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,020
Take it off.

1316
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:27,740
If Dr. Zhu sees you,

1317
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,380
she'll scold you.

1318
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,820
You're a love-hate relationship.

1319
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,260
Take it off.

1320
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,780
Wash your mom for me.

1321
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,140
You know my mom for the first time?

1322
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,220
I'll help you.

1323
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:40,780
I'm used to it.

1324
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:41,980
No.

1325
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,420
Watch her for me.

1326
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,500
No problem.

1327
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,020
Liu Jin.

1328
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,460
Send me a manual later.

1329
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,180
Okay.

1330
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,380
Here.

1331
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,020
Here.

1332
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,220
Take it.

1333
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,340
Thank you.

1334
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:08,620
Why are you leaving?

1335
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,620
I've finished my water.

1336
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,780
All your body indicators are unstable.

1337
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:13,900
You may need to be hospitalized.

1338
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,940
Who allowed you to leave?

1339
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,380
I'm not hospitalized.

1340
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,580
Your condition

1341
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,780
is not serious.

1342
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,140
I told you in advance.

1343
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,420
It's a reverse effect.

1344
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,180
You were lucky this morning

1345
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,380
and fell into the powder shop.

1346
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,140
If you fall into a dangerous place,

1347
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,420
who will take responsibility for it?

1348
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,660
I know my own condition.

1349
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,620
I'll tell you.

1350
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,220
That's not what I mean.

1351
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,060
Even if something happens,

1352
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:36,860
if you don't investigate,

1353
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:37,740
our superior will

1354
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,020
investigate us.

1355
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,860
Don't ruin our reputation

1356
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,180
because of your talent.

1357
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,300
Doctor.

1358
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,940
I can't even afford to pay for the hotel.

1359
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,780
Let alone the hospital.

1360
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,060
I'll think of a way for you.

1361
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,300
You can live with me.

1362
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,180
I'm a doctor.

1363
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,140
What are you afraid of?

1364
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,260
I have a new homestay.

1365
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,860
It's close to the hospital.

1366
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,660
So some patients' families

1367
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,460
live with us.

1368
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,140
You can live with me.

1369
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,020
There are two advantages.

1370
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,140
One, you can live in a place.

1371
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,500
Two, if something happens to you,

1372
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,540
I can take care of you.

1373
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,260
Tell me.

1374
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,660
Are you familiar with this place?

1375
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,460
Yes.

1376
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,660
It's not a place

1377
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,860
I don't know.

1378
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,820
I don't know anything.

1379
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,420
Right.

1380
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,540
Do you know who I am?

1381
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,260
I know you.

1382
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,220
I'm Dr. Zhao.

1383
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,220
Look.

1384
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,380
Are you relieved?

1385
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,100
I'm here to find someone.

1386
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,700
If I live with you,

1387
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,140
can you help me find that person?

1388
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:47,980
Sure.

1389
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,300
But you have to pay another fee.

1390
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,060
How much is the accommodation?

1391
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,740
51 yuan.

1392
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:55,580
It's too expensive.

1393
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,540
30 yuan.

1394
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,220
50 yuan.

1395
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:58,940
35 yuan.

1396
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:01,900
51 yuan.

1397
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:03,660
Deal.

1398
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,700
But it's free.

1399
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,340
Okay, no problem.

1400
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,500
I'll take you to see it.

1401
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,940
Okay, let's go.

1402
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,340
Tell me the truth.

1403
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,140
Okay.

1404
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,580
Let's go.

1405
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,060
Our story is about a five-star hotel.

1406
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:22,780
Come in.

1407
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,540
Is there a bathroom?

1408
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,100
Yes.

1409
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,380
I need to use the bathroom.

1410
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,900
I help my friend.

1411
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:35,980
Come in.

1412
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,660
You have so many things.

1413
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,860
It's like a warehouse.

1414
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,940
I came here for a morning exercise.

1415
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,260
I have to clean the room.

1416
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,260
Do you claim that

1417
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,380
your home will be the flat?

1418
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,900
No one Rut 깔�or expand.

1419
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,420
I came here yesterday.

1420
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,300
I'm sorry.

1421
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,220
This is my friend's daughter.

1422
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,540
You saw her in the hospital.

1423
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,780
Come on. Help me put it there.

1424
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,900
You can clean it up first.

1425
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,420
I'll find a place to live.

1426
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:34,940
Stop.

1427
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,300
You go to the toilet first.

1428
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,500
I'll decide after I go to the toilet.

1429
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,140
OK. I'll go to the bathroom first.

1430
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,940
You go to the toilet first.

1431
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,260
I'll decide after I go to the bathroom.

1432
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,460
That's my friend's.

1433
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,940
You saw her in the hospital.

1434
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,620
I'll go to the toilet first.

1435
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,700
She won't live here.

1436
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,500
Hurry up.

1437
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,740
What are you doing?

1438
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,380
You locked the door.

1439
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,380
I'm still inside.

1440
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,460
You're not a bad guy.

1441
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,420
You're a bad guy.

1442
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,460
Let me tell you.

1443
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,220
If you break the law, I'll call the police.

1444
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,340
I'm your brother.

1445
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,100
Let me alone.

1446
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:34,900
Where's my brother?

1447
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,060
Open the door.

1448
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:36,980
I'm your brother.

1449
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,420
I haven't seen my parents for 17 years.

1450
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,020
It's Guang Shan who contacted me.

1451
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,020
Guan Shan.

1452
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,020
Guan Shan.

1453
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,020
Liar!

1454
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,020
I think you two are both liars.

1455
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,020
You two came here together to trick me.

1456
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,020
Guan Shan asked me to keep you here.

1457
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,020
You're not well yet.

1458
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,020
Why don't you stay here?

1459
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,020
I'm not going out.

1460
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,020
Let me out.

1461
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,020
If you don't let me out, I'll call the police.

1462
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,020
I'm telling you, I didn't mean to lock you up.

1463
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,020
If you want to live well, I'll let you out.

1464
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,020
If you don't want to live well, you'll stay in there.

1465
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,020
Look, I don't think you're a good person.

1466
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,020
I'm a good person.

1467
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,020
Do you want to stay in there forever?

1468
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,020
I haven't seen you for more than ten years.

1469
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,020
I don't even know you.

1470
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,020
I'm your brother.

1471
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,020
You're a bad boy.

1472
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,020
You stay in there.

1473
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,020
You stay in there and think slowly.

1474
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,020
What?

1475
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,020
What's wrong with you?

1476
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,020
I don't want to come out even if you knock on the door.

1477
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,020
I'll kick your door.

1478
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,020
Open the door.

1479
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,020
Are you sure it's really your brother?

1480
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,020
How can it be?

1481
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,020
Why did you lock him up in the bathroom?

1482
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,020
How can I not lock him up?

1483
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,020
I'm afraid he'll bite me if I let him out.

1484
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,020
Didn't you say it in a hurry at noon?

1485
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,020
Say hello to each other.

1486
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,020
Say hello and then go your own way.

1487
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,020
I said you did this.

1488
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,020
You did a good job.

1489
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,020
You should come back and let him cook.

1490
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,020
The smell of the house is the strongest smell of the toilet.

1491
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,020
Say something.

1492
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,020
Turn me off.

1493
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,020
Open the door.

1494
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,020
I'm telling you, it's all about your life now.

1495
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,020
You come out and try it.

1496
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,020
Mobile phone, wallet, ID card.

1497
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,020
With these three things,

1498
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,020
he can't go anywhere even if you let him out.

1499
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,020
That seems to be the case.

1500
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,020
The phone is out of battery.

1501
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,020
But this is a little money.

1502
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,020
No sound.

1503
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,020
Do you want to take a look?

1504
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,020
You shout.

1505
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,020
You're looking at me.

1506
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,020
Do you want to take a look?

1507
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,020
Don't look for it. Go and have a look.

1508
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,020
Go and have a look.

1509
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,020
I said how long has your toilet been clean?

1510
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,020
Why is there no sound at all?

1511
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,020
There's really no sound.

1512
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,020
You see,

1513
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,020
you can't see it.

1514
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,020
You can't hear it.

1515
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,020
You can't see it.

1516
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,020
Go and see it.

1517
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,020
Go and see it.

1518
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,020
After you go and see it,

1519
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,020
you can't hear it.

1520
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,020
If you go and see it,

1521
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,020
you can't hear it.

1522
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,020
If you go and see it,

1523
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,020
you can't hear it.

1524
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,020
I have to go and see it.

1525
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,020
What are you doing?

1526
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,020
You're acting with me.

1527
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,020
You're pretending to be dead, right?

1528
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,020
I'm your brother.

1529
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,420
I can't harm you.

1530
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,020
I'll let you out.

1531
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,340
Let's talk about it.

1532
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,180
You liar!

1533
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,380
You liar!

1534
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,020
I...

1535
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:28,140
Ethan, is he about to die?

1536
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,180
It's not like when we were kids.

1537
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,140
I still feel that I need to go take care of them.

1538
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,140
Are you okay?

1539
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,340
Be quiet.

1540
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,340
Be quiet.

1541
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,740
They're just kids.

1542
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,340
They haven't been back for so long.

1543
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,140
Let's go back to their base.

1544
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:49,140
Give them some time to get along.

1545
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,540
And the two brothers have a connection.

1546
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,940
Give them some space.

1547
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,340
We have the space now.

1548
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,140
I don't know how much time it will take.

1549
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,540
I don't know.

1550
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,340
I just want to help them.

1551
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,940
I don't want to go back to the base.

1552
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,460
I want to help them get back together.

1553
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,860
That guy in the sticker.

1554
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,340
That's him.

1555
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,740
That's our youth's Always.

1556
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,420
The end.

1557
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,380
Maybe too passionate?

1558
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,740
It's a big deal.

1559
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,100
Think about it.

1560
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,260
Beef offal,

1561
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,340
grilled beef,

1562
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,540
grilled beef skewers,

1563
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,860
and grilled shrimp.

1564
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,220
Right?

1565
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,140
Let's go.

1566
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:39,340
Go.

1567
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,660
Look, they're all long.

1568
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,300
Hurry up.

1569
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,860
Here.

1570
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,420
How about

1571
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,820
we make an appointment another day?

1572
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,860
What do you think?

1573
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,780
Actually, I think

1574
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,100
it's a bit of a loss

1575
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,100
to have fewer people in front of the stall.

1576
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:54,860
Right.

1577
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,540
More people can order more dishes.

1578
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:58,460
Yes.

1579
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,100
It's okay.

1580
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,140
I'll get you some.

1581
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,700
I'm sure it's not that delicious.

1582
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,140
Roasted cotton candy.

1583
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,540
Liu Jin, let me hold you.

1584
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:06,060
Okay.

1585
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:07,100
Go.

1586
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,100
Mr. Yu.

1587
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:16,980
Whatever you want.

1588
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,420
Go, eat a meal.

1589
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,580
You have to come back early.

1590
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,400
No, fine.

1591
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,300
Don't sound like eating to me.

1592
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,020
Why do you love her?

1593
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,700
Why did you do this?

1594
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,980
Why did you slap her?

1595
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,940
Dad, what made you so upset?

1596
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,780
I fell asleep at the playground this morning.

1597
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,180
I went to the kindergarten with my hands.

1598
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,980
I watched an episode of the animated film.

1599
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,380
Your mom can't go back this time.

1600
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,380
Mom said she can't come back again.

1601
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:53,380
I want to tell you a secret.

1602
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,780
What secret?

1603
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,580
I made a new friend in kindergarten.

1604
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,940
Just..?

1605
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:11,700
I'm wearing a white dress to listen to the heartbeat

1606
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:19,780
I put love in the blood to cure the fragile heart

1607
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:24,380
I set out on a dreamy journey

1608
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:28,260
and took an unforgettable journey

1609
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:32,180
I'm in a hurry but I'm disappointed

1610
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:36,380
I only want every figure to be beautiful

1611
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,340
I set out on a dreamy journey

1612
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:44,380
and watched the youth bloom

1613
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:48,380
I'm so stubborn

1614
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:53,020
that I'll light up the bright future

1615
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:07,180
I'm wearing a white dress to listen to the heartbeat

1616
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:15,780
I put love in the blood to cure the fragile heart

1617
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,860
I set out on a dreamy journey

1618
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:23,780
and took an unforgettable journey

1619
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:28,300
I'm in a hurry but I'm disappointed

1620
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,620
I only want every figure to be beautiful

1621
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:36,540
I set out on a dreamy journey

1622
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:40,540
and watched the youth bloom

1623
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:44,500
I'm so stubborn

1624
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:49,540
that I'll light up the bright future
