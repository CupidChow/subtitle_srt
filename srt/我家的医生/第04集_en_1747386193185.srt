1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,260
Good tomorrow

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,240
A person always bear watch for you in the city

3
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,140
Everyone has fallen for me

4
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,920
Previously written my own dark thread

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,520
Nobody is harder to be patient than them

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,880
A career at this height

7
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,040
Un buliding yourself

8
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,280
The morning hit in school

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,760
ographic

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,440
His phone was pulled over and flew to the toilet

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,440
Not a single one was there

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,120
Who pushed the door open?

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,520
The ugly girl's aunt

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,920
Or the neighbor's little ghost

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,560
I'm the one who can open her mouth

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,360
My house is like a cotton ball and like a river

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,720
The university in the year of the pig

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,240
There is also a big leaf with a white head

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,440
Don't be too taciturn

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,920
Don't be too decisive

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,320
Little Chi has your alcohol

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,680
Only the people can resolve

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,800
I've heard every song

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,560
I saw it and said it

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,920
The night is like a rock

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,040
The watch is open

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,160
Kneel down and put on a suit

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,560
What to eat

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,880
Call a friend

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,240
Set a place and get it right away

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,640
Hurry up and run

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,960
Every day L new number

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,520
I went from the end of the song to the end of the song

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,640
The life in my house is broadcast by Deluxe

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,120
Not all milk is called Deluxe

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,640
There was one guy

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,320
Where is he?

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,600
해신

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
Xiaoguang

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,040
Dragon

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Shcrowd

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Dragon

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,600
Dragon

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,040
Dragon

45
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,840
Dragon

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,280
Dragon

47
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,160
Dragon

48
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,120
Dragon

49
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,540
Smut, gonna CV your love tonight

50
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,340
It's completely money-chęting

51
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:53,280
Go

52
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
I'm sorry

53
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,160
He even sang a song in the empty room

54
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
It's so scary

55
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
I've worked for so many years

56
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
I've never seen this before

57
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
It's so scary

58
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
What are you doing?

59
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
Did you hear that?

60
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Something terrible happened on the second floor last night

61
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Oh my god

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
It's the sound of the door and the high heels

63
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Really?

64
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
How can he hear this?

65
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
He said he could see his child

66
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
playing the slide every day

67
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
But he always looked for the ground

68
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,160
He hugged the child and cried

69
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
What else could he do?

70
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Director, the most important thing is

71
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Listen together

72
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Recently, Ban Yi Bu is always making noise

73
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Then people said

74
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,160
he might not be able to let go of his child

75
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Did you hear that, director?

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Do you know who worked here ten years ago?

77
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
How could I know?

78
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
I

79
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
I

80
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
If this really happened

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
How could I not know?

82
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,160
How could I not have seen it?

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
What a crazy woman!

84
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
She's so crazy

85
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Shen Liu Jin, I'm telling you

86
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
If it weren't for the time

87
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
before you got to work

88
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Be careful

89
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,160
You guys can go do whatever you want

90
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
What's wrong with you?

91
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Pay attention to it

92
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Don't let me hear

93
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Don't let me hear

94
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
this kind of nonsense news

95
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
What does it have to do with me?

96
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
It has nothing to do with you

97
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
It has nothing to do with you

98
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
You know so well

99
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Women talk too much

100
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Good morning

101
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Director Shen, good morning

102
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Good morning, Director Shen

103
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Doctor Shen, you're early today

104
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
I will continue to stay

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
You can rest assured

106
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,160
You've improved quite fast

107
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Do you know

108
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,160
what the 6S management is about?

109
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Learn it well

110
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
I'll ask you later

111
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Okay

112
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Director Zhou

113
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
I'll go to the living room

114
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Okay

115
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Open it

116
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Look at you talking nonsense

117
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Director, what is 6S?

118
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
You don't even know about it?

119
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
You're good at

120
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
making up stories

121
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,160
You're back so early

122
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
I'm going to the living room

123
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Director, don't go

124
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Director Shen

125
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Where are Guan Xu and Ai Jing?

126
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
They haven't come yet?

127
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Isn't Ai Jing back today?

128
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
I saw that the table was not enough

129
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
so I asked Guan Xu to move

130
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
You have to pay attention to the exam

131
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
You can't relax anyone

132
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Well, it's not long

133
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
before you go to work

134
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
I don't think Ai Jing will be here soon

135
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
I see

136
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
By the way, Director Shen

137
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
I have something to tell you

138
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Come to my office

139
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Okay

140
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
I'm so sleepy

141
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Did you take the report last week?

142
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Last week?

143
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
I forgot

144
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
What should I do?

145
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Why didn't you take it?

146
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Sister Zhu, help

147
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
I don't want to go

148
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
I want to sleep

149
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
No

150
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Dr. Guan

151
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Can you do it alone?

152
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
If you can't, ask someone to help

153
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Don't make such a big mistake

154
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Sorry, Director Chen

155
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Dr. Zhao, come on

156
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Help me lift it

157
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Come on, let me do it

158
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
You guys do your work

159
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Okay

160
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Where should I lift it?

161
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
The lumbar spine

162
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Slow down

163
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Slow down

164
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Slow down

165
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
Slow down

166
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Cooperation

167
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
You walked me last night

168
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Why did you take so long?

169
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Did you hear it that morning?

170
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
What?

171
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
The hospital on the second floor

172
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
makes a sound every night

173
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
It hurts

174
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
It hurts

175
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Zhao Dachuan

176
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
You make a sound

177
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
I want to hear it

178
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Why are you here?

179
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
I don't want to sleep

180
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Where am I?

181
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
You know

182
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
I'm so sleepy

183
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
I'm so sleepy

184
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
I'm so sleepy

185
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
I'm so sleepy

186
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
I heard a sound

187
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
It's a woman singing

188
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
You scared me

189
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Stop it

190
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
It's not scary

191
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,160
There's always a sound

192
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Brother

193
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
What are you talking about?

194
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
I heard it from Director Yu

195
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
As long as it's not Director Chen

196
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Sit down

197
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Let's have lunch at 6 p.m.

198
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
You eat

199
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
You eat too

200
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Let's have lunch at 6 p.m.

201
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
I'm not going

202
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
I have to work in the afternoon

203
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
I'm eating in the canteen

204
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
You're so positive

205
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
What are you doing?

206
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
It's time to start work

207
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I didn't say I wouldn't start work

208
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
You're so free

209
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Who's free?

210
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Director, please

211
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Sorry, I'm so sorry

212
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
The kid had a fight last night

213
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
I booked two

214
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
I didn't expect it to be so late

215
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Since you're back to work

216
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
You should adjust

217
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Don't be delayed by personal matters

218
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
I will

219
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
I'll leave after work today

220
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I'll be an assistant

221
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
I won't be back

222
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Go

223
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
I'm back

224
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Sister

225
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,160
I miss you so much

226
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
I miss you so much

227
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
I miss you too

228
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
You're finally back

229
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
How's your kid?

230
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
She's fine

231
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
Who's going to take you home?

232
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
My mom

233
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Your baby is still so good

234
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
No

235
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
No

236
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Well

237
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
Guan

238
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Our new student

239
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
The one next door is his brother

240
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Stop talking

241
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
It's time to start work

242
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Come on

243
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Let's go

244
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
You know

245
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
We have a lot of work

246
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
in our department

247
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Okay

248
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Guan, this is Sister Ai

249
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Sister Ai

250
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Hello, Guan

251
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Let's go

252
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
I'll take you to your new job

253
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Thank you, Sister Zhu

254
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
It's so nice to be back to work

255
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Yeah

256
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
We all miss you so much

257
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
I miss you too

258
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Yeah

259
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Look

260
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
This is your new desk and computer

261
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
It's so nice

262
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Right?

263
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
We've updated a lot of software

264
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,160
WeChat's work account is online

265
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Get used to it

266
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
If you have any questions

267
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
feel free to ask me

268
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Okay

269
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Thank you, Sister Zhu

270
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
You're welcome

271
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Hello, I'm Zou Xinyu

272
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
I'm here to apply for the full course

273
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Do you have a boyfriend?

274
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Yes

275
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
You have a boyfriend

276
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,160
When are you going to get married?

277
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,160
When are you going to have a baby?

278
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Well

279
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Can I...

280
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
You have a baby

281
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Are you going to have a second child?

282
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Director

283
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
I'll take you to the nurse's list

284
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
based on our scores

285
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,160
We're going to recruit two to five people

286
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
If there's a suitable candidate

287
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
we can recruit more

288
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
We have a batch of female doctors

289
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,160
They'll be married in two years

290
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
They're prepared

291
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,160
That's why

292
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,160
I need more men

293
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
But none of them are available

294
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
No matter how good they are

295
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
it's a waste

296
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
I'll go to the medical insurance office

297
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Wait

298
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
I think

299
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,160
we can arrange a meal

300
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
A meal for the stars

301
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
We haven't welcomed

302
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
Guan yet

303
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Director

304
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
the administrative fee for this quarter

305
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
is...

306
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
I'll pay for it

307
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Okay

308
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Yes

309
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
We want Guan to feel

310
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
the warmth of our community hospital

311
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
And the love of Man Bingke

312
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
He just got off work

313
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
so we invited him

314
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,160
and Man Bingke's colleagues

315
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
and we ate together

316
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Where's the appointment?

317
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
You can make the appointment

318
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
I can do it

319
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
I'll hire you

320
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
I'll arrange it

321
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Guan

322
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
These are the five areas you need

323
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
They've been assigned before

324
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Now they're all yours

325
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
This is the list of

326
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
the two people who were diagnosed with cancer

327
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
The hospital has been changed

328
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
They have to be all in place today

329
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
Okay, no problem

330
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
We've just got the public number

331
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
You can manage it

332
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
On September 20th

333
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
there's a press release

334
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
for the day of cancer

335
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
You have to submit it

336
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
after the review

337
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
And the next quarter's

338
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
call-out plan

339
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
will be published after it's done

340
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
I'll check the recent activities

341
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
and I'll inform the school and community

342
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
to give you the next week

343
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Is that okay?

344
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Next Wednesday

345
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
We can't be late

346
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Okay, no problem

347
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Ai

348
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
You have a lot of stuff

349
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
I'll help you

350
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Guan

351
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Have you finished your work?

352
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Yes

353
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Ai just came back

354
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
I'll help him

355
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
You're amazing

356
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
You can help others

357
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
to share their work

358
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
These are the basics

359
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
I've done it

360
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
when I helped others

361
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
Sister Zhu

362
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Arrange some complicated

363
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
work for Guan

364
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Complicated?

365
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
What work?

366
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
People think that

367
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
the work now is too simple

368
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
and too basic

369
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
I know, Zhizhen

370
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Go to see Sister Zhu

371
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Guan, thank you

372
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,160
I can do it myself

373
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Okay

374
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Okay, you can sort it out

375
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Okay

376
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Don't use your phone

377
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Dr. Zeng

378
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
Sister Yuan

379
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
What are you doing?

380
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
I've eaten

381
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Come on, don't be a fool

382
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
You're really a fool

383
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
I bought fruits

384
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
You're drunk

385
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
You're drunk

386
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
Okay, I'll taste it

387
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
I'll taste it

388
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
You're drunk

389
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Uncle Zhang

390
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Xiao Xu

391
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Wait for me

392
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
You're here for me

393
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Come on

394
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Thank you

395
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
I'll find it

396
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Where are you going?

397
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
You can ask me

398
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
I can find it

399
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
Wait for me

400
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Wait for me

401
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Hello

402
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,320
Don't be كان

403
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,320
I went and looked

404
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,200
and saw

405
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,520
A few

406
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
Uncle Zhang

407
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,360
Long

408
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,960
We didn't see each other

409
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
He's your brother

410
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
You two look like each other

411
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
I saw him coming

412
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
I pretended not to know you

413
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
I was afraid

414
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
I know

415
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Xuexu

416
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,160
I really don't want to cause you trouble

417
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
How about your dad's news

418
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Xuexu

419
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
I really can't help it

420
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
So I came to you

421
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
Look at your good health

422
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
You are like those people

423
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
You are so angry

424
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
I came here this time

425
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
I probably know a little bit

426
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
I want to help you

427
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
I really think of a way

428
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Can help you and me

429
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
All go through this difficulty

430
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Yes

431
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
Uncle

432
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
I have no money

433
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,160
I know you have no money

434
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,160
But you have a brother

435
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
I heard you live with your brother

436
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Is that house his?

437
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Houses are valuable

438
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
It's easy to move

439
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Uncle Cheng

440
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
What do you mean?

441
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
I

442
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
I'm not asking your brother to sell the house

443
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Look at your dad

444
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
What does he think of?

445
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I mean your brother

446
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
Can you take your brother's property certificate

447
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
To make a mortgage

448
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
I have an explanation with that bank

449
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Can't

450
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Just make a guarantee

451
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
That's your brother

452
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
At the critical moment, your brother shouldn't help you

453
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Put it in words

454
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Yes, ten thousand steps

455
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
That house is also your dad's

456
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
Your mom left it

457
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Shouldn't you have your share?

458
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Uncle

459
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
My dad

460
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Guan Shan

461
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
He made a mistake

462
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
I can apologize to him

463
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,160
But this matter has nothing to do with Zhao Dong Cheng

464
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
What Zhao?

465
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
You mean your brother?

466
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Okay

467
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
You discuss with him

468
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
I'll wait for you to rest

469
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Uncle

470
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
This matter is not discussed

471
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
I can't spend his money

472
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
You have a point

473
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
You all have a point

474
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
What should I do?

475
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Otherwise, your dad said

476
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Your brother can't find you at all

477
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
And your dad left after taking the money

478
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
I'm not the only one who was cheated

479
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
You're chasing me all over the place

480
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Tell me what I should do

481
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
What should I do?

482
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Yuxuan

483
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
This matter

484
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
We have to talk

485
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
I know

486
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
You and your brother

487
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Which one of them is working?

488
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,160
Don't forget

489
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Your previous job

490
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Was given to the straws by those straws

491
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
I don't want to make things worse

492
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I can't make sense

493
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
But I can't make sense

494
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
I'll give you two days

495
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Call me to give me an answer

496
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
You see for yourself

497
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
I know

498
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
You know

499
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
I know

500
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
I know

501
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Don't forget

502
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Your previous job

503
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
Was given to the straws by those straws

504
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
Xiao Guan, I'm sorry

505
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
We can't continue to use you

506
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
When things get worse

507
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Everyone will look down on us

508
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
I don't think so

509
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,160
This is not my problem

510
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
It's not their problem

511
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
The day to go is coming

512
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
A Gui

513
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,160
Zhao Dongcheng will be your six in the future

514
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
Let's go home

515
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Go home

516
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Go

517
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
Mom

518
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,160
The doctor said

519
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Grandpa needs surgery

520
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
I asked around

521
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
The conservative treatment won't work

522
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
So

523
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
But at his age

524
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
It's risky to have surgery

525
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
What do you think?

526
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,160
You can discuss it with your brother-in-law

527
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
I have something to do here

528
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
I can't come back for a while

529
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Just tell me if you need money

530
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Have you asked other doctors?

531
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Don't listen to what the doctor says

532
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
The age is a big kid's surgery

533
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Can you get the surgery?

534
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
I'm not sure

535
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
How about trying the Chinese medicine?

536
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Yes, Chinese medicine is good

537
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
I heard that eight months of Chinese medicine is very important

538
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
Where do you get it?

539
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Chinese medicine doesn't work

540
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
How can you know this kind of medicine by Chinese medicine?

541
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
The hospital I found for you

542
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
The rank of the surgeon is very high

543
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Yes, or change the hospital

544
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Sister, I heard from my colleague

545
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
Grandpa's disease

546
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Can't eat high protein and high fat

547
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
Have you asked the doctor?

548
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Xiaoxia

549
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Why don't you reply to the message?

550
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
I'm sorry

551
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Come on

552
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Let's have a toast

553
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Welcome Guan Xu

554
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Join our big family

555
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Join our excellent team

556
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Come on, cheers

557
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
Thank you, director

558
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Come on

559
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Come on, sit down

560
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
Come on, Guan

561
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Eat this fish

562
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
This fish is very fresh

563
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,160
Okay, thank you, director

564
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Come on

565
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,160
That dish is good

566
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,160
This one

567
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Look over there

568
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
There is also a big crab

569
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Come on

570
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
I'll give you

571
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Come on, I'll give you

572
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Thank you for taking care of Xiaoxia

573
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
You drink this

574
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Don't kill me

575
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
There is also a crab

576
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,160
It's good to eat crabs this season

577
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,160
Let me take a bite

578
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Come on, Xie Huang

579
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Come on

580
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Give a crab to a few sisters

581
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
I hope you take care of me later

582
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
I'll do it

583
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
Sit down

584
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Let them come

585
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
This is their field

586
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,160
They are best at this

587
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Sit down

588
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
Xiaoxiao, I'm good at it

589
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,160
I usually eat

590
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
And this crab

591
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
It's easy to hurt your hand

592
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
Let me peel it

593
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Thank you, director

594
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Thank you, director

595
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
I should have helped you

596
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Xiaoxiao, you are good

597
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Thank you

598
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
It's a pity that this fish is not here

599
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
He can't eat

600
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
I haven't thought about him tonight

601
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Xiaoxiao

602
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
You said he was here again

603
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
So

604
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
He left early again

605
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
It's normal to get off work

606
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
The law stipulates

607
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
The user unit should have

608
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
A female employee who is not satisfied with the child

609
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Provide at least one hour of daily maintenance time

610
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
I know

611
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Special situation

612
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,160
Why is Qiaoqiao not allowed

613
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
How good

614
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
You must cherish him

615
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Let him have his own space

616
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Xiao Guan

617
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,160
Is the baby of your Manping department

618
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Director, I'm not

619
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
I'm just a newcomer

620
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
modest

621
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,160
You see

622
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
How modest Xiao Guan is

623
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Learn from him

624
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
I can't do it

625
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
We are working

626
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,160
We are working

627
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
We are working

628
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
There is a part of salary

629
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Including this kind of meat

630
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
It's off-duty time

631
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
How can a worker

632
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
Go to work and get off work

633
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
No, I'm not

634
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,160
He is a fool

635
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Get up

636
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
OK, OK, OK

637
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Eat

638
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
Be careful, OK?

639
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
Why are you all

640
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
So careless

641
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
So many delicious things

642
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
Can't get you interested

643
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Come on, eat

644
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
I'll give you a toast

645
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
OK, OK, OK

646
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Thank you for taking care of Xiao Guan

647
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
Director

648
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Did I say something wrong

649
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
No, don't say that

650
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Eat more

651
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Thank you for taking care of Xiao Guan

652
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Everyone

653
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Maybe I was a little inappropriate

654
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
I apologize to everyone

655
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
Apologize, apologize

656
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
Actually what I mean

657
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Not to say

658
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Let everyone not fall in love and not get married

659
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,160
On the contrary

660
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
You all

661
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,160
I caught it

662
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,160
Yu Shi, Gao Yang and Xia Yun

663
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
And you

664
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,160
I caught it

665
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,160
This girl is old

666
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,160
It's really difficult

667
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Learn to be civilized

668
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Shut up

669
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Don't talk

670
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
This is how people like it

671
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Director Chao

672
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
By the way, Yu Shi

673
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
This is about you

674
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
You

675
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Can you not be honest

676
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
A cold face

677
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Smile

678
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Gentle

679
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,160
In fact, sometimes

680
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
You just have to make a deal

681
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Isn't it all over?

682
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
This woman

683
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
There should be a woman

684
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Is it?

685
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Waiter

686
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Waiter

687
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Add dishes

688
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Hello, what would you like to add?

689
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
One meal per person is a lobster

690
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Please wait a moment

691
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
This way please

692
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Okay, thank you

693
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Okay, okay

694
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
Come on, come on

695
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
No one broke the bill

696
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Thank you, Meng Xiang

697
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
I'll treat you to dinner later

698
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,160
Goodbye

699
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
Yu Shi

700
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
Bye bye

701
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Bye bye, director

702
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
What do you say about your own child?

703
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Bear with it

704
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Hello

705
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Guan

706
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
I tell you

707
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
Director, I still want to say

708
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
When we were eating just now

709
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
The dog is still at home

710
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
Aigui is still at home

711
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Right?

712
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Thank you, I'll treat you to dinner later

713
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
Thank you

714
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
I'm leaving

715
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Go

716
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Take care

717
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,160
I didn't answer your question

718
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
You didn't mess with me

719
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
You didn't resign

720
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
You just want to spend time with me

721
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
I haven't asked you yet

722
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,160
Why did you take me away just now?

723
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Why didn't you let me

724
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
finish my words to Zhou Lian Sheng?

725
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
You are a newbie in the workplace

726
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
I'll tell you this

727
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Can you change him?

728
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,160
You can't change

729
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
What's the point of saying that?

730
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
Did you tell him?

731
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
You didn't tell Zhou Lian Sheng

732
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
How do you know he can't change?

733
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
You said I was a newbie in the workplace

734
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
I think you are a dog in the workplace

735
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
How am I a dog in the workplace?

736
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
You just helped him to get rid of it

737
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Did you tell him why?

738
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
So many people

739
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
No one helped Ai Jingjie

740
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
I think you have no

741
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
relationship at all

742
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
OK, OK, OK

743
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
I can't beat you

744
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
I don't want to tell you

745
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
You are too young

746
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
I'm going home

747
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
You stop

748
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
I'm going

749
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Don't wait for you

750
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
I'm like you

751
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
No wonder you said that

752
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
My phone is out of battery

753
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
Give me money

754
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
I'll eat it tomorrow

755
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
I'll give it to you tomorrow

756
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Xiaoxia

757
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Why don't you reply to my messages?

758
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Why don't you reply to my messages?

759
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
People with life

760
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,160
can be treated in the hospital

761
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,160
It's not easy for people around them

762
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
They have to make decisions

763
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,160
and take on the lives of thousands of people

764
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Isn't it easier?

765
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
Xiaoxia

766
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Send it to the office

767
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Send it to the office

768
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
Look

769
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
It's getting cold

770
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
It's almost the end of the year

771
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
The fried crabs are coming down

772
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
If you are at home

773
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,160
I'll steam you a fried crab

774
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
and fry it

775
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I'll make you a bowl of

776
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
your favorite

777
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
A-Gong Ban Mian

778
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,160
Sprinkle with cucumber shreds

779
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
and pickled beans

780
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
It's so good

781
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
By the way

782
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
I want to take you to try

783
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
a new rice noodle shop

784
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
in Guaijiao

785
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,160
The fish soup is so good

786
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
A bowl of rice noodle

787
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
with fish fillings

788
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
and braised red soup

789
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
It's so good

790
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Half a can of rice wine

791
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,160
is even better

792
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
You drink the water first

793
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Okay?

794
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
Yes

795
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,160
I can't eat anything now

796
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
I don't listen to you

797
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
I'll eat whatever you ask me to

798
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
I'll do whatever you ask me to

799
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Okay

800
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Xiaoxia

801
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
You've done a good job

802
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,160
Thank you, A-Gong

803
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
Drink the water first

804
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
I'll heat it up for you

805
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,160
I've decided to do a surgery for Grandpa

806
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
If you have any suggestions

807
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
please ask me in person

808
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Dr. Zhao

809
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
I've decided to do a surgery for Grandpa

810
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,160
I don't know if this decision is right or wrong

811
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
But I won't regret this choice

812
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Do you want to eat bones?

813
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
No

814
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
You're so nice

815
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
You can give me a dog bone

816
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
and I'll be a little dog

817
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
You don't like this?

818
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
If you don't like this

819
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
I'll buy you a new ball

820
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
Do you like it?

821
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Come on

822
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Three, two, one

823
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Hello

824
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Why didn't you answer my call?

825
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,160
Don't you want to answer my call?

826
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
How dare you not answer my call?

827
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
I'm taking a shower

828
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Zhao Dongcheng, you're out

829
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
You didn't tell me about such a big thing

830
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,160
What's the matter?

831
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
Isn't it good?

832
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
Are you in good health?

833
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
If I hadn't talked to my old neighbor

834
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,160
I wouldn't have known

835
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,160
my grandson was back

836
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
Zhao Dongcheng

837
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,160
Are you trying to piss me off?

838
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,160
A-Gui, get the ball back

839
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
A-Gui

840
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
It's not good to come back

841
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,160
You're kind-hearted

842
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
I thought they were dead

843
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
Don't say that

844
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
A-Gui divorced

845
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
She doesn't even want a child

846
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,160
How did I beg her?

847
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
She just wants to live a peaceful life

848
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,160
She only knows to seduce men in the living room

849
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
I've told you so many times

850
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,160
Don't say that

851
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
What divorce? A-Gui?

852
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Can you stop talking about it?

853
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
It was a long time ago

854
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
She thought

855
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
it's good that she's back

856
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
It has nothing to do with the child

857
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,160
I'll take her to see you later

858
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
Okay?

859
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
I'm going to take a shower

860
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
I'm going to take a shower

861
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,160
I'm going to take a shower

862
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
I'm going to take a shower

863
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
I'm going to take a shower

864
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,160
I'm going to take a shower

865
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
I'm going to take a shower

866
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Did I really do that

867
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
to my mom?

868
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
Tang Cai

869
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Impossible

870
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,160
Don't ask

871
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
It's just a question

872
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I just don't believe it

873
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,160
How could I not know what kind of mother I am?

874
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,160
I'm so annoyed.

875
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,160
Forget it.

876
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,160
I'm so annoyed.

877
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Hello, Uncle Zhang.

878
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,160
I'm Guan Xu.

879
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
I have something to tell you.

880
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,160
I can't ask Zhao Dong Cheng to leave.

881
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
If I tell Zhao Dong Cheng,

882
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
he might not blame me.

883
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,160
He might help me.

884
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
But we all know

885
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
it has nothing to do with Zhao Dong Cheng.

886
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
So I can't...

887
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
You mean that thing?

888
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
You're wrong.

889
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,160
You think it has nothing to do with you?

890
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
No.

891
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
What's wrong, Uncle Zhang?

892
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
Why?

893
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
Don't ask.

894
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Uncle Zhang,

895
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,160
did someone tell you something?

896
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,160
Or did you find my father?

897
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,160
If you find my father,

898
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
tell me where he is.

899
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,160
I'm going to find him.

900
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Hello?

901
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
Uncle Zhang?

902
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
Uncle Zhang?

903
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Xu,

904
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,160
leave it.

905
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
I've found your father.

906
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
It has nothing to do with you.

907
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Your father is calling me from this number.

908
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,160
The number you have dialed is power off.

909
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,160
The number you have dialed is power on.

910
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
You're the only one who makes decisions.

911
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
Give me a phone number.

912
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Dr. Guan.

913
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
He asked you to drink yogurt.

914
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
My son remembers you.

915
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
The doctor who saved him in the hospital.

916
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,160
He was afraid that you wouldn't come.

917
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
He asked me to send you here.

918
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Thank you, Dr. Guan.

919
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
Thank you.

920
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Thank you.

921
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Coming.

922
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
You have something to say?

923
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
You just...

924
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
ran.

925
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Backpack.

926
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
It's heavy.

927
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,160
Life is a city.

928
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
It's used for all choices.

929
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,160
Marriage, work, family, love.

930
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,160
It's always people outside the city who want to go in.

931
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
People in the city want to come out.

932
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,160
I've been wanting to find my brother for too long.

933
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
I want to leave him without any reason.

934
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,160
I don't even know how to do it.

935
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,160
And he's been with me for too long.

936
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Maybe he doesn't know how to get close.

937
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,160
Maybe he wants me to leave.

938
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,160
If you really want him to be good,

939
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,160
you can't force him to follow the path you've set.

940
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
People have grown up.

941
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
They have their own path to go.

942
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
Right?

943
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
Right?

944
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,160
You have to understand that.

945
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,160
You can't force him to follow the path you've set.

946
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,160
You have to understand that.

947
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,160
You have to understand that.

948
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
Thank you.

949
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Thank you.

950
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,160
Thank you.

951
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,160
You're welcome.

952
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,160
I'll go to your place.

953
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
I'll go to your place.

954
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
I'm leaving.

955
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
I'll go to your place.

956
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,680
I was thinking of giving you a fake number three months later

957
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,400
and keeping you here.

958
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,920
I'm sorry.

959
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,000
Later, I thought

960
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,160
I shouldn't help you make a choice.

961
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,760
You're not a kid anymore.

962
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,000
You have the ability to choose what you want to choose.

963
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,040
It doesn't matter if you leave now.

964
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,760
I've never asked you

965
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,040
if you want to stay here

966
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,240
or if you like community hospitals.

967
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,920
May I ask

968
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,800
why Guan Shan disappeared all of a sudden?

969
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,080
He owed money

970
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,560
and left.

971
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,680
Then why did you suddenly come here to find him?

972
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,080
I think he might come here

973
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,560
to find out

974
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,520
why he did that.

975
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,560
I understand.

976
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,600
Then think about what I told you.

977
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,200
Write down this number.

978
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,520
I'll return the right to choose to you.

979
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,240
I'm leaving.

980
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,120
Memories.

981
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,460
Episode 29

982
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,120
Welcome

983
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,120
Welcome

984
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Welcome

985
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,120
Welcome

986
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,120
Welcome

987
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,120
Welcome

988
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,120
Welcome

989
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,120
Welcome

990
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,120
Do you think

991
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,120
they are a little strange today?

992
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,120
Yes, a little strange

993
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,120
Good morning, Dr. Shen

994
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,120
Good morning, Dr. Guan

995
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,120
Morning

996
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,120
Morning

997
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,120
Xiao Ji

998
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,120
Morning, director

999
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,120
Morning, director

1000
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,120
Morning, director

1001
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,120
You did well today

1002
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
You went to work so early

1003
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,160
Good good

1004
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Do you have any problems today?

1005
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
No

1006
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,160
You are here to welcome the guests?

1007
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,160
We want to give the warmest greetings to our male colleagues

1008
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,160
Why don't you see you being warm?

1009
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
No

1010
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
All right, stop laughing

1011
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,160
You are a little scared

1012
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,160
Girls are all small, what's wrong with that?

1013
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
It represents the spirit of our hospital

1014
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,200
Keep working

1015
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,200
Yes, director

1016
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
You are not going to type?

1017
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,200
Yes, we are

1018
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
This way, please

1019
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
Stop looking at me

1020
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,200
Stop laughing

1021
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
Stop laughing

1022
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,240
You are so shy

1023
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
That's all for this month's work plan

1024
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
There are two more things

1025
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,240
One is Ai Jing has come back

1026
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,240
She will continue to take on related work

1027
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,240
Including the family doctor

1028
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,240
And the number of signed people last month

1029
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,240
has been also calculated

1030
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,240
It's increasing

1031
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,240
Good good

1032
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,280
Good good

1033
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,280
Guan Xu hasn't joined our family doctor team yet

1034
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,280
He has never served at home

1035
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,280
Ai Jing has come back to work

1036
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,280
She will take more time

1037
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
Let her reflect more

1038
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,280
Director

1039
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,280
All those who need to go to work

1040
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,280
are the old men and women

1041
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,280
who have been in bed for years

1042
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,280
They are also not in a good temper

1043
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,280
The boy

1044
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,280
is not as good as our girl

1045
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,280
He is good-tempered

1046
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
It's better to let our girl do it

1047
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,320
You are right

1048
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,320
You are right

1049
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,320
But I think Guan is quite good-tempered

1050
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
Let her follow the blood pressure

1051
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,320
and test the blood sugar

1052
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,320
and record the data

1053
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,320
Then she can familiarize herself with the residents' files

1054
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
A man is wise

1055
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
This kind of trivial work

1056
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
is not suitable for her

1057
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,320
Then she can

1058
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
I can do physical labor

1059
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,320
Yes yes yes

1060
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,320
Like those old people who are not flexible

1061
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,320
Guan Xu can help them

1062
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,360
No

1063
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,360
Why not?

1064
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,360
How can a hard-working woman

1065
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,360
who has no technical content

1066
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,360
use the baby of our gynecologist?

1067
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,360
You don't let her do this

1068
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,360
and you don't need her

1069
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,360
What else do we need her for?

1070
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,360
Don't worry, director

1071
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,360
Men should be manly

1072
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,360
Do you need anything else?

1073
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,360
I have to hand in my work report this week

1074
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,360
I don't have any extra work

1075
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,360
Then we are dismissed

1076
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,360
Let's go

1077
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,360
Come

1078
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,360
Come

1079
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,360
Director

1080
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,360
I have to go

1081
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,360
What's going on with Xiao Xu?

1082
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,360
How are you two?

1083
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,360
It depends on his choice

1084
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,360
Do you regret it?

1085
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,360
I don't regret it

1086
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,360
I said what I should say

1087
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,360
It's all his choice

1088
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,360
I'm worried about him

1089
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360
No one will take care of him after he goes back

1090
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,360
Forget it

1091
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
I don't want to

1092
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,360
Yes, he will understand

1093
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,360
Yes, people

1094
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,400
People always make decisions

1095
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,400
and regret it

1096
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,400
Do you think

1097
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,400
I should talk to him again?

1098
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
It's all right

1099
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,400
Is your phone so beautiful?

1100
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
You are working in the labor group

1101
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,400
You are happy?

1102
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,440
Yes

1103
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,440
Which one is better?

1104
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,440
This one

1105
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,440
The dress for the art festival

1106
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
This one

1107
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,440
This one?

1108
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,440
Is Su Ye back?

1109
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,440
I told him

1110
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
If he doesn't come back

1111
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,440
I will go with you

1112
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,440
No

1113
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,440
I'm telling you

1114
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,440
I'm watching the science of walking into the world

1115
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,480
It's all nonsense

1116
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,480
Sister Zhu

1117
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
Sister Zhu

1118
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,480
Do you need my help?

1119
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,480
No

1120
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,480
You can have a rest

1121
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,480
What are you doing?

1122
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,480
Give it to me

1123
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,480
I'll do it

1124
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
Take it

1125
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,520
Eat

1126
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,520
OK

1127
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,520
Thank you, sister Zhu

1128
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,520
It's done

1129
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,520
It's fixed

1130
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,520
Go on

1131
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,520
I'm busy

1132
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,520
It's fixed

1133
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,520
It's fixed

1134
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
I don't want to do it

1135
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,520
I can't fix it

1136
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,560
I can't fix it

1137
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,560
Are you a man?

1138
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,560
What does it have to do with being a man?

1139
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,560
Isn't it your man who should fix things?

1140
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,560
Your men are the best at this

1141
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,560
You should fix everything

1142
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,560
Everyone can fix it

1143
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,560
Yes

1144
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,560
Yes

1145
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,560
In fact, not everyone can do housework in life

1146
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,560
Not every man can fix it

1147
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,560
Are you a man?

1148
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,560
Are you a man?

1149
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,560
If you are a man, you should help women fix things

1150
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,560
You fix things

1151
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,560
You fix things

1152
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,560
I fix things

1153
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,560
Hold it

1154
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,600
Hold it

1155
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,600
It's mine

1156
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,600
Fix it

1157
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,600
Put it away

1158
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,600
You can't eat it

1159
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,600
Why are you standing here?

1160
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,600
Are you going to work?

1161
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,600
I'm leaving

1162
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,600
I'm going to work

1163
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,600
Bye

1164
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,600
Tell me

1165
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,600
Have you ever seen Dr. Zhang

1166
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,600
without glasses?

1167
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
No

1168
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,600
He has a white face

1169
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,600
It's like a white face

1170
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,600
He looks like a man

1171
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,600
He is a man

1172
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,600
He is a man

1173
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,600
Is he a little bit

1174
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,600
Dr. Zhang

1175
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,600
I want to get the patient record of Bed 2

1176
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,600
Let me help you

1177
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,600
I can do it myself

1178
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
Let me help you

1179
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,600
What were you talking about?

1180
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,600
Nothing

1181
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,600
Nothing

1182
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,600
Nothing

1183
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,600
I heard you said you were wearing glasses

1184
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,600
The patient record of Bed 2

1185
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,600
Thank you

1186
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,600
It's my pleasure

1187
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,640
Come on

1188
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,640
Stop it

1189
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,640
Come on

1190
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,640
Stop it

1191
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,640
Dr. Zhang

1192
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,640
Please listen to us

1193
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,640
We are talking

1194
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,640
It's so scary

1195
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,640
What's wrong?

1196
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,640
Why don't you rest at noon?

1197
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,640
Sister Jing

1198
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,640
The residents of Wanhang community

1199
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,640
called and said

1200
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,640
they didn't receive

1201
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,640
the notice of changing the place

1202
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,640
of the hospital for the blood test

1203
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,640
They ran to the hospital

1204
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,640
and went to the original place

1205
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,680
The Wanhang community is my fraud

1206
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,680
I'll go and see now

1207
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,680
I apologize

1208
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,680
No need

1209
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,680
Gao Yang has gone to deal with it

1210
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,680
Director Yu, I

1211
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,680
What's the use of going there?

1212
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,680
You can do other jobs

1213
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,680
I'll go to find Director Cheng

1214
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,680
Director Chen won't be rude, will he?

1215
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,680
I have no choice

1216
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,680
It's okay

1217
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,680
You can take a rest

1218
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,680
Sister Ai

1219
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,680
Did you eat or not?

1220
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,680
Not yet

1221
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,680
I'll finish these things first

1222
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,680
This is Wanhang community

1223
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,680
Yes

1224
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,680
We changed the hospital

1225
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,680
of Shancha

1226
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,720
I was informed

1227
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,720
by the doctor

1228
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,720
These things have been informed

1229
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,720
Only Wanhang and Xiahe

1230
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,720
will go

1231
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,720
Then you can go to eat

1232
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,720
Come on

1233
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,720
No, no, Guan

1234
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,720
I don't need it

1235
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,720
I won't go

1236
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,720
I can't eat anyway

1237
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,720
I'll be killed

1238
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,720
if I see them eating

1239
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,720
It's okay

1240
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,720
I'll bring food

1241
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,720
Then you can eat

1242
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,720
You can't be late

1243
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,720
Guan, you look young

1244
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,720
Why are you talking

1245
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,720
like my parents?

1246
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,720
Okay

1247
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,720
Sister, I'll leave you to it

1248
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
I'll go to get things

1249
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,720
Okay, go ahead

1250
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,640
Remember to eat

1251
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,640
Okay

1252
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,640
Mom

1253
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,640
You didn't have a rest

1254
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,640
You can't come back

1255
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,640
on the first day

1256
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,640
No, mom

1257
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,640
I have a lot of work to do

1258
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,640
I know

1259
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,640
I'm sorry

1260
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,640
I'll go to the toilet

1261
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,640
The residents who ran to the wrong place

1262
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,640
have been all settled

1263
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,640
When the incident happened

1264
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,640
we made positive reactions

1265
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,640
and had a sincere attitude

1266
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,640
The residents also understand

1267
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,640
our hard work

1268
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,640
and didn't pursue it

1269
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,640
Director, I thought about it

1270
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,640
Actually, this small mistake

1271
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,640
proved something

1272
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,640
What?

1273
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,640
It proved

1274
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,640
that our regular work

1275
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,640
is relatively successful

1276
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,640
It also shows

1277
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,640
that one's evaluation

1278
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,640
can't be based on a momentary loss

1279
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,600
but on a long-term performance

1280
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,600
Am I right, director?

1281
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,600
I think it's proven

1282
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,600
that you don't usually

1283
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,600
talk

1284
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,600
but don't want to say

1285
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,600
Director, you see

1286
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,600
I know

1287
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,600
But this matter

1288
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,600
should be handled

1289
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,600
in a proper way

1290
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,600
There is a system

1291
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,600
for the hospital to punish

1292
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
No one can be an exception

1293
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,600
But Ai Qing is after all

1294
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,600
She is a personal assistant

1295
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,600
She is a internal inspection

1296
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,600
You are the director

1297
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,600
of this department

1298
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,600
You arrange it yourself

1299
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,560
Dr. Ai

1300
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,560
Xiao Guan

1301
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,560
I'll do some work

1302
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,560
for you this afternoon

1303
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,560
What do you mean?

1304
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,560
It doesn't matter

1305
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,560
I've done it for many people

1306
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,560
Really?

1307
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,560
Thank you

1308
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,560
Dr. Ai

1309
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,560
I know that

1310
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,560
it's hard for you

1311
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,560
to work with your kid

1312
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,560
while you are still a kid

1313
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,560
I also know

1314
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,560
that you are trying to balance

1315
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,560
But sometimes

1316
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,560
you are too strong

1317
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,560
to do anything

1318
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,560
You are not able to do anything

1319
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,560
I know

1320
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,560
But I'm not sure

1321
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,560
if I can help you

1322
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,560
I'm not strong enough

1323
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,560
to do anything

1324
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,560
I'll help you

1325
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,560
It's not embarrassing

1326
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,560
Guan Xu

1327
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,560
Come with me

1328
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,560
Director

1329
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,560
What do you want to say?

1330
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,560
Nothing

1331
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,560
You just stay here

1332
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,560
for five minutes

1333
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,560
Calm down

1334
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,560
I'm touched

1335
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,560
Director

1336
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,560
I'm not touched

1337
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,560
I just want to

1338
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,560
help Dr. Ai

1339
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,560
How do you think

1340
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,560
you can help him?

1341
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,560
I'll help him

1342
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,560
to do some work

1343
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,560
that he can't do

1344
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,560
What else?

1345
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,560
Dr. Ai

1346
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,560
just had a baby

1347
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,560
When he comes back

1348
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,560
there must be some difficulties

1349
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,560
in his physical and psychological

1350
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,560
when he comes back

1351
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,560
You are both women

1352
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,560
You should help him

1353
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,560
and take care of him

1354
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,560
If you leave all your work

1355
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,560
to him

1356
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,560
he will be stressed

1357
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,560
You are very considerate

1358
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,560
Anything else?

1359
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,560
There is

1360
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,560
There was a call

1361
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,560
from his family

1362
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,560
yesterday afternoon

1363
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
I heard that

1364
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,560
he had a family

1365
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,560
with a younger son

1366
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,560
and he had to work

1367
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,560
and take care of his family

1368
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,560
Of course

1369
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,560
It's his mother's nature

1370
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,560
and human nature

1371
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,560
Are you done?

1372
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,560
No matter what others think

1373
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,560
I'll help him

1374
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,560
whether he helps or not

1375
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,560
Then why do you think

1376
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,560
taking care of your family

1377
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,560
is a good thing?

1378
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,560
I'm not sure

1379
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,560
Then why do you think

1380
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,560
taking care of your family

1381
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,560
is a natural thing of a mother

1382
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,560
and a human nature?

1383
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,560
And

1384
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,560
the so-called

1385
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,560
taking care of

1386
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,560
and helping him

1387
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,560
I can also

1388
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,560
explain it in a different way

1389
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,560
to reduce his workload

1390
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,560
and take away his work opportunities

1391
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,560
No

1392
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,560
And as long as it's work

1393
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,560
everyone can make mistakes

1394
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,560
Why do you emphasize

1395
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,560
that he is a mother?

1396
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,560
I just think

1397
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,560
he is too tired

1398
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,560
and too hard

1399
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,560
Yes, for Ai Jing

1400
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,560
the child who just born is very important

1401
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,560
but the job is also important

1402
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,560
When you choose to

1403
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,560
help him and give in to him

1404
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,560
you are actually telling him

1405
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,560
you can't do it

1406
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,560
I didn't think so

1407
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,560
For a novice mother

1408
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,560
it's more important

1409
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,560
to be accepted by the workplace

1410
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,560
than to be understood

1411
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,560
We just don't want Ai Jing

1412
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,560
to think

1413
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,560
everyone is doing the same job

1414
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
in the same office

1415
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,560
Only he is treated differently

1416
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,560
And what you just said

1417
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,560
can easily break the respect

1418
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,560
that everyone works hard to give him

1419
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,560
Director, I don't know

1420
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,560
If you don't know, don't talk nonsense

1421
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,560
or think about it

1422
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,560
before you say it next time

1423
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,560
If you really don't understand

1424
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,560
just open your mouth and ask

1425
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,560
Is that okay?

1426
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,560
Go back to work

1427
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,560
I'm sorry

1428
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,560
I'm sorry

1429
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,560
I'm sorry

1430
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,560
I'm sorry

I'm sorry

1432
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,560
I'm sorry

1433
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,560
I'm sorry
