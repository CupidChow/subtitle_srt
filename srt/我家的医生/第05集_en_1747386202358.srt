7
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Originally, men and women

8
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
are different

9
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now it's changing

10
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We have to deal with it

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's going on?

12
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who offended them?

13
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't look at me

14
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What's wrong with me?

15
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You haven't done anything

16
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yesterday

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
you were so aggressive

18
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and all the words were back

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What did I say?

20
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I said all those things

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
for their own good

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
to care about them

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's so rare

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
for a female leader

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to care about them

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Do you know?

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Leader, you are so good at talking

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This is called caring

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Usually, when you see

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
a male guest

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
they are always

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
very considerate

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
They are very considerate

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I just want to say

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't really

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
care about them

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I always talk like this

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I have been through

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
so much

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why can't I do it now?

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You have to change

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You have to change

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Look at what they eat

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and what you eat

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't even deserve

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
to have a cup of drink

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You are also crazy

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Actually, I think

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
they are good to me

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
They are all each other

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You are good to them

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They are good to you

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They are good to me

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
too

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Sometimes

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
they have different opinions

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But I think

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
it's normal

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We are all together

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and have different opinions

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Right?

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Actually, I think

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
they are good to me

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Although they always joke

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
they are good

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You are good to them

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The temperature in my office

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
is very high and low

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Cheng Yun, you see me

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
you just don't have a good face

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Today

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
you don't even have an eye

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Zheng

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why didn't you say yes?

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Right

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That means

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can have a fight

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
with my female colleagues

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I even gave our five male colleagues

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
a name

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's good

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What's the name?

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Wu Zhishan

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It can make our hospital

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
more stable

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The name is so famous

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What kind of bad name is that?

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's a famous name

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Really

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We are all

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
very stable

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I am so old

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why do I have to suffer this?

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's none of your business

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I have to go to work

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Director, you can eat the bread

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I have to go to work

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm going back

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm going back too

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's a little cold

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm leaving, director

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hello

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hello

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Excuse me

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Do you have a female doctor?

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A female doctor

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What's wrong with you?

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They told me

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you don't charge for women's treatment

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes, but I have a full case

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
How about this?

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll give you a bill

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Take this note and go to the second floor

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Then I'll make an appointment with them

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Then they will call you

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and ask you to do the check-up

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't be nervous

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We do the check-up for free

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Because this is a mixed-race project

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If anyone dares to take your fee

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
you can go to the hall and complain

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you, doctor

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's okay

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You can go to the second floor

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay, thank you

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You're welcome

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hello, Director Xue

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Long time no see

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm Dong Chen

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Well

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I have a patient today

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
who is doing surgery in your tumor

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Can you help me

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
ask him what's going on?

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay, okay, okay

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Thank you, thank you

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Well, then

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
you have news

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Tell me about it

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay?

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay, okay

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay, thank you, Director Xue

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Bye

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Thank you

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Bye

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Bye

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Bye

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Bye

152
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Bye

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Bye

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Bye

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Bye

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Bye

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Sorry, mom

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's okay

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I asked you to help me

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's okay

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's not a few minutes

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Dad

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Your mom who drew yesterday

164
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
won the first prize for you

165
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Really?

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The teacher asked us to vote

168
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and choose the painting we like

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I asked them to choose all my paintings

170
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
They all said they liked me

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
They all said they liked me

172
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I see

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Your mom is dad's painting

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You can't just vote

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Xi Xi

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay, I'll vote

177
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Dad

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We have to pick out clothes when we go back

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's go

180
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hurry up

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay

182
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, Xi Xi's mom

183
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Thank you

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's okay

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Call me if you need help

186
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, okay

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Goodbye

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Bye, Xi Xi

189
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let's go

190
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What's wrong with her?

191
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Doctor Zhang

192
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hello

193
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
She's a man

194
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
She's always having a baby

195
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
She's always having a baby

196
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
She's always having a baby

197
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Xi Xi's mom

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
is not at home every time

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's wrong with her?

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
She's always having a baby with men

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah

203
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yi Yi

204
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why don't you change your shoes?

205
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Change your shoes

206
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Tell me what you want to eat tonight

207
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll cook for you

208
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay

209
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Go wash your hands, Yi Yi

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yi Yi

211
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What's wrong with you?

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What's wrong?

213
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're angry

214
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're not happy

215
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't want to go to the kindergarten tomorrow

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You don't want to go to the kindergarten?

217
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You forgot

218
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
tomorrow is your art festival

219
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You've been looking forward to it for a long time

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We've bought the clothes

221
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't like it

222
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We chose this dress together

223
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's not pretty

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Look, there's a small bag

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's all two-pillared

226
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Is it pretty?

227
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't like it

228
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
How about this?

229
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Let's change it now

230
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and try it, okay?

231
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's not like this

232
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't like it

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Where should I go now?

234
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's too late

235
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Let's wear this tomorrow

236
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay?

237
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
No

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Zhang Yi Yi

239
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If you do this again, I'll be angry

240
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes

241
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't be so hard on me

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You can talk nonsense

243
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
or think about it before you talk next time

244
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If you really don't understand, just open your mouth

245
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and ask

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Is that okay?

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
At that time

248
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Mom

249
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Thank you, Dr. Zhao

250
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I know grandpa will say that today

251
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I thought you drove it

252
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you for helping me

253
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Dr. Zhao

254
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Dr. Zhao

255
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Hello

256
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hello

257
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hello

258
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Car

259
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Dr. Zhao

260
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yi Yi

261
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The meal is ready

262
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The meal I cooked today is very delicious

263
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
If you don't come out

264
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll eat it all by myself

265
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yi Yi

266
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yi Yi

267
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If you don't come out, I'll go in

268
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're finally here

269
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Hurry up

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You should find Zhao Dong Cheng

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I think

272
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You two are easy to communicate

273
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Well

274
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I bought him a dress for the art festival

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He suddenly doesn't like it

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Then I can't buy it anywhere

277
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He didn't come out

278
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Dad

279
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Baby, you're out

280
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Are you hungry?

281
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Dad

282
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What's wrong?

283
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I agree that grandma is weak

284
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
She has a fever

285
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll get you a thermometer

286
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Dad

287
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can't go to the hospital tomorrow

288
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't need a person

289
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Listen to me

290
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Baby, listen to me

291
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't be nervous

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Let's get a thermometer first

293
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yi Yi

294
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You're sick

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let aunt Yu take you to the hospital

296
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Dad

297
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm not dizzy now

298
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I want to go out for a while

299
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll come back for dinner later

300
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't worry

301
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He's still a kid

302
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He doesn't know what it is

303
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
To leave home

304
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He's a old man

305
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Have you finished?

306
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
One person one meal

307
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You

308
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Do you have a bad fever?

309
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What are you doing?

310
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If you can't

311
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
How can you communicate now?

312
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Dad

313
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yi Yi is coming

314
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yi Yi

315
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Where's dad?

316
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Dad

317
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Go in and talk

318
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Do you feel wronged?

319
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't feel wronged

320
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Then the old rule

321
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I ask you to listen

322
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You nod and shake your head

323
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Ok?

324
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Dad bullied Yi Yi

325
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's Yi Yi bullying dad

326
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You don't like the dress I bought you

327
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So dad is angry

328
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I don't like the dress

329
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You don't like the dress

330
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You don't want to attend the art festival

331
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You don't want to attend the art festival

332
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Because mom is not there every time

333
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm so smart

334
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I guessed everything

335
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So you bullied dad

336
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I know dad is a good dad

337
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mom didn't mean to not come

338
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But everyone has parents

339
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't want to just go with dad

340
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Go to the art festival

341
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Is mom's job more important than mine?

342
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Very important

343
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Dad is important too

344
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Mom is important too

345
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Why must you be more important than one?

346
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But I don't want to be more important

347
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't want to be more important than one

348
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But this is me

349
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Five-year-old art festival

350
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Only once in a lifetime

351
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But mom's job tomorrow

352
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Only once in a lifetime

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Brother Ethan promises you

354
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Even if mom doesn't go

355
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Mom's love for you

356
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Won't decrease

357
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Besides, dad goes to the three-house

358
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Dad is with you

359
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You don't love dad anymore

360
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't love dad anymore

361
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I

362
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Mom, why are you saying this?

363
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You want to hurt me

364
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I just want to hurt you

365
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I just want to hurt you

366
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I just want to hurt you

367
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I just want to hurt you

368
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Fortunately, Zhao Dongcheng is here

369
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
My child has a trick

370
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll drink

371
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Am I bad?

372
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You make dad sad

373
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And blame mom

374
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You are not bad

375
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You are not bad

376
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Uncle doesn't like my brother

377
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
He is in my mom's belly

378
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't like him

379
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I just want

380
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Mom's love belongs to me alone

381
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Always with me

382
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So, I'm not bad

383
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I just miss mom too much

384
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Do you miss mom now?

385
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I just hope

386
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
My mother, Mrs. Chen

387
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Can be happier every day

388
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Dad, I'm sorry

389
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's okay

390
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I love you most

391
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
No one is allowed to talk about it outside

392
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
All forget

393
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Okay?

394
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Okay

395
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You are a magic

396
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I forgot who I am

397
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You

398
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And you

399
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
He is fine

400
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The most domineering person today is not in the room

401
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Who is the most domineering?

402
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Who is the most domineering?

403
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm the most domineering

404
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Smart

405
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm the most domineering person today is not in the room

406
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm the most domineering person today is not in the room

407
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm wrong

408
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm the most domineering person today is not in the room

409
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Dr.Fan

410
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What's going on?

411
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Your hands are swollen

412
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Because of this

413
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The time of water drop is long

414
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
His hands will be swollen

415
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
If you are worried

416
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You can use a hot towel

417
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
To apply it

418
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It will ease the pain

419
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay

420
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'll go to the bathroom

421
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Okay

422
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay

423
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Okay

424
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Okay

425
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Okay

426
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Okay

427
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Okay

428
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Okay

429
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay

430
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Okay

431
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Okay

432
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Okay

433
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The other side

434
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Okay

435
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay

436
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay

437
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Okay

438
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Okay

439
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Okay

440
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Okay

441
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I know

442
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I asked full protection

443
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,120
He has telos

444
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,920
But the 어sia disability

445
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He is on an incurable condition

446
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,800
I'm fine

447
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,480
Xiaotan

448
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,800
Go and check

449
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,760
how's the second bed

450
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,640
Don't worry

451
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,200
You should be patient

452
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,320
and give the patient some confidence

453
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,960
Okay

454
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,800
Thank you

455
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,640
Come on

456
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,960
I'm fine

457
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,400
Aunt

458
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,480
How do you feel?

459
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,520
I feel better

460
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,600
Thank you, doctor

461
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,280
Your nail polish is so beautiful

462
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,320
It's beautiful

463
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,040
Come on

464
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,000
Come on

465
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,520
Xiaotan

466
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,240
Yicheng's family

467
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,680
has been here with him all the time

468
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,120
We're always here

469
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,080
with his husband

470
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,760
I just want to

471
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,920
send him some food when he's hungry

472
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,160
You should pay more attention to him

473
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,880
If he goes out to get hot water

474
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,560
or to use the bathroom

475
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,080
you should come and help him

476
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,360
Don't make trouble

477
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,120
I see

478
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,080
Doctor Zhang

479
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,320
Let's go

480
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,760
That's enough

481
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,760
Director Cheng

482
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,360
Do you have any questions?

483
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,400
I have some personal questions

484
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,760
I hope you don't mind

485
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,440
No problem

486
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,080
Just ask me

487
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,680
You have a girlfriend

488
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,240
When are you going to get married?

489
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,680
Will you ask for a child

490
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,200
right away?

491
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,240
Well

492
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,680
It's okay if you don't want to say it

493
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,200
Just pretend I didn't ask

494
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,800
Wu

495
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,040
Director

496
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,560
Our Jiceng Hospital

497
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,280
is more suitable for men and women

498
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,560
Women

499
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,880
have a large part of the population

500
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,200
If you're lucky

501
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,400
to join our hospital

502
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,120
I hope you

503
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,440
respect them

504
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,480
and help them

505
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
More importantly

506
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,280
you should treat them equally

507
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,800
In our hospital

508
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,320
we won't give you a bonus

509
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,160
because of your gender

510
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
In our hospital

511
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,720
there are no male doctors

512
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,600
female doctors

513
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,280
male nurses

514
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,440
female nurses

515
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,520
They're all doctors

516
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,440
and nurses

517
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,640
Do you understand?

518
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,120
Yes

519
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,720
Yes

520
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,320
Okay

521
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,280
That's all for today

522
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,200
Wait for the notice

523
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,560
Okay

524
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,320
Okay

525
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,640
I hope you can join our hospital

526
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,480
Okay

527
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,720
No need to see me off

528
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,760
No need to see me off

529
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,520
Director Cheng

530
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,040
What do you think of this boy?

531
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,040
What do you think?

532
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,880
Of course I think

533
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,280
he's not good

534
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,200
I think

535
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,560
the girl from last time is better

536
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,560
Director

537
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
you should understand

538
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,720
it's not that we don't recruit men

539
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,760
but because we can't keep them

540
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,440
Women

541
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,200
are responsible

542
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,560
and have a good sense of time

543
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
in terms of their work

544
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,240
I understand

545
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,840
What do you think of my performance?

546
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,720
Isn't it enough?

547
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,000
What's wrong with you today?

548
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,680
You seem to have changed

549
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,480
How did I change?

550
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,120
I always think

551
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,160
girls are good

552
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,920
I've always been

553
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,480
satisfied with these girls

554
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,920
Stop talking nonsense

555
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,760
Tell me

556
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,480
What do you want to say?

557
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,920
Well

558
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,120
When I went to eat noodles today

559
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,600
I heard someone say

560
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,160
Sister Chun is too fancy

561
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,120
and doesn't match her age

562
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,080
I heard it

563
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,760
and stopped immediately

564
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,520
I said I hate you

565
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,760
You can't even control yourself

566
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,680
and you're still controlling others

567
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,320
Do you know what it is?

568
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,000
It's called difference

569
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,120
It's called age discrimination

570
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,240
Do you understand?

571
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,000
Who said that when a woman is old

572
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,400
she can't wear beautiful clothes?

573
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,200
Right?

574
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,640
You're still so clumsy

575
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,000
and you're still so clumsy

576
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,240
Well

577
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,800
I'm not bad, right?

578
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,040
Then you should make up for it

579
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,880
I understand

580
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,840
The number you have dialed is unavailable

581
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,320
The number you have dialed is unavailable

582
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,960
I forgot to save the file

583
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,280
before I turned off the computer

584
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,400
I should rewrite my reading report

585
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,560
Look at my head

586
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,400
I just called the public relations office

587
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,680
I even forgot to save the gift quantity

588
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,880
How can I be a public relations office?

589
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,120
Look

590
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,520
I forgot to put my son's love book

591
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,760
in my bag again

592
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,760
I'm old

593
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,000
and I'm not smart

594
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The BMI's weight calculation formula

595
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,720
and the standard value of the blood sugar after meals

596
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,920
How many people do you know?

597
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,560
I forgot

598
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,480
How can I forget all of this?

599
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,040
I forgot

600
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,080
Who should I scold first?

601
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,520
What are you doing?

602
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,800
You're so bad at acting

603
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,720
I don't know if women who are not into the game

604
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,160
are really easy to get excited

605
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,800
We're all acting like this

606
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,200
but you're still excited

607
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,680
Director, what should we do?

608
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,600
I reported to the head nurse

609
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,120
that you miscalculated the blood sugar

610
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,160
Stop acting

611
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,600
We're done here

612
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,200
I didn't act. It's true

613
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,200
No, Chen Mei Lan

614
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,240
When you were making up your mind

615
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,720
last night, you were so fast

616
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,280
Why are you so careless

617
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,480
every time you do this?

618
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,080
Because of Dr. Zhao's old ads

619
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,200
I only know how to do this and that

620
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
to Director Zhou

621
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,400
Stop finding excuses

622
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,680
I'll go

623
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,520
I'll go to the head nurse

624
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
I'm sure it can be solved

625
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,240
Okay

626
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,040
If there's no problem

627
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,160
I'll go to arrange it

628
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,760
Okay

629
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,000
Head nurse

630
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Ai Jing is back

631
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,000
Pay attention to your people in the room

632
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,960
I know

633
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,280
I'll let her do some

634
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,080
easy work first

635
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,360
I didn't mean that

636
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,560
I want you to help her

637
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,960
to return to the workplace as soon as possible

638
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,240
and integrate her into you

639
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,560
I think

640
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
this is what she really needs

641
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,640
What are you looking at?

642
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,240
Go to work

643
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
I'm going to work

644
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm going to work

645
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,520
I'm going to work

646
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,320
Stop acting

647
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,360
Miss Jin

648
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,640
Chen said the number of people who reported

649
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,720
the drafts you reported was wrong

650
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,400
Is it in the system now?

651
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,920
Yes

652
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,920
When I entered

653
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,040
I even compared it with

654
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
the small quantity

655
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,920
Can I confirm it again?

656
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,440
Come on

657
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,520
You come and have a look

658
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,200
I'll take a look here

659
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
It seems that

660
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,840
Wanhang Community has missed one page

661
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,880
Yes

662
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,320
Let me change it

663
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,120
Dr. Wang, please

664
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,680
enter the diagnosis table

665
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,080
Okay

666
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,160
There's no problem this time

667
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,560
Okay

668
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,880
Thank you, head nurse

669
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,520
Thank you

670
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,600
Director Cheng

671
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,040
Ai Jing

672
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,320
By the way

673
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,280
How is the thing

674
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,360
done with the draft?

675
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,640
That time it was my mistake

676
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,000
I will never make

677
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
such a mistake again

678
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,960
Everyone makes mistakes

679
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,800
Pay attention next time

680
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,000
Director Cheng

681
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,800
Director Yu told me

682
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,040
Actually, I was quite worried

683
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,280
before I came back

684
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,200
I heard from my friend

685
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,960
that I had to take a leave

686
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,440
and come back to work

687
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,360
I always feel

688
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,280
quite sad

689
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,200
I feel

690
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,880
I feel like being a mother

691
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,440
is different from others

692
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,160
I feel my identity is reduced

693
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,440
So I tried my best

694
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,360
I don't want to drag everyone down

695
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,640
But I didn't expect

696
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,240
Ai Jing

697
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,200
I just said

698
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,400
everyone makes mistakes

699
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,360
Whether you make mistakes

700
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,880
or have a divorce

701
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
is none of your business

702
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,840
It's your personal problem

703
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,680
As for this thing

704
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,040
Director Yu will handle it

705
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,200
I don't want to listen to

706
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,360
any explanation from you

707
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,120
The one who made a mistake

708
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,960
should be punished

709
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,920
It's the same

710
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,360
Thank you, Director Cheng

711
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,520
I'm punished, Hai Xin

712
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,560
Thank you for what you said to Director Yu

713
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,280
Respect is more important than understanding

714
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,000
You are really a good girl

715
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,520
What's not difficult in life?

716
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,920
It will get better and better

717
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,800
At least now

718
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,200
someone is willing to ask you for your opinion

719
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,720
and to face the problem

720
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,640
Not only is it simple

721
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,440
but also a kind of emotional change

722
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,160
It's getting better and better

723
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,960
Isn't it?

724
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,600
Work hard

725
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,840
Hello, Dr. Wang

726
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Do you need any help?

727
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,640
Excuse me

728
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,680
How can I get to the earlobe department?

729
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,720
This way

730
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,400
Thank you

731
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,960
This is the earlobe department

732
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,760
Dr. Zhang

733
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,120
Please take care of her

734
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,680
You can take a rest here

735
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
The doctor will be here soon

736
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,000
Okay, thank you

737
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,720
You're welcome

738
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,720
Thank you

739
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,840
It's okay, don't mention it

740
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,160
You can take a rest here first

741
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,360
Okay, thank you

742
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,880
I'm not crying

743
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,560
Honey, honey

744
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,600
Look at her

745
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,640
She's crying

746
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,640
What's wrong with you?

747
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,320
Look at her diaper

748
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,080
It's all dirty

749
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,000
How can she cry?

750
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,800
Change another one

751
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,800
I don't have it either

752
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,560
Didn't I ask you to take it?

753
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,000
Stop it

754
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,280
I'll go back and get it now

755
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,920
What else?

756
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,400
Calm down

757
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,040
I'll take care of the diaper

758
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,800
Use mine first

759
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:57,920
Here you are

760
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,600
Thank you

761
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,240
It's okay

762
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,720
I'll change it for her

763
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,080
Don't change it directly

764
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,040
There's tissue here

765
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,440
Change it after you give it to the baby

766
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,440
Thank you

767
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Tell me

768
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,440
What can a man do now?

769
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,200
Don't be angry

770
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,320
I have no choice

771
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,120
I didn't plan to rely on him

772
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,320
Let's go for dinner

773
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,240
Let me take a breath first

774
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,160
She ran away

775
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,360
Have some water first

776
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,920
I can't

777
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,200
What's wrong?

778
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,800
She's a partner of Dr. Zhang

779
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,920
She's good at everything

780
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,960
But she's so easy to talk to

781
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,560
She will do whatever the patient asks

782
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,120
She's not even a doctor

783
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,080
Dr. Zhang is indeed a little strange

784
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,760
Speaking of which

785
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,680
I've never seen her wife

786
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,800
She's been in our hospital for years

787
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,520
I've never seen her wife

788
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,520
There must be something wrong

789
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,600
Dr. Zhang

790
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,160
will not be divorced, right?

791
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,600
Isn't it possible?

792
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,160
Why don't you two go for dinner?

793
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,440
I'll go right away

794
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
I'll go right away

795
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,480
It's okay

796
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,600
I'll have dinner soon

797
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,560
I'll handle it when I go to work

798
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,320
Okay, I'll come back

799
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,600
Hello

800
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,640
Where are you, darling?

801
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,400
In the hospital

802
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,600
When will you get off work?

803
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,640
Let's pick up the baby together

804
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,920
Pick up the baby?

805
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,880
How many times have you picked up the baby?

806
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,040
I've been waiting for you

807
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
I'm coming

808
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,400
Who wants to pick up the baby with you?

809
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,000
Okay, okay, okay

810
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,720
I'll pick it up

811
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,600
I'll give you a delivery

812
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,040
Hello

813
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,400
Delivery

814
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,040
Miss Chen Yu is here

815
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,400
Director Chen, I'm looking for you

816
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,880
Miss Chen Yu, right?

817
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,040
Your delivery

818
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,440
Thank you

819
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,200
You're welcome

820
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,000
What are you doing?

821
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,120
This is not a delivery

822
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,640
This is my favorite lunch

823
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,760
You made it?

824
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,200
Don't buy it from me

825
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,640
You know I don't want this

826
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,720
I've been doing this all afternoon

827
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,760
I'm sorry

828
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,920
You called me to apologize

829
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,600
because you couldn't get the baby

830
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,520
I'm sorry

831
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,920
I know you've had a hard time

832
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
Enough

833
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,040
Don't say sorry all the time

834
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,240
I'm not the only one

835
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,080
You should make more efforts

836
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,640
This time

837
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,880
no matter how much I worry about you

838
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
I won't go back

839
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,600
I just want you to know

840
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,280
it's not easy to take care of a baby

841
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,200
I'm sorry

842
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,080
I know I was wrong

843
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,840
And

844
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
I'm telling you

845
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,800
I'll work all the time

846
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,440
until I retire

847
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,360
Don't tell me

848
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,760
that I'll resign

849
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,720
If you dare to say it again

850
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,960
I'll fire you first

851
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,200
I really know I was wrong this time

852
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,400
Go home

853
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,880
I miss you so much

854
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,920
Your performance day

855
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,040
is coming soon, right?

856
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Go home tonight

857
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,000
I'll be there

858
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,080
Take care of yourself

859
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,520
Eat as much as you can

860
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I know how to eat

861
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,840
I know

862
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Hang up

863
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Dr. Shen

864
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,240
I'll treat you to milk tea

865
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,400
It's all sugar

866
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,840
Ms. Qiu

867
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,920
I don't need milk tea anymore

868
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,440
Don't worry

869
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,800
I won't tell anyone

870
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,400
It's not a big deal

871
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,880
It's okay to tell anyone

872
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,040
I had a fight with my husband

873
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,840
So I stayed a little bit longer in the hospital

874
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,320
I thought I had nothing to do

875
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,560
But I was told that

876
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,160
But now

877
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,480
my husband has helped me

878
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,640
I can go home and practice

879
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,360
Ms. Cheng

880
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,560
Don't tell me

881
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
your secret

882
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,760
I don't want to hear it

883
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,600
Okay

884
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,840
You can go back to your room

885
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,400
Okay

886
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,280
Ms. Cheng

887
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,920
When you can perform on stage

888
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,880
can you invite me to see it?

889
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,240
I'll buy the tickets myself

890
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,280
Sure

891
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,240
Good luck

892
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,640
Good luck

893
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,440
Dr. Shen

894
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,120
Morning

895
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,800
Morning

896
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,240
Whose milk tea is this?

897
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,880
This

898
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,320
I bought it for

899
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,240
For you

900
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,320
For me?

901
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,000
It's sugar

902
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,400
I love sugar

903
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,280
Thank you

904
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,520
We Olga

905
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,760
Tong Tong, sit down first

906
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,480
Here

907
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,520
So you

908
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,480
We300

909
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,200
Chengtong

910
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,160
The best

911
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,160
We go in

912
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,000
Let's go

913
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,600
Okay

914
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,440
I'm sorry.

915
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,200
Xixi.

916
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,640
Grandpa, dad is here.

917
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,480
This is my husband.

918
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,360
Hello.

919
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,200
Hello.

920
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,320
Call me uncle.

921
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,720
Hello, uncle.

922
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,800
Hello, Xixi.

923
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,160
Grandpa, where's your mom?

924
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,880
Dad.

925
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,440
My phone.

926
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,040
Grandpa.

927
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
Grandpa.

928
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,760
Grandpa.

929
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,720
Grandpa.

930
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,720
Grandpa.

931
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,640
Grandpa.

932
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,440
Grandpa.

933
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,400
Mom is busy now.

934
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,760
It's not convenient to answer the phone.

935
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,640
Hello.

936
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Hello, mom.

937
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,240
Someone asked you today.

938
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,840
Why didn't you come?

939
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,360
Grandpa, you're so good.

940
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,960
Is your mom busy?

941
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,040
Yes.

942
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,560
You should learn from your dad.

943
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,920
Be more considerate.

944
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,040
No.

945
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,720
I'm not here.

946
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,440
I'll go to see him.

947
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,200
But it doesn't matter.

948
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,800
Art Festival is not the only one.

949
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,440
There will be

950
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,160
six-year-old art festival,

951
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,680
seven-year-old art festival,

952
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,000
and master's and doctoral art festival.

953
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
Because

954
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,680
my parents are the best parents in the world.

955
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,840
Yi will be more and more beautiful

956
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,200
and smarter.

957
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,280
Yi, you're so good.

958
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,280
Mom, dad is so handsome today.

959
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,400
It's a pity you can't see him.

960
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,600
It's a pity.

961
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,160
How about this?

962
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,320
Mom asked dad to record both Yi and himself.

963
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,080
Mom doesn't want to miss Yi's performance.

964
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,000
Okay.

965
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,840
You must watch carefully.

966
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Because my performance is very wonderful.

967
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,000
But

968
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,600
you can't be late for work, okay?

969
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,520
Okay.

970
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,440
Yi, I wish you a successful performance.

971
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,920
Yi, I wish you success, too.

972
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,160
Come on.

973
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,720
Dad.

974
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,920
Dad.

975
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,720
I'll be a mom in the future.

976
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,440
I'll marry a hard-working man

977
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,440
like dad.

978
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,960
Baby.

979
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,920
You can do whatever you want in the future.

980
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,360
I just hope you can

981
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,040
be healthy and happy, okay?

982
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,200
Yi is also my mom.

983
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,480
No.

984
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,600
Yes.

985
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,840
Mr. Zhang Jun,

986
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,120
Ms. Su Ye,

987
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,640
thank you for being healthy and happy.

988
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,600
Go to play.

989
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,240
Okay.

990
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,200
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

991
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,240
Thank you.

992
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,880
Come on.

993
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,840
Have an apple.

994
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,320
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

995
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,760
Dr. Wang, have an apple.

996
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,080
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

997
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,240
Come on.

998
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:53,960
Have an apple.

999
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,720
Have an apple.

1000
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,400
Thank you.

1001
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,320
Dong Cheng.

1002
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,560
What are you doing?

1003
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,600
Take a break.

1004
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,040
Have an apple.

1005
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,000
Director Chen said

1006
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,440
you should treat us to a meal,

1007
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,200
not just fruits.

1008
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,360
I don't want to eat.

1009
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,200
You are so stingy.

1010
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,160
I'll go in later.

1011
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,400
Guan.

1012
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:16,800
Director.

1013
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,200
Come on.

1014
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,000
Have an apple.

1015
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,600
Thank you, director.

1016
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,640
Dong.

1017
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,800
You gave the bamboo fish to Director Yu.

1018
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,280
Director Yu,

1019
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,520
the gynecology department

1020
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,720
and other female doctors in the hospital

1021
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,320
are all against us, but not against you.

1022
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,960
It's because you gave Director Yu an idea.

1023
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,360
One more for you.

1024
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,040
Zhang Yi Yi didn't say anything.

1025
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,200
You can read his mind.

1026
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,400
How complicated can a child be?

1027
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,040
When you were a kid,

1028
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,680
why didn't you understand your mother?

1029
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,040
Why did you drive her away?

1030
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,520
You called your grandmother that day.

1031
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,720
I heard it.

1032
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,640
And what you didn't want me to know,

1033
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,720
what you didn't want me to hear,

1034
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,960
I heard it too.

1035
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,920
I heard it.

1036
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,800
Mom and dad quarreled.

1037
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,680
You quarreled with mom.

1038
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,880
But later, I thought about it.

1039
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,640
If we can make everyone happy,

1040
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,880
it's not a bad thing.

1041
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,920
I want to ask you.

1042
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,840
Was it really because mom did something wrong

1043
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,320
that you drove her away?

1044
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,360
Brother.

1045
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,400
Wait, Xiao Xu.

1046
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,480
Brother.

1047
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,480
Hurry up.

1048
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,480
It's hot.

1049
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,560
What's wrong with you?

1050
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,600
What's wrong with you?

1051
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,200
Can you wear it?

1052
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,480
It's too big.

1053
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,240
Really?

1054
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,960
Brother, what are you looking at?

1055
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,160
Brother.

1056
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,480
Nothing.

1057
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,720
Don't look over there.

1058
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,560
Look.

1059
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,480
The ice in your hand is melting.

1060
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,920
Brother.

1061
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,760
Go.

1062
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,160
I'll buy you another one.

1063
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,320
No.

1064
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,760
Shut up.

1065
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,000
No.

1066
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,600
Zhao.

1067
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,640
I...

1068
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,440
Shameless.

1069
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,200
You wear the same clothes all day

1070
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,880
and talk to that new official.

1071
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,960
Don't think I don't know.

1072
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,240
Do you know what people around me think of me?

1073
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,880
Do you know what they say of me?

1074
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,680
I can't afford to lose this person.

1075
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,600
Dong Cheng, what are you doing?

1076
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,400
Dong Cheng.

1077
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,840
I hate you.

1078
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,680
I don't want to see you in this house.

1079
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,160
Dong Cheng, I really have nothing to do with him.

1080
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,000
We're just dancing.

1081
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
He's just my dance partner.

1082
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,800
I just like to dance. Dong Cheng.

1083
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,840
Dong Cheng, I beg you.

1084
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,360
I beg you too.

1085
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Leave your father. Leave this house.

1086
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,320
I'm begging you.

1087
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,640
I'm begging you.

1088
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,920
I'm begging you.

1089
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,160
I'm begging you.

1090
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,360
I'm begging you.

1091
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,560
I'm begging you.

1092
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,800
Leave this house.

1093
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,720
Dong Cheng.

1094
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,800
I don't want to hear you

1095
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,320
quarrel with your father all day.

1096
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,160
I don't want to see you in this house.

1097
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,240
No.

1098
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,640
Don't look.

1099
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,920
Your mother was cheated by your father.

1100
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,400
She must be so sad.

1101
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,280
She didn't even take care of her until death.

1102
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,480
She can't even lift her head in front of people.

1103
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,280
What mother is sad about

1104
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,000
is not being cheated by her father.

1105
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,040
It's not being treated as a woman

1106
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,080
who doesn't deserve to be treated.

1107
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,160
It's her mother

1108
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,120
who didn't try to understand her.

1109
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,200
How can I not understand her?

1110
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,440
Who took care of her when she was hurt?

1111
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,560
Grandma.

1112
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:07,920
The wound on her hand

1113
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,040
wasn't left when she was cooking.

1114
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,520
It was left after you left that day.

1115
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,480
But we all

1116
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,840
went through this.

1117
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,040
That's why.

1118
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,320
She doesn't want to be ignored,

1119
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,400
not respected,

1120
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,800
not understood like you.

1121
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,320
She doesn't even have herself.

1122
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,840
She told me

1123
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,360
that her mother was a poor woman.

1124
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,840
What are you doing?

1125
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,440
Have you finished your meal?

1126
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,160
You're still on the phone in the room.

1127
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,720
Your son and grandson will be back soon.

1128
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,200
What are you doing?

1129
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,320
So you knew

1130
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,600
everything at that time?

1131
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,440
You were still young at that time.

1132
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,200
In the past, everything was the same

1133
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,480
regarding shift.

1134
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,320
Either the mind notime

1135
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,800
or the condition of the mind.

1136
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,720
That didn't exist at that time.

1137
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,240
As long as God's blessing

1138
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,720
has been given,

1139
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,520
something is'll done with those family were born.

1140
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,640
In the past, I couldn't remember anything.

1141
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,200
I didn't get along with you

1142
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,280
either day and night.

1143
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,280
There were two cheaters and l машs every day.

1144
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,600
In fact, it's not like that.

1145
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,960
I was also angry at that time.

1146
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,160
I didn't understand many things.

1147
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,400
I didn't understand what the director was thinking.

1148
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,680
But I couldn't hear

1149
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,200
that I didn't divorce for the sake of the child.

1150
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,160
I hope that when he leaves,

1151
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,400
he can be less burdened.

1152
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,920
I hope I can find the life he wants.

1153
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,920
Your mom won't take you as a burden.

1154
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,480
I hope that when he leaves,

1155
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,320
he can be less burdened.

1156
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,440
I miss him.

1157
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,320
Until now, I know

1158
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,920
that Zhao Dong Cheng didn't change his mom's life.

1159
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,920
He gave her freedom.

1160
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,360
But we were still young at that time.

1161
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,040
We didn't know how to choose a better way.

1162
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,960
Many experiences in life

1163
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,200
can't be taken in.

1164
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,280
Besides being a mom,

1165
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,000
there are also things that you want to pursue.

1166
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,200
Dad, don't cry.

1167
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,000
I won't cry.

1168
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,120
I'm happy.

1169
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,680
Family and work are balanced.

1170
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,360
It has nothing to do with gender.

1171
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,600
There are fathers who love to cook in this world.

1172
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,560
There are mothers who can make money.

1173
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,520
What's wrong with girls who like to climb trees?

1174
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,000
What's wrong with boys who like to cry?

1175
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,720
What we can do is to let go of

1176
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,480
our prejudice against gender.

1177
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,160
Accept them.

1178
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,280
No need to be surprised.

1179
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,040
No need to change.

1180
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,480
Because everything is very ordinary.

1181
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,480
I'm always happy.

1182
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:45,480
So, just forget it all.

1183
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,400
There we go.

1184
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,400
Let me see

1185
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,400
Dad YingYu

1186
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
I will give you another chance

1187
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,400
Thank you, Mr. Wang

1188
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,400
Dad, I am so happy today

1189
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,400
YuXin

1190
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,400
Bye

1191
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,400
Bye

1192
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,400
Thank you

1193
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,400
Dad YingYu

1194
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,400
This Friday, the parent's class

1195
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
It's your turn. This is an invitation notice

1196
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
Parents' class

1197
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,400
Yes, there are detailed contents

1198
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,400
You can have a look

1199
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
I will go in first

1200
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,400
Dad

1201
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,400
ShenXinXin

1202
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,400
Get up

1203
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
ShenXinXin, get up

1204
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,400
Get up

1205
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,400
Get up

1206
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,400
I will take the money

1207
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,400
I told you to get out

1208
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
Get up

1209
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
Mom, I don't need to get up

1210
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
I don't need to get up

1211
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,400
You are dead, I am happy

1212
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,400
Get up, you bad boy

1213
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
Bad boy, get up

1214
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
Mom, I beg you

1215
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,400
Get up

1216
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,400
Get up

1217
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
Get up

1218
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,400
Get up

1219
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,400
Chen, chicken

1220
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,400
Chicken and egg

1221
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,400
Two

1222
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,400
I am going to eat

1223
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,400
I am not hungry

1224
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
I can't eat

1225
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
I told you you can't eat

1226
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
I will go to the next month's training

1227
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,400
I will go too

1228
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,400
So

1229
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,400
AiJie is back

1230
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
I will help

1231
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,400
And keep an eye on Zhou Lian Sheng

1232
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
Don't let her bully women again

1233
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,400
What's wrong?

1234
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,400
It's none of your business

1235
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,400
Don't be self-conceited

1236
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
Sister, are you ready?

1237
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,400
Come on, tea powder

1238
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,400
It's rare

1239
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
Two brothers have tea powder together

1240
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
You should come to eat with me

1241
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,400
Okay, I will give you a drink

1242
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,400
Liu Qi, I don't eat your food

1243
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
You eat

1244
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,400
Aunt

1245
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Liu Qi, you are a doctor

1246
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,400
Why do you have to pay for it?

1247
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,400
So what?

1248
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,400
You have a lot of new clothes

1249
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400
Do you want to take some home?

1250
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,400
Okay

1251
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,400
Let me see if there is something suitable for your parents

1252
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,400
It's suitable for my mother

1253
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,400
It must be the most expensive

1254
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
The most expensive

1255
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,400
That

1256
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,400
OK

1257
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,400
OK, I'll give it to you

1258
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,400
Aunt Mei

1259
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,400
How much is this dress?

1260
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,400
It's not that expensive

1261
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,400
You can give it to me

1262
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,400
It's a good deal

1263
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,400
It's not cheap

1264
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,400
It's okay, just give it to me

1265
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
OK

1266
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,400
I'll pay for it

1267
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,400
OK

1268
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,400
Good job

1269
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,400
Of course

1270
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
Now wechat can be directly charged

1271
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,400
Why are you still in charge?

1272
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,400
If I don't go to work in person

1273
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,400
How can I be in charge?

1274
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,400
Thank you

1275
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,400
Heart and brain blood vessels

1276
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
Disease measures

1277
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,400
You put me here

1278
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Disease measures

1279
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,400
Disease measures

1280
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,400
Disease measures

1281
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,400
Disease measures

1282
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
Dr. Zhang

1283
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,400
Dr. Zhang, it's Yichuang again

1284
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,400
The situation is really bad

1285
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,400
Go and see what happened

1286
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,400
Yichuang

1287
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,400
Yichuang, can you hear me?

1288
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,400
Yichuang

1289
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
Don't turn me

1290
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,400
I'm a loser

1291
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,400
Don't say that

1292
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,400
How can you say that you are wrong?

1293
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
Listen to me

1294
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,400
I'll give you a shot

1295
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,400
You'll feel better after a nap

1296
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,400
Think about your family

1297
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
Don't worry about me

1298
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Let me die

1299
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
Let me die

1300
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
There is a doctor

1301
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,400
Don't be afraid

1302
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,400
Look at this photo

1303
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,400
It's so good

1304
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,400
And put on

1305
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,400
Your favorite sweater

1306
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,400
That was last year

1307
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,400
Our wedding anniversary

1308
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,400
I gave it to you

1309
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
At that time

1310
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,400
I saw this sweater in the store

1311
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,400
It reminds us

1312
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,400
When we were young

1313
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,400
You in red sweater

1314
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,400
Run to me

1315
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,400
I'm so happy

1316
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
You run to me

1317
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,400
Qiwen

1318
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,400
No matter what you look like

1319
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,400
It will be my favorite

1320
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,400
Look

1321
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,400
You remember this

1322
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
It's okay

1323
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,400
I'm waiting

1324
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,400
You go out early

1325
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,400
Put on this sweater

1326
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,400
Take a picture

1327
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,400
Mom, you're back

1328
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,400
Mom

1329
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
I'm afraid you'll mess up

1330
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,400
Don't do it yet

1331
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
Here, a gift

1332
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
You'll like it

1333
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,400
How about it?

1334
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
I'll do it

1335
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,400
What's this?

1336
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,400
I tell you, mom

1337
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,400
Don't look down on yourself

1338
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,400
In my heart, you're definitely

1339
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,400
Good for this sweater

1340
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,400
I tell you, you wear anything my dad likes

1341
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
I don't mean to say

1342
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
You never wear this sweater

1343
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,400
I tell you

1344
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,400
The less cloth, the better

1345
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
You bastard, you don't trust me, do you?

1346
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,400
No, mom

1347
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
I don't want you to do this

1348
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,400
Mom, don't go

1349
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,400
I told you not to go

1350
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,400
You always know you're a bad guy

1351
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,400
Open the door

1352
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,400
No, mom, I'm trying to keep the same level

1353
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,400
You don't want too much hope and disappointment

1354
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,400
I'm sorry to be missing

1355
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,400
You come back with this

1356
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,400
You, you, you open the door

1357
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,400
I don't

1358
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,400
Shan xin xin

1359
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,400
You block me

1360
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Mom

1361
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,400
Open it

1362
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,400
Open it

1363
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
Mom, you've been keeping me for so many years

1364
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
You're wasting money

1365
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
I count to three

1366
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,400
One

1367
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,400
Two

1368
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,400
Three

1369
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,400
No

1370
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,400
You're a bad guy

1371
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,400
The number you dialed is currently unavailable

1372
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,400
I pulled out the needle again

1373
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
The number you dialed is currently unavailable

1374
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Still can't get through?

1375
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,400
What's going on?

1376
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400
The nurse said her clothes were soiled by her husband

1377
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,400
She asked him to change clothes before coming

1378
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
Why didn't she come back after leaving?

1379
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,400
I thought the relationship between husband and wife was so good

1380
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,400
She didn't come back

1381
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,400
How many times did she pull out the needle?

1382
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,400
Maybe there's something urgent at home

1383
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,400
It's been too long

1384
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
The first bed is already emotional

1385
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,400
What's going on with us?

1386
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,400
Shen Kai, you

1387
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,400
You've worked hard

1388
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,400
Forget it

1389
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,400
Who let me take care of this ward?

1390
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,400
But

1391
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,400
If the family doesn't appear

1392
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,400
Then what happened

1393
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,400
We can't be responsible

1394
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,400
How about this

1395
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,400
I'll try to keep in touch with her family

1396
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,400
You'll have to worry about the first bed

1397
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,400
Okay

1398
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,400
You've worked hard

1399
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,400
I'm fine

1400
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,400
I'm fine

1401
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
I'm fine

1402
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,400
I'm fine

1403
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,400
I'm fine

1404
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,400
I'm fine

1405
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,400
I'm fine

1406
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,400
I'm fine

1407
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
I'm fine

1408
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,400
I'm fine

1409
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,400
I'm fine

1410
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,400
I'm fine

1411
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,400
I'm fine

1412
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,400
I'm fine

1413
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,400
I'm fine

1414
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,400
I'm fine

1415
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,400
I'm fine

1416
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,400
I'm fine

1417
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,400
I'm fine

1418
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,400
I'm fine

1419
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,400
I'm fine

1420
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,400
I'm fine

1421
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,400
I'm fine

1422
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,400

00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
I'm fine

1424
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,400
I'm fine

1425
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,400

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,400

00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,400
