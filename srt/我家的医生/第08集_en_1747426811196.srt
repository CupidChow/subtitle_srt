1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
Okay?

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:06,900
Okay, goodbye

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,940
Ø©

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,980
It is starting

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,140
Is the beginning

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,260
I am sure

7
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,100
for a long time

8
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,640
We will find someone

9
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,000
Who is among the couples

10
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,160
That everyone can relate to

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,280
In one word

12
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,560
It means

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:29,340
and

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,340
I'm a man who always wants to cry for you

15
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,340
I've already written all the love letters in my heart

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,340
No one is more focused than them in the satisfied area

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,340
I'm a man who has been to the highest level of the world

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,340
I'm the first to wake up in the valley

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,340
I'm a man who has been to the highest level of the world

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,340
I'm a man who has been to the highest level of the world

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,340
I've been to the toilet, the toilet is not a big pot

22
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,340
Who opened the door of the hospital?

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,340
The ugly and beautiful aunt or the neighbor's little ghost

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,340
I'm the one who can open my mouth

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,340
My house is like a cotton ball, like the river water

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,340
The university in the middle of the year

27
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,340
There is a white-headed man

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,340
Don't talk to me, don't be angry with me

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,340
The small food has your alcohol, the life can be resolved

30
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,340
I haven't listened to the song, don't open your mouth and say ah yeah

31
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,340
The time is up, the watch is on

32
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,340
Kneel down and watch the watch on the suit

33
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,340
Call a friend and book a seat

34
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,340
The time is up, the watch is on

35
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,340
The L is in the bank tomorrow

36
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,340
I went from Zizhou to Meixi Lake

37
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,340
Watch the game

38
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,340
By the way, your grapes are sour

39
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,340
I guess you saw a child and sold it to you

40
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,340
You go to him tomorrow

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,340
I also bought something else, you wait for me to get it for you

42
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,340
Look, these are all fresh

43
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,340
October 6th

44
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,340
Good, delicious

45
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
Don't eat coke

46
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,340
Beer, coke

47
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,340
Come right now

48
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,340
You have a good attitude today

49
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
You take all the beer, it depends on your mood

50
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,340
Come, coke

51
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,340
You said this book has so much to say, it's so ugly

52
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,340
Yes, don't talk too much

53
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,340
Who do you think they will win

54
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,340
I know this game

55
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,340
Let's change the broadcast

56
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,340
Don't, this process is pretty good

57
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,340
I think you should go to the hospital

58
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,340
Don't, this process is pretty good

59
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,340
Nothing to eat

60
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
Good ball

61
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Not bad, it's really pretty good

62
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,340
Pick up

63
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,340
Hurry up

64
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,340
Nice

65
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,340
You choose the fish or the fish?

66
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,340
OK, three

67
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,340
Don't talk, good ball

68
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
Attention, please stop at the exit

69
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,340
Attention, please stop at the exit

70
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,340
Hello

71
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,340
Now is our lunch break

72
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,340
You sit here for a while

73
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,340
Yes, sit down

74
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,340
OK

75
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,340
This is also a good training

76
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
I'm so tired

77
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
I'm so tired

78
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,340
I'm so tired

79
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,340
I'm so tired

80
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,340
I'm so tired

81
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,340
I'm so tired

82
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,340
I'm so tired

83
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,340
I'm so tired

84
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,340
I'm so tired

85
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,340
I'm so tired

86
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
I'm so tired

87
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,340
I'm so tired

88
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,340
I'm so tired

89
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,340
I'm so tired

90
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,340
I'm so tired

91
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
I'm so tired

92
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,340
I'm so tired

93
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,340
I'm so tired

94
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,340
I'm so tired

95
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,340
I'm so tired

96
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,340
I'm so tired

97
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,340
I'm so tired

98
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,340
I'm so tired

99
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,340
I'm so tired

100
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,340
I'm so tired

101
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,340
I'm so tired

102
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,340
I'm so tired

103
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,340
I'm so tired

104
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,340
I'm so tired

105
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,340
You should listen to me

106
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,340
I'll listen to you

107
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,340
I'll listen to you

108
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,340
I'm coming

109
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,340
Come in

110
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,340
Ms. Qi

111
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,340
Ms. Qi

112
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,340
Ms. Qi

113
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,340
I'm not in a hurry

114
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,340
when your assistant is here

115
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,340
will you do it again?

116
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,340
I can use this computer

117
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,340
The typing is very simple

118
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,340
I don't need to bother them

119
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,340
I usually

120
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,460
At the critical moment

121
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,020
Qi Sheng can use the

122
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,980
Qi Sheng, I'm back

123
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,780
Here comes the master

124
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,660
Don't you know how busy our Chen is?

125
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,500
I can't even see a doctor without him

126
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,620
What did you say just now?

127
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,180
The medicine he took last time was not enough

128
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,540
Please give him more

129
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,660
Yes, yes, yes

130
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,140
Chen

131
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,220
Give his child a box of strong-heated pine

132
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,220
Child

133
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,100
What's wrong?

134
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,540
Qi Sheng, isn't the strong-heated pine...

135
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,980
No problem, open it

136
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,340
Don't worry

137
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,940
It won't be late for you to go home

138
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,140
I know you're in a hurry

139
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,980
to go back

140
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,700
and make a hot pot for your child

141
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,380
Right?

142
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,820
Qi Sheng is so considerate

143
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,740
You must be very happy

144
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,180
to work with Qi Sheng

145
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,980
He is kind and gentle

146
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,620
Yes, he can learn a lot

147
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,900
Qi Sheng is ready

148
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,060
Then you can go to the pharmacy

149
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,340
with your medical card

150
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,580
and take the medicine directly

151
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,300
Okay

152
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
Okay, thank you

153
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,460
Please turn left at 204

154
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,380
That one

155
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,060
You can turn left from the hall

156
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,540
Okay, thank you

157
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,020
Please turn left at 204

158
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,700
and take the medicine directly

159
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,380
Chen, it's almost time for dinner

160
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,700
There are no patients outside

161
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,220
You can finish the record

162
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,820
and go to have dinner early

163
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,500
I'll be back in a minute

164
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,620
Okay, thank you

165
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,100
Come back later

166
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,660
Okay, Qi Sheng

167
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,700
Why did he make such a mess?

168
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,380
How can I go to the pharmacy?

169
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,380
Smile

170
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,380
Okay, very good

171
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,540
You're very perfect

172
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,700
and you're very filial

173
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,700
You're so lucky

174
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,380
You're just in time

175
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,380
If the weather gets cold next week

176
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,940
and the group of people who are anxious come

177
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,500
I'll be so busy

178
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,340
You just perfectly

179
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,460
avoided the peak

180
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,020
Avoid it?

181
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,860
Your treatment

182
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,580
will be completely over this week

183
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,940
You don't have to come for now

184
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,660
And now you can't see anything

185
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,620
I don't have to come

186
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,260
What's wrong?

187
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,140
Are you not happy

188
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,180
that you're getting better?

189
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,780
No

190
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,860
Then, don't I have to

191
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,540
come here a few more times

192
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,620
to make up for it?

193
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,700
No

194
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,740
In this situation

195
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,100
you let him recover

196
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,700
and he'll recover faster than the acupuncture

197
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,340
Miss Shen

198
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,700
I have to go now, Dr. Shen

199
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,940
Look

200
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,900
Your water

201
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,300
So this is a frog

202
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,980
you drew just now?

203
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,380
Great

204
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,820
The frog is so cute

205
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,820
You are so cute

206
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,820
Thank you

207
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
Director, it's time

208
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,820
Let's change shifts

209
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,820
Ten minutes are not enough

210
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
Aren't you going to Yangguang Home later?

211
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
The nurse just called

212
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,820
and said she would be down soon

213
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,820
Ten minutes left

214
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
You can have a drink and have a rest

215
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Okay, you can do it

216
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,820
This is a good one

217
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
I'm a teacher, don't worry

218
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,820
How's the exam?

219
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,820
What's your biggest concern?

220
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
No problem, I've done my review

221
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
Director Ye, let's go

222
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,820
Okay

223
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,820
Nurse

224
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,820
Okay

225
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Director

226
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Here you are

227
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
It's going to rain

228
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Take the umbrella

229
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Guan is so considerate

230
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
The girls upstairs

231
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
are not as considerate as him

232
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
How about I borrow you for a few days?

233
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,820
Okay, no problem

234
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Are you in?

235
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
I'll think about it

236
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,820
Thank you

237
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
It depends on the person

238
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
By the way

239
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,820
if we split the team

240
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
are we leaving on the weekend?

241
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Is this your first time in the team?

242
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,820
I'm tired

243
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
I can stay here for the night

244
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,820
I don't know what to do

245
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,820
Zhao Dengdeng

246
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,820
you have to keep an eye on Zhou Liancheng

247
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Don't let him do

248
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
those troublesome and tiring things again

249
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,820
He's the leader, I'm the guard

250
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,820
I can't control it

251
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
He's the one who's in charge of the team building every year

252
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
Do we have to go there?

253
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
I want to be with Yi Yi on the weekend

254
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,820
Jun

255
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,820
Zhou Hongqi said

256
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
the team building is part of the job

257
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Part of the job

258
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Why do we have to take a break?

259
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
Go

260
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,820
You're not going tomorrow

261
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
You can sleep in the leader's room

262
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,820
How about it?

263
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,820
Yeah, Jun

264
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
I heard it's beautiful there

265
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,820
It's interesting

266
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,820
Yeah

267
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,820
Interesting

268
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,820
Let's talk privately

269
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,820
Don't talk in front of the leader

270
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,820
Here's the menu

271
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,820
Let me see

272
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Zhao

273
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,820
Jun

274
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,820
and his brother

275
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,820
I'll be with Mr. Yu

276
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,820
What's wrong?

277
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,820
What do you think?

278
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,820
He doesn't want to be with you

279
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,820
He's so mean

280
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
I'll be with my brother

281
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,820
So

282
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,820
I'm not in the team

283
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,820
Liu Xing

284
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,820
It's okay

285
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
If you want to be in the team with my brother and Jun

286
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,820
we can switch

287
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Okay

288
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,820
It's settled

289
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,820
What's okay?

290
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
It's his first time to see him not in the same team with me

291
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
I don't care

292
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
You can choose how to play

293
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
Don't say that

294
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
I want to be in the same team with Zhao

295
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Liu Xing, you're not childish

296
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,820
You're like a spring oil

297
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,820
You keep switching

298
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,820
You're not in the same team with us

299
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,820
since you were in the first grade

300
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,820
How can you understand?

301
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
We've been in the same team since we were kids

302
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,820
That's the relationship

303
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,820
I don't want to understand

304
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,820
Jun

305
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,820
How about we switch?

306
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,820
Okay

307
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,820
It's settled

308
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,820
It's settled

309
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,820
I'm in the same team with everyone

310
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,820
You don't want to change?

311
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,820
No

312
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,820
No, he rarely goes

313
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,820
It's annoying to switch with him

314
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,820
The less you are, the more disgusting you are

315
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
I'm just

316
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,820
I'm just a senior

317
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,820
Chen Man, I'm not

318
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
You're a senior, you can go to the next round

319
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Why can't you add this?

320
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
You're so stingy

321
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Are you not used to it?

322
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
We always get the same score

323
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,820
It's so annoying

324
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,820
You've changed so many times

325
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Can't you change a new one?

326
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
There's nothing that can be done

327
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,820
I don't know

328
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
I've been knocking on the door this morning

329
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
It's a mess when the seventh-grader is fine

330
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
The record of the A-L-A-H is messed up again

331
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
I'm the one who gets the complaints

332
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
It's so annoying

333
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
Dr. Qi is old

334
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
It's normal that he can't do it on the computer

335
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,820
He's not good at it

336
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
It's okay if he can't do it on the computer

337
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,820
Do you know

338
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,820
he gave a ten-year-old boy

339
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
a G-sphere

340
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
I knew it was a G-sphere

341
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,820
I didn't know it could be a mistake

342
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
It's a slow-moving puzzle

343
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
I can't lose him

344
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
The current old doctors

345
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
can't learn new knowledge

346
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
and do the old-school experimentalism

347
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
Dr. Qi is so self-disciplined

348
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
I don't think he's a bad doctor

349
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
What do you think?

350
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
I don't understand

351
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,820
The old man of this age

352
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
should stay at home

353
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Every time he opens a door

354
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
someone has to serve him

355
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,820
Dr. Zhao

356
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,820
Where's the water?

357
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Where's the water?

358
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Where's Dr. Qi?

359
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,820
Do you know it's not good

360
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,820
to discuss other people behind their backs?

361
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
If you have any questions

362
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
you can tell Director Yu

363
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
You can tell Director Zhou

364
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
You can also tell me

365
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
We don't listen to

366
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,820
other people's opinions

367
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Put the button down

368
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
We are a big family

369
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
It's not solved

370
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
to discuss other people behind their backs

371
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,820
Do you understand?

372
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
Dr. Zhao, we'll go first

373
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
Chen Minglan

374
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Send the patient's name

375
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,820
to my phone

376
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,820
to open the door

377
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,820
Okay

378
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
It's okay to talk

379
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
Dr. Qi

380
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,820
You are making it difficult for me

381
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
I don't want you to open the back door

382
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,820
I'm just

383
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
doing my job

384
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Yes, yes, yes

385
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Don't be greedy

386
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
You'll lose your good luck

387
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,820
Dr. Qi

388
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,820
You are right

389
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,820
I'm not a good doctor

390
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,820
I'm just a good doctor

391
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,820
I'm just a good doctor

392
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Dr. Qi

393
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
Look, an old doctor like you

394
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
is the best doctor in our hospital

395
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,820
In this community

396
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,820
many children

397
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
are grown up by you

398
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,820
They trust you

399
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,820
and like you

400
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
They...

401
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,820
Don't try to coax me

402
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,820
I know, Zhou Liansheng

403
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
I'm not young anymore

404
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
but I have a lot of complaints

405
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,820
It's not a complaint

406
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,820
You say you are slow in seeing patients

407
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,820
and you don't know how to use computers

408
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
It's not about the doctor

409
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Besides

410
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,820
I'm in the patient department

411
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
I found a little girl for you

412
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,820
to help you

413
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Little girl

414
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,820
Now all the little girls

415
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,820
like to drink milk tea

416
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Xiao Chen bought it for me once

417
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,820
It's so delicious

418
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,820
Later

419
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
I couldn't help but buy it secretly

420
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,820
but I couldn't drink it often

421
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
After all, I'm not a little girl

422
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,820
The blood is slow

423
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,820
If the blood sugar goes up

424
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,820
the diabetes will be worse

425
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,820
and you will be in trouble

426
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
It will be difficult to get better

427
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,820
People

428
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
can't live without their parents

429
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
Zhou Liansheng, I'm old

430
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,820
Yes, yes, yes

431
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,820
We are all old

432
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,820
OK

433
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,820
I'll go back

434
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Director Qu

435
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,820
Sister Lili

436
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
I know you have to call me that

437
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
How old are you?

438
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,820
Are you embarrassed?

439
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,820
Why should I be embarrassed?

440
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
I've been calling you for more than ten years

441
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,820
I've never seen you be embarrassed

442
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,020
How many

443
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
are you in the near future?

444
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,820
Have you reached your goal?

445
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,820
Almost, almost

446
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,820
It's almost there

447
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
So

448
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
Almost, almost

449
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
I've been listening for years

450
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
I'll just change my name

451
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,820
to Zhou Happy

452
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,820
How can you say that?

453
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,820
What is happy?

454
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,820
Happy, happy

455
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
People will think I'm going to die

456
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
when they hear it

457
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,820
No, no, no

458
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
We all have to live a long life

459
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
live a healthy life

460
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,820
Am I right?

461
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Yes, yes, yes

462
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
So

463
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,820
Director

464
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,820
It's such a happy decision

465
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Bye

466
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
Sister Lili

467
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,820
98

468
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Two police officers

469
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
I'm so used to it

470
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
It's the last day off today

471
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,820
I have a day off tomorrow

472
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,820
I'll do more work today

473
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,820
I'm so tired

474
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,820
I'm so tired

475
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,820
I'm so tired

476
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,820
I'm so tired

477
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,820
I'm so tired

478
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,820
I'm so tired

479
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,820
What are you doing?

480
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,820
I'm busy with you

481
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,820
Do you think

482
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Xiao Guan

483
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,820
is a little bit

484
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,820
lonely recently?

485
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,820
What's wrong with him?

486
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,820
Xiao Guan, I'll tell you

487
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Sister Cai must like you

488
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,820
Who likes him?

489
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,820
Sister Cai

490
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Doctor Zhao, you're so generous

491
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
Just now

492
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Sister Cai was reluctant

493
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
to give him more fried chicken

494
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
because Xiao Guan

495
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,820
made one in advance

496
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,820
Sister Cai's mother

497
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
is in Qingcheng

498
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
She wants to eat Sister Cai's

499
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,820
signature dishes

500
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,820
Thank you, Xiao Guan

501
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Doctor Zhao

502
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Xiao Guan was

503
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,820
being mean to Sister Cai

504
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
No

505
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,820
I'm off work

506
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Let's go and pack up

507
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,820
I've been

508
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,820
talking to you

509
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,820
all the time

510
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,820
No

511
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820
This fan

512
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
This is also from your family

513
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,820
We gave it to each of us

514
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
There's one in this fan

515
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Yes

516
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,820
All of them are from your family

517
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
Let's go

518
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,820
Director, we'll go now

519
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
The computer has been upgraded, right?

520
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Have you kept

521
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
all the information?

522
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,820
Yes

523
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,820
Bye, Doctor Zhao

524
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Go

525
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,820
Young people are so enthusiastic now

526
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
They're enthusiastic about them

527
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
and you

528
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,820
I'm off

529
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,820
Are you leaving?

530
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,820
No, I'm done with my work

531
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
It's still half past two tomorrow

532
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Are you going?

533
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,820
I'll think about it

534
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,820
Your attitude is a little bad

535
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,820
I'm home

536
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,820
You're back

537
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,820
Shen Er is coming back soon

538
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
Don't send him back

539
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
Why are you up so early today?

540
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
I have something to do in the morning

541
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
I'm off

542
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,820
Breakfast

543
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,820
Remember to eat it

544
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
You're leaving now?

545
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,820
Where are you going?

546
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,820
I'm late

547
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
I'll tell you later

548
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,820
Director Yu

549
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
Are you waiting for me in the car?

550
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,820
I would have left if you hadn't come

551
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
I brought you breakfast on purpose

552
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,820
What breakfast?

553
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,820
I'll find a place to eat after the inspection

554
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,820
You're so considerate

555
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
You're so considerate

556
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,820
I did it especially for you

557
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
Thank you so much

558
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,820
I have to do something good

559
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,820
for you

560
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,820
I'm leaving now

561
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,820
I'm leaving now

562
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,820
I'm leaving now

563
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,820
I'm leaving now

564
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,820
I'm leaving now

565
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,820
I'm leaving now

566
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,820
I'm leaving now

567
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,820
I'm leaving now

568
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,820
You have to tell me everything

569
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,820
about the good things you did

570
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,820
I have to tell you everything

571
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,820
about the good things I did

572
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,820
Do I have to

573
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,820
send you a warning letter?

574
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,820
Sure

575
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,820
Why don't you go to my office?

576
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,820
Why don't you go to

577
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,820
Zhou Lian Sheng's office?

578
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,820
Get in the car

579
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
Dr. Luo

580
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,820
Dr. Zhao asked for leave this morning

581
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,820
Dr. Zheng took over his shift

582
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,820
See if you need any help

583
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,820
This is the schedule for next week

584
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,820
What a coincidence

585
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,820
You all asked for leave today

586
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Please

587
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,820
Don't say that again

588
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,820
Why are you so angry?

589
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,820
You've been busy recently

590
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,820
You're free today

591
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
I'll check with you

592
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,820
I have to pay you no matter how busy you are

593
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,820
What's the situation with you recently?

594
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,820
I don't want to tell you

595
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,820
It's a secret

596
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,820
I can't hear you

597
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,820
You're crazy

598
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,820
I almost missed it

599
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
You didn't go to the ward to see me

600
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,820
You're so busy

601
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,820
We were in a hurry today

602
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,820
No, I was just about to

603
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,820
take her to see you

604
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,820
This is the food my relatives

605
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,820
have been waiting for

606
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,820
I know you came today

607
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,820
I prepared it on purpose

608
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,820
Take it back to your mom

609
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820
Thank her for the chili radish

610
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,820
Thank you, sister

611
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,820
But my mom's chili radish

612
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,820
is nothing special

613
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,820
You misunderstood me

614
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,820
If you want to come back

615
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,820
I don't need your mom to send me something

616
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,820
I'll send her

617
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,820
anything

618
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
Don't laugh

619
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,820
I'm serious

620
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,820
You're checking it again and again

621
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,820
The indicators are normal

622
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,820
Think about it

623
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,820
Let her think about it

624
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,820
I'll ask her seriously

625
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,820
She can't do it now

626
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,820
Right?

627
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,820
She checks with you every year

628
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,820
I envy you have such a friend

629
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,820
You never thought about

630
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,820
development

631
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,820
I'll wait for you

632
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,820
in the hospital

633
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
I'll wait for you

634
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,820
Then I'll wait for you

635
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
Ok

636
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,820
I'll wait for you

637
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,820
Don't joke around

638
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
Bye, sister

639
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,820
She laughed at me

640
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,820
I'll consider it

641
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,820
Bye

642
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,820
Bye

643
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,980
Xie Xie, you go home every day.

644
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,420
You can't drink milk tea every day.

645
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,700
Thanks to you, I can drink milk tea today.

646
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,140
You don't know how anxious I am at home.

647
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,420
You don't let me drink it.

648
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,020
Why do you drink lemon water?

649
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,980
I don't drink sweet things at night.

650
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,380
You are so old.

651
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,460
I can't care about that.

652
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,300
Nothing is more important than making yourself happy.

653
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,300
Dr. Qi.

654
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,500
I'm sorry.

655
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,340
I heard you will retire next week.

656
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,260
You have been working so hard for so many years.

657
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,340
Someone must have made you unhappy.

658
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,580
I was the one who was your assistant last week.

659
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,020
If you are unhappy, it must be me.

660
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,140
I didn't mean to do that.

661
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,700
If I did something wrong,

662
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,420
I would be sorry for you.

663
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,060
Enough.

664
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,980
You are too impatient.

665
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,020
You are so stubborn.

666
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,100
I didn't say anything.

667
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,620
I haven't finished.

668
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,300
Go on.

669
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,140
I admit that I said bad things about you.

670
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,100
Zhao Yisheng explained it to me.

671
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,980
You gave him a strong beating

672
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,780
because he has a system of red blood cells.

673
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,140
You helped him control the amount of medicine.

674
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,420
I shouldn't have said that.

675
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,020
It's useless.

676
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,140
I will retire anyway.

677
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,740
I told Zhou before that

678
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,860
I had nothing to do with you.

679
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,780
Look at you.

680
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,380
I won't laugh at you.

681
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,580
Dr. Qi.

682
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,060
It's not because of me.

683
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,380
I have a little thing to do with you.

684
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,940
What is it?

685
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,500
We are old.

686
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,780
We should give chance to young people.

687
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,460
We shouldn't cause trouble for young people.

688
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,380
I feel sad

689
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,500
to see you like this.

690
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,380
You kids

691
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,740
are the funniest.

692
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,220
You sympathize with us.

693
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,260
It's not good to be young.

694
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,380
I don't miss

695
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,700
myself at that time.

696
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,020
I was young at that time.

697
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,540
I was thin and real.

698
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,100
I was told by others.

699
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,020
I cried for a long time.

700
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,500
Now you are talking about me.

701
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,140
So what?

702
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,460
I have known my fate.

703
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,380
I was a dentist at the age of 19.

704
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,540
I ran around with the incense.

705
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,140
Now I remember

706
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,380
I was so busy.

707
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,620
I was so busy.

708
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,860
Now

709
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,660
I have nothing to be afraid of.

710
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,540
What else?

711
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,980
Zhou Liansheng showed me the way.

712
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,340
I left immediately

713
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,500
and went to the next hospital.

714
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,420
It all depends on time.

715
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,060
Mr. Zhou, are you going to tell your mom?

716
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,100
What's the use of telling her?

717
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,180
I think you should tell her.

718
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,580
Otherwise she will worry.

719
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,220
Don't worry so much.

720
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,660
You are here every day.

721
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,420
Shouldn't I be in charge of this?

722
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,460
Go.

723
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,060
It's going to rain heavily.

724
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,460
Take it.

725
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,460
What's wrong?

726
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,260
I brought an umbrella.

727
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:15,860
No.

728
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,060
It's not necessary.

729
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,260
It's not necessary.

730
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,460
It's not necessary.

731
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,660
It's not necessary.

732
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,100
You brought an umbrella.

733
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,860
After you go back,

734
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,140
take the medicine on time.

735
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,820
OK.

736
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,580
If you have any problem,

737
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,420
you can call or come directly.

738
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,260
OK.

739
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,540
Take the umbrella.

740
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:31,820
OK.

741
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,340
Thank you, little Guanyin.

742
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,540
Goodbye.

743
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,580
Good job.

744
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,340
I praise you.

745
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,500
You have this awareness.

746
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,380
Go.

747
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,940
So much nonsense.

748
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,420
Zhang Youzhi.

749
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,660
You are 52 years old.

750
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,260
I'm over 25 years old.

751
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,740
I was an old doctor last time.

752
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,860
I must have made a mistake.

753
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,460
No.

754
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,260
Maybe you are a newbie.

755
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,060
Let me see.

756
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,260
Here.

757
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,860
Turn around.

758
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,060
You have a little inflammation.

759
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,660
Yes.

760
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,660
It's almost a week.

761
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,860
I have prescribed you some medicine.

762
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,060
You can wash your face and apply it.

763
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,660
OK.

764
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,260
Thank you.

765
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,060
Little Guanyin.

766
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,860
Don't drink too much.

767
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,660
Don't drink too much.

768
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
Don't drink too much.

769
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
Don't drink too much.

770
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,660
OK.

771
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,660
Guanyin.

772
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,260
Help me to check the computer.

773
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,060
What's wrong?

774
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,260
Why doesn't it move?

775
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,060
It's just a little loose.

776
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,860
Look.

777
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,060
Let me try.

778
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,260
No.

779
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,060
Why is it like this?

780
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,860
Why is my computer broken?

781
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,660
Is the computer poisoned?

782
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,260
Mine is not working either.

783
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,060
Mine is broken too.

784
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,660
Why is it like this?

785
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,460
Mine is also broken.

786
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,060
Mine is also broken.

787
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,260
I just wrote a music report.

788
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:03,860
Me too.

789
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,260
I just typed something.

790
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,460
I didn't understand it.

791
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,460
I didn't understand it.

792
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,060
How can you understand it?

793
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,260
You are so stupid.

794
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,460
You are so stupid.

795
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,260
What should we do now?

796
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,460
Don't follow me.

797
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,660
I'm afraid that there is a fee for the operation.

798
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,660
I think there is something that needs help.

799
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,860
OK.

800
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,260
Director.

801
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,660
What's wrong with the computer?

802
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,260
Don't worry.

803
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,060
I've called them.

804
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,460
They will solve it soon.

805
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,060
Doctor.

806
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,260
How can it be?

807
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,460
We've been waiting for a long time.

808
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,860
I'm so sorry.

809
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,860
I'll go and check it for you.

810
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,860
OK.

811
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,660
Dr. Qi.

812
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,060
I've informed the software.

813
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,460
They will solve the problem immediately.

814
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,060
Don't worry.

815
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,460
I can solve it.

816
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,060
Please help me to

817
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,260
calm the patient waiting outside.

818
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,660
OK.

819
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,860
Thank you.

820
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,860
Let me have a look.

821
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
Look.

822
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,460
Now that he is old,

823
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,260
his memory will be deformed.

824
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,460
If he was young,

825
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,460
I remember

826
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,060
how many times he had this disease.

827
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,660
What's wrong?

828
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,460
We've been waiting for a long time.

829
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,460
Can we see the disease?

830
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,660
I'm really sorry.

831
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,060
There is a problem with the computer.

832
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,860
But it doesn't matter.

833
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,860
I can call the artificial number.

834
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,860
Please give me the medical record

835
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,460
and the number plate.

836
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460
Director Cheng.

837
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,460
Go and check if Dr. Qi

838
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,660
needs any help.

839
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,260
OK.

840
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:14,860
Give it to me.

841
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,060
Thank you, Dr. Qi.

842
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,260
If the hospital's network

843
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,460
is not good,

844
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,860
my notebook

845
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,460
will be useless.

846
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,460
Now everyone uses computers.

847
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,260
All kinds of data

848
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,460
and check results

849
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,260
are stored in computers.

850
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,060
At that time,

851
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,460
technology was not so advanced.

852
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,060
How could the conditions be so good?

853
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,860
The patient is a brain-savvy.

854
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,660
It's basically an experience.

855
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,660
Yes.

856
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,060
Young people now

857
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,660
can't live without a mobile computer.

858
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,260
Like the old man,

859
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
he can't use

860
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,860
a car or a horse.

861
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,060
If you open it slowly,

862
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,660
you will be disliked.

863
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,660
If you take a taxi,

864
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,260
it's also in your mobile phone.

865
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,460
Sometimes you can't even see the map.

866
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,860
You don't even know where the car is.

867
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,660
Yes.

868
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,060
If we can understand each other,

869
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,060
it would be great.

870
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,260
Young people help the elderly.

871
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,060
Just like my assistant, Chen.

872
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,460
The elderly also teach young people.

873
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,060
Then the society

874
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:12,460
will be more harmonious and happy.

875
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,660
I found it.

876
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,860
Your blood test last time

877
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,860
was very good.

878
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,060
The changes are not big.

879
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,260
I remember that you had

880
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,660
the operation for almost two and a half years.

881
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,660
I found it early.

882
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,260
The operation was successful.

883
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,260
Believe me, it's okay.

884
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,060
Don't be so nervous.

885
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,860
Be brave.

886
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Thank you, Dr. Qi.

887
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,060
I won't bother you.

888
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,660
You're welcome.

889
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,660
Okay.

890
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,060
Here.

891
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,860
Here.

892
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,260
Dr. Qi.

893
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,060
This is for you.

894
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,060
Dr. Qi,

895
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,060
I'll help you today.

896
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,860
I used to help with computers.

897
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,060
Now,

898
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,660
you see,

899
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,460
Dr. Qi remembers everything.

900
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,260
But I

901
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,660
feel like I still have a lot to learn.

902
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,660
I found it.

903
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,860
Look.

904
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,260
Your blood pressure is much better.

905
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,260
Just take the medicine on time.

906
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,260
It's okay.

907
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,060
Why did you change another one?

908
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,060
Right.

909
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,860
Shu's daughter is taking the exam.

910
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,260
Chen Minglan and Gao Yang want to be a team.

911
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,660
I want to be with the patient.

912
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,460
So I changed them all.

913
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,660
Who agreed to change them?

914
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,860
I changed them with Jun.

915
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,460
But why did you change them?

916
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,660
We changed them.

917
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,060
Then I became a team with Xiaoxu.

918
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,460
I knew you wanted to be a team with Xiaoxu.

919
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,060
So I went to the leader.

920
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,660
Now it's good.

921
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,260
You can be a team.

922
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,260
We are a team.

923
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,060
But you're alone now.

924
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,660
Right.

925
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,660
You're making trouble.

926
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,260
You're alone.

927
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,060
I'm alone.

928
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,460
Why are you so surprised?

929
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,460
You're not alone.

930
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,260
Why are you so surprised?

931
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,060
You changed them.

932
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,060
What should we do now?

933
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,860
No.

934
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,460
Liu Qing.

935
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,260
You said you wanted to change them.

936
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:11,660
Right.

937
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,060
You said it first.

938
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,860
You have to follow us.

939
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,460
I have to change them.

940
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,460
You have to follow us.

941
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,060
Stop.

942
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,060
It's useless to say these things now.

943
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,060
Chief Chen said

944
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,460
team building is a team activity.

945
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,660
We have to obey the central arrangement.

946
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,860
We can't go wherever we want.

947
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,660
We can't change them now.

948
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,060
What should we do

949
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,860
if Jun is alone?

950
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,660
I'll talk to Chief Chen.

951
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,260
I'll go with you.

952
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,660
No.

953
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,460
You don't have to go with Jun.

954
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,060
No.

955
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,060
Don't make it complicated.

956
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
It's simple.

957
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,060
Believe me.

958
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,060
I can do it.

959
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,260
I can't.

960
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,260
I want to team building with you.

961
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,660
Yi Yi.

962
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,660
What?

963
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,060
Can I ask you for a leave?

964
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,060
I'm going to team building this weekend.

965
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,260
So I want to send you to

966
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,460
your grandparents' place.

967
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,860
Is that okay?

968
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,460
Team building?

969
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,660
It's a team trip.

970
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,060
Will Brother Yi Sen

971
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,660
go with you?

972
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,660
Brother Yi Sen

973
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,460
won't go with me.

974
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,660
They'll go next time.

975
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,260
Children with good relationships

976
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,260
play together.

977
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,060
Yes.

978
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,060
But think about it.

979
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,660
Brother Yi Sen

980
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,660
just found his brother.

981
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,260
And he has known

982
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,860
Yu Shi and Brother Liu Jin

983
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
for a long time.

984
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,860
So they'll go together.

985
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,860
But I'll go with someone else.

986
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,060
But don't worry.

987
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,060
I'll have fun

988
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,660
just like you.

989
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,460
Really?

990
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,260
Yes.

991
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:52,860
I'm so tired.

992
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,060
Get in the car.

993
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,060
Get in the car.

994
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,660
Come on.

995
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,460
Let's go.

996
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,060
Dr. Zhang.

997
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:04,860
Do you need help?

998
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,060
No.

999
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,660
I can do it.

1000
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,260
You have so many things.

1001
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,060
No, I don't.

1002
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,860
I can do it myself.

1003
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,460
You can get in the car first.

1004
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:10,660
Okay?

1005
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,860
We'll drive soon.

1006
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,860
Okay, let's get in the car.

1007
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,260
Okay.

1008
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,660
Okay.

1009
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,460
No, no.

1010
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,060
I...

1011
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,660
Xiao Xu.

1012
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,260
Brother Jun.

1013
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,860
He's young.

1014
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,860
You can help him.

1015
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,060
Good morning, Brother Jun.

1016
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,060
Yu Shi.

1017
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,460
What's going on?

1018
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,060
You...

1019
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,860
Where's Liu Jin?

1020
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,660
Why are you late again?

1021
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,260
Don't talk nonsense.

1022
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,460
I'm not late today.

1023
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,060
Brother Jun.

1024
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,060
You...

1025
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,860
Why are you doing this?

1026
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,860
Didn't you say that

1027
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,660
you would go to the assistant director

1028
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,660
to ask for help next week?

1029
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,460
How could we

1030
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,460
leave you alone?

1031
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,060
So we just

1032
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,260
changed the money.

1033
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,460
But you can't miss

1034
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,460
the experience of 800 times.

1035
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,460
I'll write it.

1036
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,260
I can even read your Chinese.

1037
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,460
Really?

1038
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:57,860
Let's go.

1039
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,860
Let's go.

1040
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,460
Come on.

1041
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,060
I understand.

1042
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,660
Get in the car.

1043
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,060
Hurry up.

1044
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,660
Hurry up.

1045
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,460
Get out.

1046
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,260
Get in the car.

1047
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,860
Hurry up.

1048
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,060
Don't waste time.

1049
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,260
All the team,

1050
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,860
happy.

1051
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,660
Ready.

1052
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,260
Go.

1053
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,260
Get in the car.

1054
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,860
Hurry up.

1055
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,260
Go.

1056
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,060
Hurry up.

1057
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,660
Hurry up.

1058
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,860
Hurry up.

1059
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,460
Hurry up.

1060
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,260
Hurry up.

1061
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:26,860
Hurry up.

1062
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,460
Hurry up.

1063
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,860
Hurry up.

1064
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,460
Hurry up.

1065
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:30,860
Go.

1066
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,860
We like to

1067
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,660
live in the same room.

1068
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,260
No, we two

1069
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:35,860
are not that close.

1070
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,660
We can share the room.

1071
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:38,660
Sister.

1072
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,060
Watch the phone.

1073
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,460
Listen to me.

1074
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,060
Today is a group activity.

1075
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,860
Don't make trouble for me.

1076
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,460
Director.

1077
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,660
Is this our first time to meet in a group?

1078
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,660
You don't know me.

1079
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,660
We are so good.

1080
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,060
Just...

1081
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,660
I'm the captain.

1082
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,860
I'm the first.

1083
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,660
Watch the phone.

1084
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,060
There is news in the group.

1085
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,660
Come to gather time.

1086
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,060
Follow up.

1087
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,660
Follow up.

1088
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,060
Yes.

1089
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,460
Are you all off?

1090
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,060
No.

1091
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,860
Hurry up.

1092
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,660
Don't fall asleep.

1093
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,060
You have to put the card in her mouth.

1094
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,660
Director.

1095
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,460
Did you see it?

1096
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,860
This is the key to focus on the target.

1097
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,860
Let's go, director.

1098
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,460
Go.

1099
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:26,860
Go.

1100
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,260
Don't forget.

1101
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,860
Come to see the news in the group.

1102
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,860
The sound of the music is still echoing.

1103
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,860
It's like a hero in my eyes.

1104
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,660
Sing it.

1105
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,060
Okay.

1106
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,260
Okay.

1107
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,060
Cut it.

1108
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,460
Whose next song is it?

1109
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,060
No one sings it.

1110
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,660
I'll cut it.

1111
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,060
Mine.

1112
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,660
Don't cut it.

1113
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,460
I'll sing it.

1114
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
This is a man and woman team.

1115
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,060
No one sings it with you.

1116
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,660
Right.

1117
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,260
I'll sing it.

1118
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,260
I'll sing it.

1119
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,460
I'll sing that.

1120
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,260
Mr. Zhou, don't sing it.

1121
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,660
Only the young people sing it.

1122
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,460
Just two lines.

1123
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,060
Just two lines.

1124
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,660
Come on.

1125
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,060
Go.

1126
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,860
You guys.

1127
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,260
You sing it well.

1128
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,260
Who hasn't been young?

1129
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:12,860
Let's go.

1130
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,260
Let's go.

1131
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:13,860
Let's go.

1132
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,860
Let's go.

1133
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,260
Go to the city.

1134
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,260
You're sleeping?

1135
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,060
None of your business.

1136
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,860
The leader is behind you.

1137
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,460
Shut up.

1138
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,460
You're so annoying.

1139
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,460
You're so annoying.

1140
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,460
Why are you so annoying?

1141
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,260
I'll give you some barbecue.

1142
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,060
I grilled it.

1143
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,460
Teacher.

1144
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,460
You don't want to eat it?

1145
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,060
No.

1146
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,860
No.

1147
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,860
Jun.

1148
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,060
Do you want to ask Zhou to treat us?

1149
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,260
Guys.

1150
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
The director wants to treat us to something.

1151
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,060
Why're they LIVE?

1152
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,260
We'll take your time.

1153
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,660
No, today we can't be chatty like that.

1154
00:37:46,660 --> 00:38:01,340
Just

1155
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,540
I'll give you a little victory.

1156
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,860
Come on.

1157
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,460
Here, common feet.

1158
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,580
Take it

1159
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,700
What's the special?

1160
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,820
You'll know it later

1161
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,540
We can't let the director

1162
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,860
have one year of leave

1163
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,260
At least three times, right?

1164
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,300
Yes

1165
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,260
Mr. He

1166
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,060
I have to support my family

1167
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,300
Lan, what's this?

1168
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,300
Isn't this our local green plum wine?

1169
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,660
I saw Lan

1170
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,820
She's so sincere

1171
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,220
Did you make it yourself?

1172
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,100
Dr. Qi made it last year

1173
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,660
I brought it for you

1174
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,260
Great

1175
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,260
It's a farewell gift

1176
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,220
Everyone

1177
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,900
has his or her own time

1178
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,180
We all experience

1179
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,700
the same thing in the workplace

1180
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,500
Did you get infected on the way?

1181
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,300
We don't know

1182
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,820
You should teach the rules

1183
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,100
Okay

1184
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,340
Stand there

1185
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,900
Lan, don't be afraid

1186
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
Mom

1187
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,980
Don't touch it if you don't know how to do it

1188
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,340
The doctor said

1189
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,460
if you get infected with hand-to-hand contact

1190
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,980
you should cut off your hands

1191
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,500
Doctor

1192
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,820
I've been waiting for you to eat this

1193
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,380
Do you have money to sign the contract?

1194
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,820
I can't cure my disease

1195
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,220
Mr. He, I've explained

1196
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,140
the contract many times

1197
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,380
You can sign it if you want

1198
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,580
I want to know

1199
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,340
what's the benefit of signing the contract

1200
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,940
I've explained it to you

1201
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,100
very clearly

1202
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,380
I don't have

1203
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,620
better medicine

1204
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,700
I think

1205
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,340
This is a hospital

1206
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,940
Can you be quiet?

1207
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,220
I hope you can give me

1208
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,580
some new medicine

1209
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,540
Because I've been eating for so many years

1210
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,460
The medicine doesn't work

1211
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,780
Uncle, the medicine is

1212
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,820
the responsibility of the whole department

1213
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,740
We are only responsible for signing the contract

1214
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,140
I'm not familiar with others

1215
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,300
I'm a little more familiar with you

1216
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,540
No, you come here

1217
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,700
Uncle, here's the thing

1218
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,460
What we're talking about today

1219
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,820
is the contract

1220
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,660
Okay?

1221
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,780
If you want to sign

1222
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,820
we'll tell you

1223
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,420
the specific operation of the contract

1224
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,420
And you go to the whole department

1225
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,500
to find the medicine

1226
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,660
We're not responsible for it

1227
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,260
Do you understand?

1228
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:03,980
Do you understand?

1229
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,540
What's the benefit of signing the contract?

1230
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,700
I haven't figured it out

1231
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,820
Do you have money?

1232
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,860
You haven't said it

1233
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,380
It's nothing big

1234
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,180
Don't think too much

1235
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,700
Don't scare yourself

1236
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,980
These are all

1237
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,940
from other people

1238
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,180
It's not that scary

1239
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,980
Let me show you this needle

1240
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,940
Look

1241
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,500
Look at this needle

1242
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,060
Right?

1243
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,460
It looks like nothing

1244
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,220
Such a fine needle

1245
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,020
It's actually not

1246
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,780
on the body

1247
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,260
Brother, I haven't stabbed you yet

1248
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,980
Why are you dizzy?

1249
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,420
Brother, can you hear me?

1250
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,900
Brother, wake up

1251
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,860
Let me help you

1252
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,460
Okay

1253
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,700
We should do it

1254
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,700
With the accumulation of time and time

1255
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,700
We gradually become

1256
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,700
a peaceful and honest life

1257
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,700
With the loss of time

1258
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,700
We will be like the God of Go

1259
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,700
and face the day of retirement

1260
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,700
But we know now

1261
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,700
the beginning of a new life

1262
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,700
is a better day

1263
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,700
Okay

1264
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,700
I've completed the task

1265
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,700
Okay

1266
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Uncle Yue, you're drunk

1267
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,700
You're everywhere

1268
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,700
Something's wrong

1269
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,700
Uncle, where are you going?

1270
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,700
To the toilet

1271
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,700
It's so dark outside

1272
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,700
Take this

1273
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,700
You have good equipment

1274
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,700
Dr. Qi's wine is really good

1275
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,700
I'm going to the toilet

1276
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,700
Why are you here?

1277
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,700
I

1278
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,700
I'm so cold

1279
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,700
Why are you following me?

1280
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
I saw you went to the toilet

1281
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,700
It's dark and it's hard to walk

1282
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,700
I'm afraid you'll be in danger

1283
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,700
Who knows you're wearing

1284
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,700
a handkerchief with a wolf's hand?

1285
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,700
What's wrong?

1286
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,700
It's gone

1287
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Your eyes are so wide open

1288
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,700
Get up

1289
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,700
Hurry up, close your eyes

1290
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,700
It's okay, you're...

1291
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,700
This is temporary

1292
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,700
Don't rub it

1293
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,700
Just close your eyes

1294
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,700
Close your eyes for a while

1295
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,700
It'll be fine in a while

1296
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,700
You're so good

1297
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,700
You didn't even shout all the way

1298
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,700
Are you okay, Uncle?

1299
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,700
I'm fine

1300
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,700
Who's stupid?

1301
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,700
I'm not stupid

1302
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,700
Don't rub it

1303
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,700
Are you feeling better?

1304
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,700
Not completely

1305
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,700
Close your eyes for a while

1306
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,700
What should we do?

1307
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,700
Dr. Qi is a good person

1308
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,700
How about we prepare

1309
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,700
something for him

1310
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,700
when he retires?

1311
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,700
How about giving him

1312
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,700
a salary this month?

1313
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,700
We don't have the salary

1314
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,700
Shall we thank the letter first

1315
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,700
and sign it together?

1316
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,700
Sure

1317
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,700
Let's think about it

1318
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,700
When Dr. Qi leaves

1319
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,700
what should we prepare for him?

1320
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,700
We can hold

1321
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,700
a farewell party for him

1322
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,700
Yes

1323
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,700
I think

1324
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,700
the farewell party is not so good

1325
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,700
Dr. Qi is so low-key

1326
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,700
He's too over the top

1327
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,340
It's too much

1328
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:04,980
Yeah

1329
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,020
Actually, I think

1330
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:06,500
what you said just now

1331
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,620
is good

1332
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,580
Yeah, it's just

1333
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,420
write a thank-you letter

1334
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,420
and sign it together

1335
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,300
Right?

1336
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,020
It's a good thing

1337
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,020
It's good

1338
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,580
Write it

1339
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,580
You write it?

1340
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,500
You didn't take my pen

1341
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,700
when you were in the sixth grade of primary school

1342
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,100
You're making a fuss

1343
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,780
You write it so formally

1344
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,420
Do you have a pen?

1345
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,220
Dear

1346
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,500
Li

1347
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,900
Li

1348
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,860
Happy New Year

1349
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,220
You don't have to

1350
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,500
work early to get a card

1351
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,820
No problem

1352
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,700
I prescribed you some medicine

1353
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,380
Remember to take it on time

1354
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,620
It will be cured soon

1355
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,700
Don't worry

1356
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,100
Here, take it

1357
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,500
If you miss me in the future

1358
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:50,820
I'm sorry

1359
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,180
you must come back to see me

1360
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,580
Because in other places

1361
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,820
you can't see

1362
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,900
my handsome face

1363
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,060
When I was a kid

1364
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,100
I had a fever, headache, and a fever

1365
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,700
You gave me all the diseases

1366
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,660
If you call me

1367
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,780
if you have any small diseases

1368
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,260
I'll be here as soon as possible

1369
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,940
No, no

1370
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,820
Dr. Qi, thank you

1371
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,460
You're doing well in retirement

1372
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,220
I envy you

1373
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,420
You haven't seen

1374
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,980
our public health department yet

1375
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:16,900
Dr. Qi

1376
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,540
if you want to drink milk tea

1377
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,820
come to the hospital

1378
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,300
I know which milk tea is the best

1379
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,420
Sister Li

1380
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,020
I don't want to

1381
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,540
recruit people again

1382
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,140
Do you want to think about it again?

1383
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,100
Do it again

1384
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,620
Dr. Qi

1385
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,620
I want to express my gratitude to you

1386
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,100
on behalf of all the residents of Qingshan Green Water

1387
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,260
Thank you for your contribution

1388
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,420
to safeguard their health

1389
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,700
Sister Li Li

1390
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,500
We need you

1391
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,140
Time is fair to everyone

1392
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,140
We get old every day

1393
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,340
and we will meet loss and separation

1394
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,420
The story is wonderful

1395
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,620
and there is a end

1396
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,580
But it doesn't matter

1397
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,140
Maybe our life on the stage

1398
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,580
has just begun

1399
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,700
Goodbye, Dr. Qi

1400
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,540
Goodbye

1401
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,060
Dr. Qi, you're off work

1402
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:19,860
I'm off work

1403
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,100
Dr. Qi

1404
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,540
It's cold outside

1405
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,100
Yes, it's cold outside

1406
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:24,620
Yes

1407
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,940
Dr. Qi, your coat looks great

1408
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,740
Does it?

1409
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,260
Yes

1410
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,740
You've been here for a long time

1411
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,660
Yes

1412
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,940
It's beautiful and warm

1413
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,740
It's beautiful

1414
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,260
I'm waiting for the weather to cool down

1415
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,340
I'm so hot

1416
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,980
I finally have a chance today

1417
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,380
I'm leaving

1418
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,740
OK, goodbye, Dr. Qi

1419
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,740
Goodbye

1420
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,660
Goodbye, Dr. Qi

1421
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,580
You're leaving like this?

1422
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,580
You just quit

1423
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,620
after the meeting?

1424
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,060
Dr. Qi said

1425
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,460
he has been off work for decades

1426
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,540
Today is just a normal day off

1427
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,540
Time takes away our precious things

1428
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,140
Young, energetic, healthy

1429
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,460
But time also gives us experience

1430
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,500
maturity and will

1431
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,340
Time gives you not only a lot of money

1432
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,460
but also the life you have in your heart

1433
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,820
and the way you walk down the road

1434
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,340
We give time to

1435
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,540
the gift that it gives us

1436
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,140
no matter where we go

1437
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,300
Ninth time

1438
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,100
It's only one step away from the long journey

1439
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,380
You're off work

1440
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,300
I'm leaving now

1441
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,860
Chen

1442
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,740
Thank you for helping me to carry the wine

1443
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,900
Dr. Qi especially gave you a gift

1444
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,620
You should work harder in the future

1445
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,500
So much money?

1446
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,900
The older I get, the more valuable I am

1447
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,980
I want to grow old

1448
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,420
I want to make money

1449
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,500
Lin

1450
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,540
Lin

1451
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:39,740
Lin

1452
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,020
Don't scare me

1453
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,220
What's going on?

1454
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,300
Be quiet

1455
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,820
Don't be dizzy

1456
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,260
Why are you dizzy?

1457
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,860
You're lucky to be in the hospital

1458
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,860
If you were out there

1459
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,620
I would be

1460
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,860
I would be blind to you

1461
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,180
It's okay

1462
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,100
Aunt Lin

1463
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,060
Uncle Li

1464
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:00,980
Don't worry

1465
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,380
My uncle fainted because of low blood sugar

1466
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,500
He ate a lot of lychee

1467
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,140
and had blood sugar drop

1468
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:09,980
Look

1469
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,700
What did you drop?

1470
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,260
So it has nothing to do with where he fainted

1471
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,220
The point is

1472
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,540
you can't eat

1473
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,140
such a lot of high sugar food

1474
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,700
in the future

1475
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,300
Do you know?

1476
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:22,780
I know

1477
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,700
Are you sick?

1478
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,660
The hospital has advised you to eat and drink

1479
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,620
You don't eat a good breakfast

1480
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,300
What kind of lychee do you eat?

1481
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,620
I rushed here in a hurry

1482
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,260
I didn't even pay the price

1483
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,460
You know I work all day

1484
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,660
I have hundreds of dollars

1485
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,180
You're so mean

1486
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,540
I'm so angry

1487
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,380
Stop it

1488
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,100
Stop it

1489
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,620
It's embarrassing

1490
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,140
You know it's embarrassing?

1491
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,700
It's the lychee Yang Guifei

1492
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,860
picked for you

1493
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,100
You're so silly

1494
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,860
You can't eat enough

1495
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:51,700
I want to know if it's tomorrow

1496
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,660
or not

1497
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,540
You just don't know

1498
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,860
if it's tomorrow

1499
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,460
Mr. Li

1500
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,900
Although it's not lychee

1501
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,900
you can buy it if you want to eat

1502
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,420
Right?

1503
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,820
Dr. Zhang

1504
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,060
You know

1505
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,420
I'm not talking about lychee

1506
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,260
Where is your son?

1507
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,260
Why didn't your son come?

1508
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,700
He is on a business trip

1509
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,700
He has no time to

1510
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,980
follow you

1511
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,620
On a business trip?

1512
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,820
What a bad son

1513
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,580
He has been here for so many days

1514
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,060
but he doesn't know to come and see me

1515
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,060
When your son was a kid

1516
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,940
you only took care of him for a few days

1517
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,780
You're so mean

1518
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,100
You even beat him

1519
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:38,940
Mr. Li

1520
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,660
I want to emphasize again

1521
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,180
We like lychee

1522
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,180
We can eat it

1523
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:43,940
But we can't eat so much

1524
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,860
in our empty stomach

1525
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,260
Dr. Zhang, don't worry

1526
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,500
I won't eat it later

1527
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,780
OK, stay here with him

1528
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,140
Call me if you need anything

1529
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,860
Why is Mr. Li

1530
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,420
so seriously ill?

1531
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,180
He has been ill for three years

1532
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,460
How could he recover?

1533
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,100
Right?

1534
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,780
If he gets another one

1535
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,220
who can take it?

1536
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,220
Right

1537
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,660
Fortunately, he found it early three years ago

1538
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,820
And the tumor is highly diverse

1539
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,460
He's almost recovered

1540
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,340
So I think

1541
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,380
it's not a big problem

1542
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,620
We also did

1543
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,620
the sample of the rocket

1544
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,220
And the result is out

1545
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:26,940
OK?

1546
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,820
He can't stand it

1547
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,340
He's asking every day

1548
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,420
He's retired

1549
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,700
But he's been

1550
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,340
suspicious of us

1551
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,580
He doesn't tell us

1552
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,900
He thinks we're the suspect

1553
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,780
If it goes on like this

1554
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,420
he'll be scared

1555
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,020
even if he's not ill

1556
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,540
Dr. Zhang

1557
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,260
what should I do?

1558
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,620
Uncle Lin is

1559
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,940
suspicious and suspicious

1560
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,700
You should persuade him

1561
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,180
not to think too much

1562
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,620
Don't scare yourself

1563
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,700
The result is not out yet

1564
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,460
It's not sure what's going on

1565
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:58,860
OK

1566
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,100
I'll go now

1567
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,700
OK

1568
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,220
OK

1569
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,180
Come to me if you need anything

1570
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:04,740
OK

1571
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:07,980
Dr. Zhang

1572
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,460
Have some chocolate

1573
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,940
Thank you

1574
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,500
It's OK

1575
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,460
What did Uncle Lin

1576
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,700
do before?

1577
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,660
Lin

1578
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,820
used to be a security guard

1579
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:20,700
He was very enthusiastic

1580
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,940
Now he's retired

1581
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:22,980
He's willing to help

1582
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,380
whatever he sees

1583
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,180
Dr. Zhang

1584
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,700
Uncle Lin

1585
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:31,740
Are you going to find a doctor?

1586
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,260
I don't have a good appetite

1587
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,220
Dr. Zhang

1588
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,900
I didn't even

1589
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,020
have breakfast today

1590
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,940
I had a nightmare all night

1591
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,540
I dreamed that I was dead

1592
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,340
Your aunt looked at my WeChat

1593
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,300
and Douyin account

1594
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,660
to miss me

1595
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,660
But

1596
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,780
But in the chat record

1597
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:56,900
she found out that

1598
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,780
I had three girlfriends

1599
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,020
and four girlfriends

1600
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,420
She often gave me

1601
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,540
likes and rewards

1602
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,540
Uncle Lin

1603
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,460
You're just thinking

1604
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,260
It's just a dream

1605
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,340
I know it's a dream

1606
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:15,860
But the problem is

1607
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,180
it's a dream in the late night

1608
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,380
A dream in the late night

1609
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,780
It's also a dream

1610
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,380
I've said it on the way

1611
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,780
The dream in the late night

1612
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,380
is the easiest to come true

1613
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:27,900
Dr. Zhang

1614
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,820
I beg you to tell me the truth

1615
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,780
Is my disease recurrent?

1616
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,860
Am I going to die, Dr. Zhang?

1617
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,540
I beg you

1618
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,660
I beg you to tell me the truth

1619
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,420
so that I can be prepared

1620
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,180
If the dream comes true

1621
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,900
I'll delete all the chat records

1622
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:42,860
in advance

1623
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:43,900
Dr. Zhang

1624
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,940
I beg you to tell me the truth

1625
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,780
Dr. Zhang

1626
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,700
I beg you to tell me

1627
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,100
Take care of yourself

1628
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,140
Don't take a shower today

1629
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,420
Okay, thank you

1630
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:52,940
Go

1631
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,260
So many people

1632
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,900
You have no time to eat, right?

1633
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,820
Of course

1634
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,260
You're not good enough with a mouse

1635
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,660
Okay, I'll put it on first

1636
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,180
Come on

1637
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,380
What time are you busy tonight?

1638
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:09,700
Is it hot?

1639
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,300
Remember to eat

1640
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,620
Okay, go back

1641
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,260
Don't take a shower today

1642
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:23,900
Be careful

1643
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:24,380
I'm coming

1644
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,220
I can

1645
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:30,980
Why are you here?

1646
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,660
I'm here to do the autumn anguished

1647
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,500
I heard you can strengthen your body

1648
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,220
Can you?

1649
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,460
Of course

1650
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,580
Wait a moment

1651
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:40,820
Aunt

1652
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,980
You go in with me first

1653
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,260
Take care

1654
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:44,780
Okay

1655
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,460
Hello, this is a table for two

1656
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,100
Let me

1657
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:09,740
Thank you

1658
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,660
Give it to me

1659
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:26,380
Thank you

1660
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:26,940
You're welcome

1661
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,180
Director

1662
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:30,980
We ordered so many dishes

1663
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,300
for just two of us

1664
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,780
If we can't finish it

1665
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:34,740
they won't be here

1666
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,100
We can't waste it

1667
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,140
Jin is working overtime

1668
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,580
Zhang Jun wants to accompany his child

1669
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,420
I have something to do

1670
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:40,740
Eat it

1671
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,820
Let's order some ice cream

1672
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,060
No

1673
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,900
I remember Zhao Dongcheng said

1674
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:51,860
you can't drink

1675
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,020
Have some hot water

1676
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:54,820
I'll pour you some water

1677
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,620
Okay, brothers are in one

1678
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,580
No, I'm just

1679
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,740
What's wrong with you?

1680
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,380
Are you nervous to eat with your boss?

1681
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,260
A little

1682
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,500
Don't take me as your boss today

1683
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,380
Just take me as

1684
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,380
a loving sister

1685
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,500
You're nice

1686
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,220
Why are you not angry?

1687
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,060
You're quite gentle

1688
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,860
You're good at talking

1689
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,820
Give me the spoon

1690
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,180
This is called old ginger meat soup

1691
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:30,020
Drink it more in winter to cool down

1692
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,340
Don't catch a cold

1693
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,660
It will affect your work

1694
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,620
Finish it

1695
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,020
Good

1696
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:09,380
I always feel that the day is a bit long

1697
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,380
Hey, I'm a little flustered

1698
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:17,380
I'm always afraid that the night will become unsteady

1699
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,380
I put on a white shirt

1700
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:25,380
Listen to the heartbeat

1701
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,380
Put love in the blood

1702
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:33,380
Heal the weakest heart

1703
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:38,380
Open a dream kitchen

1704
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:42,380
Walk a difficult journey

1705
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:46,380
Look at the guests and forget

1706
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:50,380
Just for every voice

1707
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:54,380
Open a dream kitchen

1708
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:58,380
Look at the youthful bloom

1709
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:02,380
Ordinary stubborn

1710
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:07,380
The moment to light up the light of life

1711
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:16,380
I put on a white shirt

1712
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:21,380
Listen to the heartbeat

1713
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,380
Put love in the blood

1714
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:29,380
Heal the weakest heart

1715
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:34,380
Open a dream kitchen

1716
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:38,380
Walk a difficult journey

1717
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,380
Look at the guests and forget

1718
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:46,380
Just for every voice

1719
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,380
Open a dream kitchen

1720
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:54,380
Look at the youthful bloom

1721
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:58,380
