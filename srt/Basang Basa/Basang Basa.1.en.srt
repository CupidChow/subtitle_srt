1
00:01:25,844 --> 00:01:27,388
Darlings, how are you doing?

2
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:30,089
Mama, how are you?

3
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:32,474
Darling, I’m sorry,

4
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:35,515
I can’t send money right now.

5
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:37,977
And I can’t come home yet.

6
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:40,596
You take care of Ninay, alright?

7
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:43,505
Ninay, study hard.

8
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:47,171
You know my situation here,

9
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:49,309
I have a new family.

10
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:51,695
Mama, what’s more important to you,

11
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,465
your expenses there,
or your daughters?

12
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:57,160
You always have an excuse.

13
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:59,049
You're also important to me, but...

14
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:00,280
Mama...

15
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:02,943
Mama...

16
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:08,549
I already quit school to work,
and help fund my sister’s schooling.

17
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:11,326
Be patient with me,

18
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:15,793
I have a lot of things
to deal with right now.

19
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:17,437
We heard that many times,

20
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:18,631
we’re expected to understand you,

21
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:20,228
but what have you done?

22
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:24,241
So, you’ll just abandon us here

23
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:25,472
like animals?

24
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:29,271
I’ll send something.
I’ll find a way.

25
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:32,758
I’m just having a
difficult time right now.

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,659
Ma, I hope you understand
that we’re having a hard time too.

27
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:40,234
You shouldn’t just
care about yourself.

28
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:42,494
I’m really sorry.

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,119
Try to be a bit more
understanding, darlings.

30
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:47,360
Tonette...

31
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:51,136
Ninay, try to understand
Mama’s situation right now.

32
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:54,422
Ma, if you really want to,
there’s so many ways.

33
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:57,575
I have to end the call,
the baby’s awake.

34
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,435
Take care, okay?

35
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,501
- Tonette, you take care of Ninay.
- Yes, Ma?

36
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:04,704
Study well, Ninay.

37
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:07,095
I need to go.

38
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:08,829
Bye!

39
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:11,566
Mama?

40
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,047
It’s alright.

41
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:21,511
Hey, stop crying.

42
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:25,994
I’m here for you.

43
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:28,497
I won’t abandon you, alright?

44
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:31,892
Just focus on your studies, okay?

45
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:33,502
Listen to me.

46
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:36,280
I’m here for you, okay?

47
00:03:37,715 --> 00:03:39,550
I love you very much.

48
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:43,346
You have to study well.

49
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:46,098
It's just the two of us.

50
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,602
We don't have parents
we can rely on anymore.

51
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,229
Ninay...

52
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:55,024
Don’t cry anymore.

53
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,868
I’m preparing more food for you.

54
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:00,738
Eat well.

55
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:05,451
Come on, eat.

56
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:15,850
About your tuition fees, pay it.

57
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,549
The rest of the money,
use it for your school projects.

58
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,344
Be serious about your studies.

59
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:27,181
Eat some more.

60
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:33,646
Go on.

61
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:41,983
Ninay...

62
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:45,574
Eat well.

63
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:49,741
Forget what happened.

64
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:55,334
We should accept it.

65
00:04:56,043 --> 00:05:00,339
And it doesn’t mean
that Mama doesn’t love us.

66
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,759
Mama loves us.

67
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:08,139
- But she shares her love with others.
- Love?

68
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:12,743
She has a new family
now, another child…

69
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:17,273
so I hope you understand that.

70
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:24,905
Do you think
it’s that easy for me?

71
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:28,880
It’s so hard.

72
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:33,389
I wish you’d understand what I feel,
not just Mama’s.

73
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:34,707
Ninay...

74
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,334
Ninay, listen to me.

75
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:41,839
All I ask of you is
that you study hard.

76
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:45,009
I’ll help you anyway I can.

77
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:48,239
That’s all I ask of you.

78
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:51,557
I hope you understand me.

79
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,826
- Tonette, do you think—
- Ninay—

80
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:59,054
- You think that’s easy to understand?
- Ninay, listen to me.

81
00:06:03,277 --> 00:06:05,821
I do not want to bear a grudge.

82
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:09,597
Because no matter what we do,
she is still our mother.

83
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,580
I’m here with you, anyway.

84
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:18,577
- Tonette.
- I’m with you. Just listen to me.

85
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:22,713
I will work hard and do all I can for you…

86
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:24,590
…just so you’ll graduate.

87
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:26,534
Thank you, Tonette.

88
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:28,969
I won’t leave you.

89
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:44,044
Go ahead.

90
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:50,509
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Hey, good morning.

91
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:52,578
Hey Ninay, on your way to class?

92
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:53,697
Come on.

93
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:58,767
Hey Jao, let’s have dinner
tonight in our house.

94
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:00,686
I’ll cook adobo.

95
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:02,855
Oh, sure.

96
00:08:03,272 --> 00:08:04,732
How nice of you, ma’am.

97
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:06,233
I’ll wait for you.

98
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:07,972
Alright, ma’am. Be safe!

99
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,282
- Ninay, let’s eat together later, alright?
- Sure.

100
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:21,892
What will we have, is it adobo?

101
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:25,562
Go on, you might
be late for your class.

102
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:26,784
- Okay.
- See you.

103
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:28,315
- Bye.
- Take care, sister!

104
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:30,149
- Tonette!
- Hello.

105
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:33,237
Can we eat together later?

106
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:38,617
Sorry, I will have
dinner with Ninay.

107
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:40,369
I’ll go ahead.

108
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:41,543
Alright.

109
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,333
- I have to go.
- Okay.

110
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:47,936
Good day class,

111
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:51,786
so we’re going to discuss
about the benefits of biodiversity,

112
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:54,575
and these are the
fundamental support or services

113
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:57,511
that a healthy ecosystem provides.

114
00:09:57,928 --> 00:10:00,021
One is the ecosystem services,

115
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:03,824
so regarding fundamental
services of light support,

116
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:09,147
we’re going back to the ecosystem
services that it provides.

117
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:11,156
For example, clean air -

118
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:14,819
how do the plants
provide services like these?

119
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,114
Of course they produce oxygen,

120
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:21,268
absorb carbon dioxide
and filter pollutants...

121
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:11,085
These nutrients are vital
for plants to grow…

122
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:36,095
The bees, butterflies, birds
and other animals, pollinate crops...

123
00:11:44,993 --> 00:11:48,330
Ninay, open the door,
maybe it’s Jao.

124
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,762
Oh!

125
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:04,972
Come in.

126
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:13,503
I'll bring this one..

127
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:19,903
That’s a lot of food.

128
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:21,947
Come, let’s eat.

129
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:27,286
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

130
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:28,954
Don’t be shy, seat’s free.

131
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,749
Just eat, Jao.

132
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:36,361
Thank you.

133
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:37,587
Here, Ninay.

134
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:39,590
Thank you, Tonette.

135
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,259
It's delicious.

136
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:46,637
Thanks.

137
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:53,604
Looks delicious, what dish is that?

138
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:56,356
Adobo? My favorite!

139
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,710
My sister cooks a mean adobo,

140
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:01,278
that’s my favorite too.

141
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:05,949
- Sorry.
- Dig in.

142
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:11,830
- Here, Ninay.
- Thank you.

143
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,376
- So, how have you been?
- I’m okay.

144
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:19,171
How about you guys?

145
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,964
We’re okay.

146
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:24,551
How’s your work?

147
00:13:27,054 --> 00:13:29,431
It’s alright, the people here are nice.

148
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:31,016
Like you two.

149
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:36,709
It’s just the two of you living here?

150
00:13:37,105 --> 00:13:40,316
Yes, just me and Ninay,

151
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:42,725
because Mama is living abroad.

152
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:45,839
She has another family now,

153
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:50,869
so I’m left to care for Ninay.

154
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:53,121
- Sorry.
- It’s okay.

155
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:05,471
You have a good security agency?

156
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:09,801
Yes, my agency’s okay,
that’s why I’ve stuck with them.

157
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:13,475
Before I got assigned
to this village,

158
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:16,103
I worked at San Mateo Village.

159
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:17,896
I worked there for five years.

160
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:21,108
Lucky I got transferred here.

161
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:24,486
The residents there were awful.

162
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:29,366
It’s a good thing
you thought of transferring here, Jao.

163
00:14:29,658 --> 00:14:32,244
Yes, I’m glad I did.

164
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:42,044
Are you full, Jao?

165
00:14:42,045 --> 00:14:43,588
Yes, I ate a lot.

166
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:45,965
- Good.
- Thanks!

167
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:47,509
It’s nothing.

168
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,054
Drink water.

169
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:52,638
I’m good.

170
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,434
I need to get going,
it’s getting late already.

171
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:57,936
Is that so? Alright then.

172
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:00,831
- Alright.
- Alright. Thanks again.

173
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:02,440
Sure, welcome.

174
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:04,483
Tonette, I’ll walk with him
to the gate.

175
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:06,277
Alright, you take care.

176
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:07,887
Tonette, thank you.

177
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,501
Tonette might catch us!

178
00:16:31,571 --> 00:16:32,739
Ninay?

179
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:38,370
Ninay?

180
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,861
Yes?

181
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:13,196
Hey, Jao!

182
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:16,283
What time does your shift end?

183
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:19,038
At six, why?

184
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:20,886
Do you want to
come with me later?

185
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:24,791
I’ll buy something at the mall,
would you be free to come with me?

186
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,196
I can’t,

187
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,963
my brother and I have plans already.

188
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,590
- Oh, really?
- Yes, ma’am.

189
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:34,033
Alright, maybe next time.

190
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:35,677
- I'm sorry.
- We’ll go ahead.

[classroom chatter]

192
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:36,529
[Hi Jao, we don't have classes.]

193
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:44,120
[My sister is not around. Let's meet.]

194
00:18:44,243 --> 00:18:49,896
[classroom chatter]

195
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:54,589
- I need to go now.
- Sure. Take care.

196
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,932
[classroom chatter]

197
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:59,000
They announced that
the professor will be absent!

198
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:00,161
It’s confirmed?

199
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,314
[classroom chatter]

200
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,850
[students cheering]

201
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:13,211
[classroom chatter]

202
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,044
Tonette, I’ll accompany you
home later, okay?

203
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:18,488
Your girlfriend might see me.

204
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:21,449
She’s not my girlfriend.

205
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:23,451
You flirt!

206
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:26,179
Tonette!

207
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:28,414
- Ninay, you're early!
- I’ll go home now,

208
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,316
the professor’s absent.

209
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,810
Really?

210
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:33,419
There’s food in the fridge,
make sure you eat.

211
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:36,655
- Alright. Thank you.
- Okay, take care now.

212
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:39,967
Come on.

213
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:41,958
You’re so persistent!

214
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:46,529
You don’t have plans
for later anyway, right?

215
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:48,517
Stop it.

216
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:52,147
Come on.

217
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:56,985
You’re so naughty.

218
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,741
- I need to go now.
- Sure.

219
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:27,492
Thank you.

220
00:21:29,494 --> 00:21:30,870
Did you enjoy?

221
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:32,497
Of course I did.

222
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:36,084
I want you to always be happy.

223
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:38,001
It goes without saying.

224
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:39,546
I love you, Ninay.

225
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:44,426
You're the one that makes me happy.

226
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:46,970
Really?

227
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:33,237
Ninay?

228
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:35,031
Ninay?

229
00:25:43,247 --> 00:25:44,290
Ninay?

230
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:49,086
Ninay, I brought
something for you!

231
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:51,655
- Come see!
- It's a lot!

232
00:25:51,912 --> 00:25:53,789
You bought so many things.

233
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:56,726
What's this?

234
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,596
This is for you.

235
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,307
I bought that for you.

236
00:26:02,332 --> 00:26:03,932
- Make sure you eat.
- Thank you!

237
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,537
- There’s more.
- Wow, I'm so hungry!

238
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:07,563
Let's eat.

239
00:26:08,189 --> 00:26:09,857
Have you eaten already?

240
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:12,651
Not yet. Good timing.

241
00:26:12,652 --> 00:26:14,486
I bought a lot of things for you.

242
00:26:14,487 --> 00:26:20,743
- Here, look. I got some groceries too.
- Thank you!

243
00:26:37,343 --> 00:26:38,428
Jao!

244
00:26:38,845 --> 00:26:39,845
Come here!

245
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:41,389
For a while, brother.

246
00:26:42,056 --> 00:26:43,400
Yes, ma’am?

247
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:46,894
Um... I cooked.

248
00:26:47,645 --> 00:26:49,939
Maybe you want to have lunch here?

249
00:26:50,356 --> 00:26:52,775
- Ma'am?
- I’ll take care of you.

250
00:26:53,735 --> 00:26:55,486
I’m not allowed leave my post.

251
00:26:56,338 --> 00:26:57,547
They might reprimand me.

252
00:26:57,572 --> 00:26:59,639
I cooked this,
call Fred too.

253
00:26:59,741 --> 00:27:00,908
Give this to him.

254
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:03,911
Fred! Ma’am is calling you.

255
00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:06,456
Fred, this is for you.

256
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:10,209
- Have a taste, I made that.
- Thank you.

257
00:27:11,553 --> 00:27:12,604
That’s a lot.

258
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:16,799
It would be nice
if Jao can eat lunch here.

259
00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:18,593
Is that alright with you?

260
00:27:19,093 --> 00:27:21,554
Okay, ma’am,
I’ll just inform the others.

261
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:23,055
Okay.

262
00:27:23,473 --> 00:27:24,931
Bro, you take over my post.

263
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:26,500
I’ll wait for you, Jao!

264
00:27:36,194 --> 00:27:37,487
Come inside!

265
00:28:00,802 --> 00:28:03,429
The chicken soup smells great.

266
00:28:04,931 --> 00:28:06,224
You like this?

267
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:09,352
- I’ll serve you.
- Let me do it.

268
00:28:09,377 --> 00:28:10,377
Okay.

269
00:28:10,978 --> 00:28:14,273
I’ll just squeeze some lime.

270
00:28:19,946 --> 00:28:21,695
This is my mother’s favorite.

271
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:23,693
Mhm!

272
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:27,453
Where’s your mother now?

273
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:30,331
My mother?

274
00:28:30,873 --> 00:28:31,873
Here, Ninay.

275
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,460
She remarried.

276
00:28:35,044 --> 00:28:36,044
What?

277
00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:38,606
That’s life.

278
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:43,719
That’s why it’s always
just the two of you in this house.

279
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,763
Here, Ninay.

280
00:28:46,055 --> 00:28:47,306
Dig in.

281
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,433
Thanks.

282
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:51,352
Eat a lot.

283
00:28:52,478 --> 00:28:53,813
You too, Ninay!

284
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:56,315
Let me taste this.

285
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:02,362
Is it good?

286
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:04,598
Your cooking is really delicious.

287
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:08,643
This is my favorite
among all the dishes she’s cooked?

288
00:29:11,455 --> 00:29:14,542
You guys really look like
you’re close to each other.

289
00:29:18,504 --> 00:29:22,258
Well, we’ve been left on our own here.

290
00:29:24,677 --> 00:29:27,013
Anyway, where do you live now, Jao?

291
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:29,724
I stay in Novaliches.

292
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:33,462
It’s stressful going back home,
the traffic’s always heavy.

293
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:36,355
It’s been raining,
so it’ll be harder for you?

294
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:39,567
Yes, especially when I commute.

295
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:43,738
I don’t often use my motorbike,
gas is expensive now.

296
00:29:49,577 --> 00:29:51,662
It won’t stop raining anytime soon.

297
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:55,791
You want to stay here for a while?

298
00:29:56,209 --> 00:29:58,336
It’s convenient.

299
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:05,801
- Don’t be shy, eat!
- Yes, I will.

300
00:30:06,677 --> 00:30:09,554
Ninay, eat some more.

301
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:10,580
Yes, I will.

302
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:14,268
Delicious.

303
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:22,944
Yes, it’s delicious.

304
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:30,326
You have plans later?

305
00:30:32,161 --> 00:30:36,916
I’ll go to the mall,
maybe you can accompany me.

306
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,997
I'm sorry...

307
00:30:40,086 --> 00:30:45,341
My shift buddy isn’t here yet,
so my shift will be extended.

308
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:47,009
Is that so?

309
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:51,097
I’m really sorry.

310
00:30:51,514 --> 00:30:52,556
It’s fine.

311
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:56,185
You’ve eaten a lot, Ninay,
you already finished your plate?

312
00:30:57,979 --> 00:31:00,203
That’s how awesome sister’s cooking is.

313
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:02,825
Look at you,
you already had two servings of rice!

314
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,569
She gave it to me,
I didn’t beg for it.

315
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:30,402
Is it delicious?

316
00:31:31,178 --> 00:31:32,346
Yes!

317
00:31:40,747 --> 00:31:42,873
And also the climate regulations.

318
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:46,860
The forests and oceans
acts as carbon sinks.

319
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:54,451
They absorb avast amount
of carbon dioxide.

320
00:31:54,452 --> 00:31:58,330
It helps stabilize our global pattern.

321
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:04,837
Another pollinations of course,
the bees and the butterflies, birds...

322
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:20,185
Hi, Tonette.

323
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,795
Hello, sir, good morning.

324
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:22,994
Yeah, uh...

325
00:32:23,093 --> 00:32:25,721
Maybe you’d like to become
a full-time student assistant?

326
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:27,516
I can recommend you.

327
00:32:28,243 --> 00:32:29,243
Uh...

328
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:32,114
I appreciate your offer, sir,

329
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:35,493
but my priority is
for my sister to graduate.

330
00:32:36,243 --> 00:32:37,369
Sorry.

331
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,601
Well, it’s okay.

332
00:32:38,704 --> 00:32:40,080
But if you change your mind,

333
00:32:40,081 --> 00:32:41,581
our office is right there,

334
00:32:41,582 --> 00:32:44,292
We can help you become
a student assistant. Okay?

335
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:46,628
- Yes, sir.
- Okay?

336
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:47,671
Good day!

337
00:33:30,214 --> 00:33:31,924
What are you doing here?

338
00:33:33,134 --> 00:33:35,594
Tonette might catch us.

339
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,304
Ninay, don’t be like that.

340
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:39,974
Stop it.

341
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:42,059
It’s our chance while she’s away.

342
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:44,645
She'll be here soon.

343
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:46,439
Just relax, okay?

344
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:49,190
I missed you.

345
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:52,051
Jao, my sister might scold me.

346
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:54,446
Please?

347
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:57,408
Time is running.

348
00:33:58,075 --> 00:33:59,702
Ninay, please.

349
00:37:48,263 --> 00:37:50,181
What the hell?

350
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:51,216
Jao?

351
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:53,352
Sister…

352
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:56,730
Don't call me 'sister'!

353
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,776
How long has this been going on?

354
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:02,318
Huh?

355
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:04,321
It’s not what you think.

356
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:05,964
What do you mean
'it’s not what I think'?

357
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:08,242
- Tonette, we can explain.
- Explain what?

358
00:38:08,243 --> 00:38:09,951
That you’ve turned
this house into a motel?

359
00:38:09,976 --> 00:38:13,396
- Sister, we can explain.
- Huh? Don’t call me ‘sister’!

360
00:38:13,915 --> 00:38:15,474
You’ve been flirting with him?

361
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:18,505
- I’ll explain, Tonette!
- Huh? Don’t say my name!

362
00:38:19,128 --> 00:38:20,128
Calm down!

363
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:21,340
What do you mean 'calm down'?

364
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,346
With what you've been doing
do you think I'll calm down?

365
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:27,069
- Please listen!
- What? Don’t you touch me!

366
00:38:27,094 --> 00:38:29,554
And never call me ‘sister’ again!

367
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,251
I’m the one to blame.

368
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:35,144
I quit school to work
so you can study.

369
00:38:35,511 --> 00:38:36,538
This is how you repay me?

370
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:38,856
We just fell in love!

371
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:40,617
- What?
- I'm sorry!

372
00:38:40,664 --> 00:38:43,485
I am not your sister anymore!

373
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:48,852
- Tonette...
- What does this mean?

374
00:38:48,938 --> 00:38:52,067
I'm the one to blame, please.

375
00:38:53,662 --> 00:38:54,872
Jao?

376
00:38:55,873 --> 00:38:57,166
Ninay...

377
00:38:57,892 --> 00:38:59,727
- Get out!
- I'm so sorry!

378
00:38:59,752 --> 00:39:02,671
Stop calling me that!

379
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:07,646
From now on, you will
forget that you have a family.

380
00:39:07,777 --> 00:39:10,279
And never call me ‘sister’ again!

381
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:13,724
- Ninay, get out of this house!
- That's enough!

382
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:15,516
Get out!

383
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:17,811
Get out!

384
00:39:18,979 --> 00:39:22,274
Get out of here,
get out of my house.

385
00:39:25,394 --> 00:39:26,394
Ninay!

386
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:28,031
I really want to hurt you,

387
00:39:28,113 --> 00:39:29,406
but I can't.

388
00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:37,456
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have a sister.

389
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:43,295
- Get out!
- Ninay? Ninay!

390
00:42:20,911 --> 00:42:25,735
Even now, I can’t believe you two
were capable of doing that.

391
00:42:30,379 --> 00:42:31,543
I’m sorry.

392
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:34,640
I got carried away.

393
00:42:35,384 --> 00:42:36,577
We both did.

394
00:42:39,846 --> 00:42:40,912
Sorry.

395
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:40,397
I made you something.

396
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:00,779
Go grab your things.

397
00:48:02,185 --> 00:48:03,962
Stay with me.

398
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:07,593
So I can serve you.

399
00:48:11,344 --> 00:48:14,562
You can save money.

400
00:48:16,182 --> 00:48:17,691
Stay with me.

401
00:48:22,397 --> 00:48:23,690
Are you okay?

402
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:25,376
Yes.

403
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:49,301
Keep eating.

404
00:48:55,513 --> 00:48:57,738
At least you're here with me.

405
00:49:08,526 --> 00:49:09,554
Here’s water.

406
00:49:10,592 --> 00:49:12,416
Thanks.

407
00:49:45,403 --> 00:49:46,463
Jao?

408
00:49:50,151 --> 00:49:53,154
- How are you?
- I’m okay.

409
00:49:55,949 --> 00:49:58,368
I think I’ll drop out from school,

410
00:49:59,577 --> 00:50:01,830
I can’t pay for my studies.

411
00:50:02,205 --> 00:50:03,205
What?

412
00:50:04,462 --> 00:50:05,690
That’s a waste.

413
00:50:09,087 --> 00:50:10,880
I’ll just look for a job.

414
00:50:12,715 --> 00:50:13,995
What kind of work?

415
00:50:15,395 --> 00:50:16,468
I don’t know yet.

416
00:50:19,556 --> 00:50:20,617
Ninay,

417
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,608
I want to help you…

418
00:50:25,186 --> 00:50:30,275
but I can’t even help myself.

419
00:50:31,484 --> 00:50:33,127
I understand you.

420
00:50:35,155 --> 00:50:36,228
It’s okay.

421
00:50:39,993 --> 00:50:41,542
You can try talking to your sister.

422
00:50:43,621 --> 00:50:45,145
Jao, I can’t.

423
00:50:45,498 --> 00:50:47,125
That will just make things worse.

424
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,021
She’ll understand and
she’ll understand us.

425
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:54,368
We are the only
ones left in the house.

426
00:50:58,052 --> 00:50:59,052
Don't worry.

427
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:01,639
She will still accept you.

428
00:51:03,683 --> 00:51:04,683
Us?

429
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:08,521
We have to be honest with her.

430
00:51:13,276 --> 00:51:14,805
I'll tell her.

431
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:16,805
No.

432
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:18,985
I'll take care for this.

433
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,164
So we’re going to continue
our discussions

434
00:51:27,165 --> 00:51:31,643
and these have something to do
with culture and economic values.

435
00:51:31,774 --> 00:51:33,163
So, what does it mean?

436
00:51:33,213 --> 00:51:37,925
Biodiversity directly
supports our way of life

437
00:51:37,926 --> 00:51:39,927
and our economy.

438
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:42,096
Tourism is one.

439
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:45,517
So, it has something to do
with the beautiful beaches...

440
01:01:31,894 --> 01:01:33,229
Hey, Jao!

441
01:01:33,562 --> 01:01:34,673
What brings you here?

442
01:01:36,315 --> 01:01:37,339
Come in.

443
01:01:43,072 --> 01:01:44,826
Have a seat.

444
01:01:45,412 --> 01:01:47,112
- Um, no, it's okay.
- Come on.

445
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,080
Tonette. Let’s talk.

446
01:01:53,082 --> 01:01:54,444
What happened?

447
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,335
Is there any problem?

448
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:58,028
See...

449
01:01:59,922 --> 01:02:01,442
I don’t want to lie to you anymore.

450
01:02:01,715 --> 01:02:02,796
Why?

451
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:07,123
Ninay and I have been having
an affair for a long time,

452
01:02:08,722 --> 01:02:10,474
she just didn’t want to tell you.

453
01:02:10,808 --> 01:02:12,228
Because she’s afraid of you.

454
01:02:13,185 --> 01:02:14,603
She’s afraid to disappoint you.

455
01:02:18,757 --> 01:02:20,385
I don’t want to keep deceiving you.

456
01:02:21,402 --> 01:02:22,492
Even Ninay,

457
01:02:23,904 --> 01:02:25,356
especially for myself.

458
01:02:28,033 --> 01:02:29,929
Am I hearing you right?

459
01:02:31,078 --> 01:02:32,819
Are you serious?

460
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:38,218
Why didn't you tell me from the start?

461
01:02:40,546 --> 01:02:41,997
I lost control.

462
01:02:42,131 --> 01:02:43,966
It all happened so fast.

463
01:02:44,175 --> 01:02:45,289
You lost control?

464
01:02:47,094 --> 01:02:50,181
I don’t want to pretend anymore.

465
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:53,108
Why didn’t you tell me sooner, Jao?

466
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:58,645
What do you think of me?

467
01:02:59,801 --> 01:03:00,801
Huh?

468
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:02,780
You think I can act like
that’s nothing to me?

469
01:03:03,558 --> 01:03:04,928
And with my own sister, too?

470
01:03:05,487 --> 01:03:07,144
Tonette, I didn’t mean
that it was nothing.

471
01:03:07,277 --> 01:03:09,057
- That's why I'm trying to tell you...
- What then?

472
01:03:09,325 --> 01:03:12,121
You should’ve been
honest before this, Jao!

473
01:03:13,913 --> 01:03:15,413
That’s why I told you,

474
01:03:15,748 --> 01:03:18,804
because I don’t want
this to go on longer.

475
01:03:22,379 --> 01:03:23,531
Jao...

476
01:03:26,508 --> 01:03:28,616
Jao, I thought you were being true.

477
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:34,770
Or...

478
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:40,522
You should’ve told me, at least.

479
01:03:41,148 --> 01:03:42,233
Right?

480
01:03:46,153 --> 01:03:47,238
Tonette...

481
01:04:00,554 --> 01:04:01,891
- Mama?
- Tonette.

482
01:04:02,586 --> 01:04:04,880
- Mama?
- Love, I am coming home.

483
01:04:05,798 --> 01:04:08,133
We are alright here.

484
01:04:08,558 --> 01:04:12,178
- And...
- Mohammad is such a womanizer.

485
01:04:12,203 --> 01:04:14,131
Is that so?

486
01:04:14,723 --> 01:04:18,143
Whatever problem you have
with your own family,

487
01:04:18,448 --> 01:04:19,740
try to fix it.

488
01:04:19,765 --> 01:04:21,683
I am coming home.

489
01:04:21,727 --> 01:04:23,519
We’re okay here.

490
01:04:23,607 --> 01:04:25,876
Don't you want to see me?

491
01:04:26,527 --> 01:04:28,988
I want to be with you two again.

492
01:04:32,032 --> 01:04:34,200
Wait for me, okay?

493
01:04:34,225 --> 01:04:37,645
- Don't you want to be with me?
- We’re doing fine here now, Ma.

494
01:04:39,123 --> 01:04:41,118
We don’t need you anymore.

495
01:04:44,186 --> 01:04:45,900
I hope you understand that.

496
01:04:46,975 --> 01:04:48,146
Alright, Mama.

497
01:04:49,962 --> 01:04:52,047
Please always take care of yourself.

498
01:04:52,511 --> 01:04:55,389
Goodbye, Mama.

499
01:04:56,098 --> 01:04:57,932
Wait for me.

500
01:04:57,957 --> 01:04:59,880
Good bye, Mama.

501
01:05:25,544 --> 01:05:27,037
- Tonette...
- Why?

502
01:05:28,589 --> 01:05:30,174
I know where Ninay is.

503
01:05:32,312 --> 01:05:33,526
And so?

504
01:05:35,115 --> 01:05:36,899
Fix your problem.

505
01:05:38,182 --> 01:05:40,131
You two are the ones
who are suffering.

506
01:05:44,631 --> 01:05:45,960
I will be the one to leave.

507
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:49,842
It’s all my fault, anyway.

508
01:07:03,684 --> 01:07:05,730
Ninay, let’s go home.

509
01:07:07,272 --> 01:07:09,300
- Come home.
- Tonette, I'm sorry.

510
01:07:10,274 --> 01:07:11,775
Come with me now.

511
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,486
Alright? Let’s go.

512
01:07:15,529 --> 01:07:16,947
Forgive me.

513
01:07:17,489 --> 01:07:20,551
No, Tonette, I should be
the one to apologize to you.

514
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:22,828
I'm sorry.

515
01:07:22,853 --> 01:07:23,978
It's okay.

516
01:07:24,034 --> 01:07:25,329
Don’t think of it anymore.

517
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:28,392
I love you, okay?

518
01:07:28,417 --> 01:07:30,334
What I did was unforgivable.

519
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:31,377
Ninay...

520
01:07:31,402 --> 01:07:33,070
I’m sorry for everything, too.

521
01:07:34,006 --> 01:07:35,798
Forgive me for what I’ve done.

522
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:37,551
I was selfish.

523
01:07:38,427 --> 01:07:39,844
Forgive me for everything,

524
01:07:39,845 --> 01:07:42,054
I didn't mean it.

525
01:07:42,055 --> 01:07:45,516
- I am the one who feels ashamed.
- I am the one.

526
01:07:45,517 --> 01:07:48,187
I can’t lose you, Ninay.

527
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:50,522
Let’s forgive and
forget everything, okay?

528
01:07:50,939 --> 01:07:55,777
Let’s go home. Come.

529
01:07:57,821 --> 01:07:59,323
Thank you.
