1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
joking

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,820
The second year Class 2 with the strong

3
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:45,980
runs and a delicious electricity from

4
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,840
Beo 영상

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:01:18,100
Oh, thank you for the

6
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,320
I'm here.

7
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,380
Yes.

8
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,440
Thank you.

9
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,640
He's Oh Dong-hyun.

10
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,760
He eats all day and eats in his dreams.

11
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,600
Thank you for the food.

12
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,560
He's Byung-ju.

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,340
He's the one who sleeps all day, so he dreams the most.

14
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,960
Life follows its name.

15
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
What did you dream about yesterday?

16
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
You're wearing a red shirt.

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
Don't pull it too much.

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Don't pull it too much.

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,960
He was a kid who thought Nike and school uniforms were a set.

20
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Why are you wearing a black coat?

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Red is the best.

22
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,960
Hey, the red is not coming to Korea.

23
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,960
Hey, is he a foreigner?

24
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Why?

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
He looks like a jerk.

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Is it your first time seeing a red shirt?

27
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Yeah, it's my first time.

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Red is the best.

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
How did you get it?

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,960
All four of them dream of first place and transfer to Seoul National University.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
There's a route to the front.

32
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,960
The look is over the top.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
Look at him.

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Look at him.

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Hey, you, let's switch to the front.

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,960
Come on, let's switch.

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Look at him.

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
Dreams, personalities, and personality.

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
What's the common ground between them?

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,960
It's our class.

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
It's our class.

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Stop it!

43
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Stop it!

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,960
All of them like our class president, Seon Ah.

45
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Why do you like her?

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
She's pretty.

47
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,960
But isn't she a bit tacky?

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,960
She's pretty.

49
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Seon Ah, it's a big hit.

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Did you hear that Park Ji Sung is going to Europe next year?

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Park Ji Sung is going to Europe?

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,960
I know.

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,960
But what class is she in?

54
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,960
I'll go look for her and come back.

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
How many classes are there between Hyung Pyo and Park Ji Sung?

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
I don't like her acting like she's good at studying.

57
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
She's pretty.

58
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
I feel a bit different.

59
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Right? She's not good.

60
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Seon Ah is sexy.

61
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,960
I'm going to beat you up.

62
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,960
You're not going to do it, are you?

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,960
Catch him!

64
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Catch him!

65
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Episode 2

66
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Attention!

67
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Attention!

68
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
18.

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Back then, we were most thirsty for human desires.

70
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
The fattening appetite.

71
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,960
Byung Joo's sleepiness.

72
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
The perverted king's sexual desire.

73
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
And my fourth desire.

74
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,960
The lust for attention.

75
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Quiet.

76
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
I can see everything from behind.

77
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Don't do anything else.

78
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
This is your last chance.

79
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Hey!

80
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
You bastard!

81
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Teacher's lust for attention?

82
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,960
All of you who have been working hard, get up.

83
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,960
I told you to get up.

84
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
You're not getting up?

85
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
Byun Tae Hwan.

86
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
What did you hide?

87
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
I didn't hide anything.

88
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
You're hiding something in your hand.

89
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
I didn't hide anything.

90
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Put your hands away and stand straight.

91
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Stand straight.

92
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Stand straight.

93
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
This is straight.

94
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Hey, hey.

95
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
I'm going to get up even if I sleep because of you.

96
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Stand straight.

97
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Huh?

98
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
You're out of your mind because you're a boy.

99
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Can you do that in front of your teacher?

100
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
What?

101
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Oh, yes.

102
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Oh, yes.

103
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,960
See you at your class.

104
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
And Son Ahn.

105
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Why are you doing this?

106
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
You're the class president.

108
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Our class is...

109
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Why can't you stand properly?

110
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Stand straight.

111
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Teacher.

112
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Teacher.

113
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Oh, yes.

114
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
This is Korea.

115
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
It's a light stick.

116
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Go for it.

117
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Gu Jin Ho, you sit in front of Seon Ahn with your cheek.

118
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,960
Seon Ahn, you watch Gu Jin Ho with your cheek.

119
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
You pervert.

120
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Go to the bathroom.

121
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Thank you.

122
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Hey, hey.

123
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Hey, hey.

124
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Hey, hey.

125
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,960
Hey, hey.

126
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Hey, hey.

127
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
Hey, hey.

128
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Hey, hey.

129
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Every day, like the day

130
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
I've been waiting for.

131
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Oh, oh, oh.

132
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Oh, oh, oh.

133
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Ha.

134
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
I'm going to fall again.

135
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
It's much better than last time.

136
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,960
How do you feel?

137
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Do you feel good?

138
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
You don't know what feeling is.

139
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Hey, Doong.

140
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Come on.

141
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
One, two, three, four.

142
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Two ants.

143
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Three ants.

144
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Five in all.

145
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Five.

146
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Oh, oh.

147
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Hey.

148
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Hey.

149
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
You're always practicing.

150
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
You're worse than the fat guy.

151
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
Me?

152
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
You're worse than him?

153
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
You have to work hard to get that feeling.

154
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Gu Jin Ho.

155
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Have you ever tried to work hard?

156
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
I don't do that.

157
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
The moment I try,

158
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,960
I'm afraid of what's going to happen to me.

159
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
People who have a lot of mouth like you

160
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
won't be able to develop for life.

161
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,960
You're a bad guy.

162
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Who are you?

163
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Let's play.

164
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Who plays basketball these days?

165
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Play soccer.

166
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Gu Jin Ho.

167
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Put on some clothes.

168
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Who do you look like?

169
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Huh?

170
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Are you here?

171
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Yes.

172
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
I got an interesting call

173
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:53,680
from the Dongchun

174
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
I hope you don't go to the academy anymore.

175
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
I saved money because I didn't go to the academy.

176
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Eat as much as you want.

177
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
I just want to go back to the academy.

178
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
Oh, leave it.

179
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Now you're studying hard with the class president.

180
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
Oh, my.

181
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
The food.

182
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
Oh, my.

183
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
The food is the best for a countryman.

184
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
The food.

185
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Wow.

186
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
Wow.

187
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
Wow.

188
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
Wow.

189
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
Wow.

190
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Wow.

191
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Wow.

192
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
Wow.

193
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Oh, my.

194
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
Attention.

195
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Salute.

196
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Again.

197
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Hello.

198
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,680
Attention.

199
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Salute.

200
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Hello.

201
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Are you ignoring me because I don't have a college entrance exam?

202
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,680
No.

203
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Then you're ignoring me, right?

204
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,680
I'll take a paper exam in 20 minutes.

205
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Oh.

206
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Take out the paper.

207
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,680
There must be someone who didn't bring it to the textbook, right?

208
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,680
If there is, I will accept it as love for me.

209
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,680
No one can handle Mr. Giga's love.

210
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
Get up.

211
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,680
A sensitive boss in his prime.

212
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,680
And if you take that love, you can take the exam.

213
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
Nice to meet you.

214
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Yes.

215
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Should I stand behind you?

216
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,680
You're so pissed off about Rudolph.

217
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
I know you're doing this.

218
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,680
If you work hard, you'll go to a good university and a good company.

219
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
You think you'll succeed, right?

220
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Happiness is not there.

221
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,680
The process of art is the first and foremost element of human life.

222
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Consciousness, consciousness, and the life and existence contained in it.

223
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,680
In order not to become a slave to life, you must have a hobby.

224
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:50,680
Whether it's dreaming, love, or hope.

225
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,680
I smell good.

226
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,680
Good smell.

227
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,680
It's real.

228
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Right?

229
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,680
Gu Jin-woo.

230
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,680
Thank you for earlier.

231
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Today is the day to get off work.

232
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,680
Anyway, thank you.

233
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
But how many leaves?

234
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,680
I brought something if I'm grateful. Why am I empty-handed?

235
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Hey, let's go.

236
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:31,680
Goodbye, friend.

237
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,680
But you really don't have a dream?

238
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,680
You don't study because you don't have a dream?

239
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
No?

240
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Why?

241
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Then why don't you study?

242
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,680
I told you I don't study because I'm afraid.

243
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm afraid I'll be too good at studying if I study hard.

244
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,680
I'm a little afraid.

245
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Why aren't you coming?

246
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Why is he so impatient?

247
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Oh, don't be curious about that.

248
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,680
I'm hurt.

249
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Hey, you're all dead.

250
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,680
Come on.

251
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Now the trend is basketball.

252
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Do you know slam dunk?

253
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:33,700
The left hand is just a

254
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:43,700
Hey, I won.

255
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
Hey, I lost.

256
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
We fought well.

257
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,700
What are you fighting about?

258
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Hey, I won.

259
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Hey, I won.

260
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
Hey, I won.

261
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
Hey, I won.

262
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Hey, I won.

263
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Hey, I won.

264
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,700
Hey, I won.

265
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,700
I won, right?

266
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,700
What is it? Tell me.

267
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Stop bothering Seon-ah.

268
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,700
I'm not kidding.

269
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Tell me before the game starts.

270
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:29,700
Idiot.

271
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Oh, my God.

272
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Oh, my God.

273
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Oh, my God.

274
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Why?

275
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,700
This.

276
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
What is it?

277
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,700
It's a prediction problem for next week's test.

278
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,700
It's a type that teachers like.

279
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Oh, this is the type of paper you were talking about?

280
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,700
What else?

281
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,700
This is a reference.

282
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
I've never asked for this.

283
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
You said you couldn't do it.

284
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,700
I can get half of the test right even if I solve what I gave you.

285
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,700
Why are you so naive?

286
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,700
Because I don't want to ignore it.

287
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Oh, so you've been ignoring me until now because you couldn't study?

288
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
Can I just ignore people if I'm good at studying?

289
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
No, it's not that.

290
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Just keep ignoring me.

291
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,700
I don't care.

292
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,700
I'm not ignoring people who can't study.

293
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,700
What I'm ignoring is the person who's trying.

294
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:51,700
You don't even try that much.

295
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
So this is how it works?

296
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,700
But why is this so hard?

297
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,700
This isn't it.

298
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,700
That's right.

299
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
This isn't mine.

300
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Oh, my God.

301
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,700
Oh, my God.

302
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
Oh, my God.

303
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
The handwriting is pretty.

304
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,700
I didn't even know I read it all the way from that place.

305
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,700
The handwriting is so pretty.

306
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,700
I'm not going to do it.

307
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
No, no, no, no.

308
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,700
Open your hands.

309
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
That's why it's called love.

310
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,700
That's right. Number three is a little tricky.

311
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Did you solve it by writing?

312
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Yeah, look, I'll tell you.

313
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,700
If you apply the writing solution...

314
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
Why do you have to send me a perfect writing?

315
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Move.

316
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,700
I just need to look at one more question.

317
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
I have to study, too.

318
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
Move.

319
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
Move.

320
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,700
You study?

321
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Move.

322
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
Jinho, I'm sorry.

323
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
I'll be back later.

324
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,700
That's right.

325
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Actually, I was studying, too.

326
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Why? Why? Why? Why?

327
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Dad, what's the difference between studying well?

328
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,700
Does life change?

329
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
A lot of things change.

330
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,700
Honey, what's this?

331
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,700
What did you buy?

332
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,700
I'm going to make some bread.

333
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,700
I told you not to buy this.

334
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,700
Let's just eat.

335
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Study.

336
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,700
If you're going to do it, do your best.

337
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,700
What's this?

338
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,700
How much did you buy?

339
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
Come here, guys.

340
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
Don't be so rough.

341
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Study to death.

342
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,700
Come on, hurry up.

343
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Hey, Gu Gyeong-ho.

344
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

345
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
Suna.

346
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Huh?

347
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
This is a big hit these days.

348
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
S.S. Yujin hairband?

349
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
What? Where did you get it?

350
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,700
I sold it out.

351
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
I'll try it.

352
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,700
That's right. S.S. Yujin's full version.

353
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
You're prettier than Yujin.

354
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,700
That's why I'm giving you this.

355
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Oh, thank you.

356
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,700
But how many times did Yujin get it?

357
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
I'll ask Park Jisung.

358
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Really?

360
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,700
You?

361
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Why?

362
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Pretty.

363
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,700
It's so pretty.

364
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Jisoo.

365
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Wait a minute.

366
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,700
One, two, two and a half.

367
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
That's right.

368
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,700
Here, number four and number six.

369
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,700
It's pretty, but the answer is wrong.

370
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,700
What is it?

371
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,700
Try again.

372
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,700
I'm sleepy. I'll be there later.

373
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
I'll give you ten minutes.

374
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
I told you I was tired.

375
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
So?

376
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
I'll solve it in three minutes.

377
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,700
I keep the speed of walking at X, and Suna keeps the speed of walking at Y.

378
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Y, Y.

379
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Why do you do this?

380
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Don't do anything weird.

381
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
It's so noisy.

382
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Don't do it.

383
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
Why?

384
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
It's useless to learn.

385
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
Give up math.

386
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
It's useful.

387
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
I don't give up.

388
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Kim Jisoo.

389
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
58 points.

390
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
Gu Jin-ho.

391
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
86 points.

392
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Look at you.

393
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
You can do it.

394
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,700
Your dream comes true.

395
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Teacher.

396
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
I'm a genius.

397
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
Okay.

398
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
I'll try.

399
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
I'll try.

400
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,700
I'll try.

401
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm a genius.

402
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Okay.

403
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,700
I want to see you for a long time.

404
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,700
I'll go to class A if I do a little more.

405
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
I made three mistakes.

406
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
Classics helps you focus.

407
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,700
Yes.

408
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Answer loudly.

409
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
Yes.

410
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
I'm going.

411
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
Figaro.

412
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,700
Figaro.

413
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,700
You're a genius?

414
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
Well, that's about it.

415
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,700
You're a genius.

416
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,700
Why didn't you do it before?

417
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,700
I don't know the triangle root, but I'm good at it.

418
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,700
When you buy tofu at the market,

419
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
Are you going to say,

420
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
Give me three roots and four?

421
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
Never.

422
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,700
Give me a handful of tofu.

423
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Three roots and four are six?

424
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Why do you study so hard?

425
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Even if it doesn't look necessary,

426
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
I'm just doing it.

427
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,700
Then there's always something to be earned.

428
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
You're like an old man.

429
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
You're childish.

430
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,700
Have you ever been childish?

431
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,700
Do you know how hard it is to be childish?

432
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Yeah, you're always so childish.

433
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,700
Yeah, you're always childish.

434
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
Close your eyes.

435
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Why did something go away so well in those days?

436
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,700
Why did the whole thing reflect on itself every time?

437
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,700
The culprit doesn't even have to raise his hand to confess.

438
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,700
What is it?

439
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
Dream concert?

440
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,700
I told you to study.

441
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,700
These guys.

442
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Look at this.

443
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
Hey, Ddoong.

444
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,700
How many times do I tell you?

445
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
There's nothing in the bag.

446
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Do you only take what you collect?

447
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,700
You know your parents study at school, right?

448
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
Do you know you only charge half?

449
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
What did you buy all this with?

450
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,700
You stole the school fee, right?

451
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,700
What are you going to do?

452
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
I don't know.

453
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
Hey, Ddoong.

454
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,700
Mr. Seo.

455
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,700
How much is the school fee?

456
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,700
How much is it?

457
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
I'll pay.

458
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Ko Jin-ho, are you having a problem with your teacher?

459
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,700
No, that's not it.

460
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,700
I don't think it's right to do that to Dong-hyun because of the school fee.

461
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,700
How can you do this to your teacher?

462
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,700
It doesn't matter if it's school fees or Dong-hyun's belly fat.

463
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
Look at the condition.

464
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
The school is going well, right?

465
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,700
Ko Jin-ho, you're having a good time today.

466
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
Let's go out and lie down.

467
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,700
Teacher.

468
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,700
I think what you did to Dong-hyun is unfair.

469
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,700
Dong-hyun didn't steal the school fee, did he?

470
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
I think he stole it or disappeared.

471
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,700
I think he's looking for it properly.

472
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,700
I'm sorry for the interruption.

473
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,700
I don't remember if I found the school fee that disappeared that day.

474
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
But what I remember is...

475
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
Don't look at me.

476
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,700
I'm embarrassed.

477
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,700
What's embarrassing?

478
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
You're so cool.

479
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
But it's fun to show it with us.

480
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
Honestly, it's fun, right?

481
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
I'm embarrassed.

482
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,700
The hallway we stood on was really hot.

483
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,700
That day's Seon-ah was really pretty.

484
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,700
And as the heat got colder,

485
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,700
I went to the last shopping mall before I became a senior in high school.

486
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
Go straight. Go straight.

487
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,700
Hey, look at the second grade class.

488
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
I'm going to the second grade class.

489
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,700
Go straight. Go straight.

490
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,700
Second grade class, third class, fighting!

491
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,700
You, you, you.

492
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,700
You stole the school fee, didn't you?

493
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,700
If you tell me the truth, I'll tell you Tae-han stole it.

494
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
What?

495
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Byeong-ju, come here.

496
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,700
What Byeong-ju?

497
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
So cute.

498
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,700
What's wrong with you?

499
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,700
Why do you eat so little?

500
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Hey, do you want to eat at the horse-dung?

501
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,700
Let's go right away.

502
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Hey, let's eat horse-dung.

503
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
Oh, what is it?

504
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
Let's eat horse-dung.

505
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,700
Hey, can't you do anything if you're going to eat?

506
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,700
Do it. Do it.

507
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,700
Think about what you ate.

508
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
Jong-hyun, Jong-hyun, I'm coming.

509
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,700
Jong-hyun, Jong-hyun.

510
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,700
Rock, paper, scissors.

511
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,700
I won.

512
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,700
I won.

513
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,700
Rock, paper, scissors.

514
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,700
Oh, my God.

515
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
I'm sorry.

516
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,700
I'm sorry.

517
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,700
I'm sorry.

518
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Hey, rock, paper, scissors.

519
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,700
Do it right or change it with me.

520
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Sorry.

521
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,700
No, no, no, no.

522
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,700
You can't change it until you change the ball.

523
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,700
Hey, I'm going to win no matter what.

524
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,700
I'm going to win no matter what.

525
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Don't worry.

526
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
Byeong-tae, are you bragging?

527
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
Hey, do it right.

528
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Do it right.

529
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,700
Are you okay?

530
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,700
It's no joke.

531
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
I think I'm going to die.

532
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Can't you stand one person?

533
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,700
It's not even a joke.

534
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,700
Hey, it's a joke.

535
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
It's a game. Why are you so serious?

536
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,700
You're a mess, aren't you?

537
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,700
You're a childish bastard.

538
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,700
But what do you want to be in that way?

539
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,700
How do you live?

540
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,700
Let's hear it.

541
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,700
All right.

542
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,700
Hey, Ahn Sung-bin.

543
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,700
Take it.

544
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
Hey, is it fun?

545
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,700
Are you having fun?

546
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,700
What's wrong with you guys?

547
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,700
Hey, stop.

548
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
Stop, stop.

549
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,700
Hey, you guys, get out of the way.

550
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,700
I'm going to hit you.

551
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
I'm going to hit you.

552
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,700
Let go of me.

553
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,700
All right.

554
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
Make a loud noise.

555
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,700
All right.

556
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
You guys, come here.

557
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700
Let's go.

558
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,700
Let's go.

559
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Let's go.

560
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
Let's go.

561
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Stop it.

562
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
Stop it.

563
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Eat yours.

564
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,700
Hey, Seon-ah, are you here?

565
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
Sit here.

566
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
Thank you.

567
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Well...

568
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,700
Dong-hyun.

569
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,700
Yes?

570
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,700
Can you give me a minute after class?

571
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,700
Why?

572
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,700
I have something to ask you.

573
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,700
Of course, of course.

574
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
Are you introducing yourself?

575
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,700
What is it?

576
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,700
You ask me when you study, right?

577
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,700
Oh, no.

578
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,700
Hey, did you two have a fight?

579
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,700
What?

580
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,700
We played a basketball game.

581
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700
You're good.

582
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,700
Why?

583
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
Did you hear about the Soyang Girls' High School?

584
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,700
I heard that the girls are coming out.

585
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,700
Hey, don't do it.

586
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,700
I'm really scared.

587
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,700
Behind you.

588
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
There's nothing.

589
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,700
It rained a lot that day.

590
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
It was a day when the Soyang River was blowing.

591
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:21,700
After the game, the first and second place in the school were still studying.

592
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:29,700
But the red pen on the floor of the first place in the school...

593
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:38,700
I shouldn't have died with that red pen.

594
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,700
The first place in the school was the first place in the school.

595
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,700
What is this?

596
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,700
I'm surprised.

597
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,700
So?

598
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,700
So...

599
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,700
I was walking around the school in the country and waiting for the afternoon to end.

600
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,700
Let's go somewhere else.

601
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,700
Okay, let's go together.

602
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,700
And the next one is our school!

603
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,700
Yes, mom.

604
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,700
Now?

605
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,700
Now?

606
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,700
Yes.

607
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,700
The final exam is coming soon.

608
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,700
So?

609
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,700
There's only two weeks left.

610
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,700
There's a lot left.

611
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,700
I saw you were a genius.

612
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,700
You don't go to the academy, do you?

613
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,700
No, I don't need that kind of thing.

614
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,700
Then...

615
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
Do you want to stay with me and study more from today?

616
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,700
Suddenly?

617
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,700
With you?

618
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,700
Hey, do you like me?

619
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
What are you talking about?

620
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,700
I don't like a guy who's dumber than me.

621
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,700
A genius like me is a dumber?

622
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,700
I've been watching you because you're afraid you'll cry if you lose the first place in the school.

623
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,700
I don't need that kind of consideration.

624
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,700
Okay, do it.

625
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Do it.

626
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,700
Do it.

627
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,700
Do it.

628
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Let's bet.

629
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,700
Bet?

630
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,700
With the score?

631
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Yes.

632
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,700
I won't let you win.

633
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,700
What do you want?

634
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
If I win...

635
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,700
I'll shave your head.

636
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,700
My head?

637
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Aren't you confident?

638
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,700
No, I'm totally confident.

639
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,700
Then...

640
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,700
Let's bet with the score of Gu Kyung-soo.

641
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,700
Okay.

642
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,700
But if I win, you...

643
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,700
You'll be a ghost.

644
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,700
I knew it.

645
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,700
It's because I'm afraid to study alone after school.

646
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,700
You're the apple of my eye.

647
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,700
What's the meaning of apples?

648
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,700
You're the apple of my eye.

649
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,700
You're a precious person to me.

650
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Apple, apple, apple.

651
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,700
Apple of my eye.

652
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Fuck you.

653
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,700
Apple.

654
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,700
Stop it.

655
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,700
Don't say that.

656
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700
Learn only useful things in life.

657
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,700
Alcohol.

658
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,700
Technology.

659
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,700
Hey, technology teacher?

660
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,700
Nice to meet you.

661
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,700
I'll tell you I love you.

662
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,700
How much money did you have?

663
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,700
I had a little money.

664
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,700
Little.

665
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,700
I had a...

666
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
You have a lot of money.

667
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
You have a lot, lot of money.

668
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,700
That's good.

669
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,700
You are the hope.

670
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,700
That's mine.

671
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,700
Go wash your face.

672
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,700
I'll give you ten minutes.

673
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,700
Three minutes.

674
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,700
Go wash your face.

675
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,700
Go wash your face.

676
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Dad.

677
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,700
Go wash your face.

678
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,700
Take it off.

679
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
On your head.

680
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,700
Wait, wait, wait.

681
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,700
No.

682
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,700
What?

683
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
You scared me.

684
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,700
Why?

685
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
Did we look too good together?

686
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
I kept my promise.

687
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,700
What are you doing?

688
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,700
I'm going to school.

689
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,700
I wish you were popular.

690
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
Why don't you choose one of these and go out with someone?

691
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
I have to study.

692
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,700
What do you get if you study like that?

693
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,700
I want to go to a good university.

694
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,700
Is your dream a good university?

695
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,700
Dream?

696
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,700
Yes.

697
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,700
What kind of person do you want to be?

698
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,700
It's raining.

699
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,700
I should have brought some clothes.

700
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
I'm sorry.

701
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,700
I have clothes too.

702
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,700
Don't.

703
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,700
Don't.

704
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,700
I'm taking a break.

705
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,700
Try it on.

706
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,700
I don't mind.

707
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,700
The dark

708
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,700
end of the world

709
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,700
was brightened.

710
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,700
We were

711
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,700
shining

712
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,700
in that time.

713
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,700
Why are you half-baked?

714
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
You look half-baked.

715
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,700
It's getting cold.

716
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:21,700
Why are you

717
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,700
half-baked?

718
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,700
Men are not interested in women.

719
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
Stop it!

720
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:56,700
I won the bet, but why did I untie my hair like a ghost?

721
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,700
I was curious, but I couldn't ask.

722
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,700
I'm home.

723
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,700
You're home.

724
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,700
Wash up, son.

725
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,700
What are you doing?

726
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,700
I'm washing the laundry.

727
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,700
What are you doing?

728
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,700
I'm washing the laundry.

729
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,700
What are you doing?

730
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,700
I'm washing the laundry.

731
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,700
I'm washing the laundry.

732
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,700
Dad, you can't wash this.

733
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,700
Then you just put the smelly thing in there?

734
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,700
Yeah, I'm screwed.

735
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Why?

736
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,700
Did I do something wrong?

737
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,700
I'm sorry.

738
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,700
I'm sorry.

739
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,700
I'm sorry.

740
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,700
I'm sorry.

741
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,700
I'm sorry.

742
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,700
I'm sorry.

743
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,700
I'm sorry.

744
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,700
I'm sorry.

745
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,700
I'm sorry.

746
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,700
I'm sorry.

747
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,700
I'm sorry.

748
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,700
I'm sorry.

749
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,700
I'm sorry.

750
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,700
I'm sorry.

751
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,700
I'm sorry.

752
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,700
I'm sorry.

753
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,700
I'm sorry.

754
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,700
I'm sorry.

755
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,700
I'm sorry.

756
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,700
I'm sorry.

757
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,700
I'm sorry.

758
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,700
I'm sorry.

759
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,700
I'm sorry.

760
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,700
I'm sorry.

761
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,700
I'm sorry.

762
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,700
I'm sorry.

763
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,700
I'm sorry.

764
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,700
I'm sorry.

765
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,700
I'm sorry.

766
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,700
I'm sorry.

767
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,700
I'm so sorry.

768
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,700
I'm sorry.

769
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,700
I'm so sorry.

770
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,700
I'm sorry.

771
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,700
I'm so sorry.

772
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,700
I'm so sorry.

773
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,700
I'm so sorry.

774
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,700
I'm so sorry.

775
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,700
I'm so sorry.

776
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,700
I'm so sorry.

777
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,700
Show hexagon.

778
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,700
Show hexagon.

779
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,700
It's a sailor's slave, and it's not easy to get married.

780
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,700
You're not only married,

781
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,700
It's also a slave!

782
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,700
It was taken from the sink.

783
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,700
I am a slaves.

784
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,700
He's a slave!

785
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,700
He's a slave!

786
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,700
He's a slave!

787
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,700
Shut up!

788
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,700
Hahaha Obviously!

789
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,700
Hahaha Obviously!

790
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,700
You need to get married when her stepfather's swamp rich in wealth couldn't cross English Merchant Episode on multifamily zero?

791
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,700
Hahaha Hopefully!

792
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,860
What is thegren wood?

793
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:57,980
Shoot again!

794
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,020
It's almost gonna go!

795
00:43:59,020 --> 00:43:59,820
Yeah!

796
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,460
Let's goOooo!

797
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,620
16 years old, 3 years of middle school,

798
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,580
and 3 years of high school.

799
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,580
This whole 12 year long period

800
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,580
was measured with only one day.

801
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:34,500
I thought it would be over, but it was strangely empty.

802
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,500
So we started playing like crazy.

803
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:59,700
I was so happy that I didn't even notice it.

804
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:06,700
I was so happy that I didn't even notice it.

805
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:15,700
I was so happy that I didn't even notice it.

806
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:21,700
You fell for me in the heat of a hot Saturday night.

807
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:27,700
Be honest with me.

808
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:33,700
Even if you try to suppress me with your noble eyes,

809
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:39,700
I'm not good at that kind of trick.

810
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:51,700
You fell for me.

811
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:55,700
What are those vague eyes saying?

812
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,700
You fell for me.

813
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,700
Even if you dance, come on, come on.

814
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:09,700
The moment my eyes and your eyes met,

815
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:15,700
I was so happy that I didn't even notice it.

816
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:21,700
Oh, stand by me.

817
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:28,700
If you want, I'll go to the night sky.

818
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:34,700
Oh, stand by me.

819
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:41,700
Even if you dance, come on, come on.

820
00:46:41,700 --> 00:47:06,700
Hey, who told you to come to the beach in winter?

821
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:16,700
I'm sorry.

822
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:23,700
Hey, Jin-ho, Jin-ho.

823
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,700
What's so funny?

824
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,700
What are you doing?

825
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,700
You're more childish than a little kid in the neighborhood.

826
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:39,700
It's so childish.

827
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,700
I really wanted to ask you after the college entrance exam.

828
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,700
Huh?

829
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:55,700
What do you think I'm thinking?

830
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,700
Sun-ah, wait a minute.

831
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:06,700
Jin-ho, you're dead.

832
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:11,700
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

833
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,700
What are we going to be later?

834
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,700
My husband?

835
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:30,700
Well, I can't go to the same college as Sun-ah.

836
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:36,700
I'm going to have to pass the law class after school.

837
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,700
I want to get married soon.

838
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,700
Hey, Donghyun, I'm going to make you my girlfriend.

839
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,700
I'm going to sleep.

840
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,700
I'm going to sleep a lot.

841
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,700
I haven't slept well in a day, so it was really hard.

842
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,700
I'm going to pass the audition and become an idol.

843
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:04,700
And I'm going to work hard for a few years and then marry Jung Woo-sung.

844
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,700
Wow, Yoon Jin-soo is really big and specific.

845
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,700
It's useless. Ask Jung Woo-sung.

846
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,700
Jung Woo-sung also has a position.

847
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,700
What about Seon-ah?

848
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,700
First of all, a good university.

849
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,700
Then I don't know yet.

850
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,700
Seon-ah has a dream too much.

851
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,700
Seon-ah, take Jisoo's dream. She has a lot of dreams.

852
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,700
Hey, hey, aren't you going to ask me?

853
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,700
What are you?

854
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,700
I have to prove it from now on.

855
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,700
What?

856
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,700
I'm a great person.

857
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,700
A strong person.

858
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,700
What is a great person?

859
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,700
A person who can change the world with just a presence.

860
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,700
Don't overdo it.

861
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,700
What great people are we to you after taking the college entrance exam?

862
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,700
Overdo it. Overdo it. Overdo it.

863
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,700
What if you overdo it? The college entrance exam is over.

864
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,700
Hey, yeah, now you're free. Hey, take it. Take it.

865
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,700
But it's a great day. Is it okay?

866
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,700
Hey, your birthday hasn't passed.

867
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,700
Not only me, but Yoon Jisoo and Seon-ah too.

868
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,700
Cool.

869
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,700
What do you think?

870
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,700
The college entrance exam is over.

871
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,700
Yeah, let's drink.

872
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,700
Hey, fast, slow, normal, it doesn't matter. Let's drink.

873
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,700
Yeah, dreams come true.

874
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,700
Dreams come true.

875
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,700
Our Jinwoo?

876
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,700
Of course. He was always smart.

877
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,700
I'll call you when I get the results.

878
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,700
Ta-da.

879
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,700
Wow, awesome.

880
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,700
Son, what if we go to a college on Line 2?

881
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,700
Do we have to look for a house in Seoul?

882
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,700
Are we all going to live in Seoul?

883
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,700
There's a dormitory in the university.

884
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,700
Oh, Siwon.

885
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,700
Hey.

886
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,700
What are you doing here?

887
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,700
Seon-ah.

888
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,700
What's going on?

889
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,700
What should I do?

890
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,700
I think I got a 4th grade answer wrong.

891
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,700
I got 30 points lower than the fake one.

892
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,700
I've never done this before.

893
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:09,700
I made a stupid mistake in the most important exam.

894
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,700
What should I do?

895
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,700
I'm only good at studying.

896
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,700
It's cold. Let's go to a cafe.

897
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:07,700
Seon-ah, you know I like you a lot, right?

898
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,700
What?

899
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,700
I'm going to like you no matter what your exam results are.

900
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,700
You really...

901
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,700
You have to understand the atmosphere.

902
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,700
I'm sorry.

903
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

904
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,700
I'll cancel it.

905
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,700
I'll cancel it.

906
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:04,700
I thought life would be ruined if the college entrance exam failed.

907
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,700
Now that I think about it, it was just one test.

908
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,700
It wasn't anything.

909
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:21,700
The first test was to continue the flight from Soyang River to Huncheon and the airport in Gongsan.

910
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,700
The second test was to continue the flight from Soyang River to Huncheon and the airport in Gongsan.

911
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:32,700
To all the students of Gongchuncheon High School who have continued the flight from Soyang River to Huncheon and the airport in Gongsan,

912
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,700
this test was to continue the flight from Soyang River to Huncheon and the airport in Gongsan.

913
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,700
Sungbin passed the law school in Sinchon.

914
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,700
He applied for a student's school in a safe room, but he's sorry until the end.

915
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,700
Yes, Mr. Choi.

916
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,700
It's Dong-hyun's mom.

917
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,700
Yes, I passed.

918
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,700
Dong-hyun is a Catholic.

919
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,700
It's all thanks to you.

920
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,700
I'm sorry.

921
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,700
I'm going to be born.

922
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,700
The pervert king who went to a place full of stones, wind, and women.

923
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,700
He's in Jeju University.

924
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,700
He was so eager to date, and the sky must have been touching.

925
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,700
It's not Byung-ju, it's Byung-ju.

926
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,700
And I have to graduate now.

927
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,700
Byung-ju, who was always late because he slept a lot, passed late.

928
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,700
120 students in the waiting room missed.

929
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,700
I'm a college student now.

930
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:27,700
Go to college.

931
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,700
Eun Jong-min.

932
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,700
Hey, hey, hey.

933
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,700
Hey, hey, hey.

934
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,700
Go to college.

935
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:36,700
Seon-ah, who was out of her class, passed the law school.

936
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,700
I studied so hard to go to Seoul with Seon-ah,

937
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,700
but I was the only one going to Seoul.

938
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,700
I'm sorry.

939
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,700
I still can't believe I graduated.

940
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,700
Yeah, you're 20 years old.

941
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,700
I should've been a trainee when I was a teenager.

942
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,700
It'll work out. You said you got a second call.

943
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,700
I don't know.

944
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,700
Anyway,

945
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,700
You were the most popular person in school.

946
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,700
How do you feel?

947
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,700
What do you mean?

948
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,700
You're so humble.

949
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,700
You know I'm mean, right?

950
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,700
You're so annoying.

951
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,700
I'm just thankful for everything.

952
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,700
I'm sorry for everything.

953
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,700
I'm sorry.

954
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,700
Who's the most thankful?

955
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,700
Who do you want to confess to?

956
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,700
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

957
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,700
Tell me.

958
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,700
Tell me.

959
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:00,700
You're the only one who needs to know.

960
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,700
Okay, I promise.

961
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,700
Actually...

962
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,700
Guys, graduation...

963
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,700
is over!

964
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,700
I'm sorry.

965
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,700
In a time when I could just dream,

966
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,700
I was heading to a time when I had to achieve my dream.

967
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,700
But I still believed that our possibilities were infinite,

968
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,700
and I thought our dreams would be realized.

969
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,700
So...

970
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,700
So,

971
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,700
I become a teacher when I graduate?

972
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,700
Yeah.

973
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:55,700
That's right.

974
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,700
Is that...

975
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,700
a man who's in a school?

976
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,700
I don't know.

977
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,700
You're going to study even when you go to college, right?

978
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,700
I'm going to date someone.

979
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,700
Wait.

980
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,700
That arm...

981
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,700
Why?

982
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,700
Give it to me.

983
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,700
I'm sorry.

984
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,700
I'm sorry.

985
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,700
I'm sorry.

986
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,700
I'm sorry.

987
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,700
I'm sorry.

988
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,700
I'm sorry.

989
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,700
I'm sorry.

990
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,700
I'm sorry.

991
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,700
I'm sorry.

992
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,700
I'm sorry.

993
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,700
I'm sorry.

994
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,700
I'm sorry.

995
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:51,700
I'm sorry.

996
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,700
I'm sorry.

997
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,700
I'm sorry.

998
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,700
I'm sorry.

999
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,700
I'm sorry.

1000
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,700
I'm sorry.

1001
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,700
I'm sorry.

1002
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,700
I'm sorry.

1003
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,700
I'm sorry.

1004
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,700
I'm sorry.

1005
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,700
I'm sorry.

1006
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,700
I'm sorry.

1007
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,700
I'm sorry.

1008
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:04,700
I'm sorry.

1009
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:05,700
I'm sorry.

1010
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,700
I'm sorry.

1011
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:07,700
I'm sorry.

1012
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:08,700
I'm sorry.

1013
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,700
I wear this every day.

1014
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,700
Why?

1015
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,700
Because...

1016
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,700
When we break up, our wish comes true.

1017
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,700
I've been to the place where the aliens used to live.

1018
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,700
It's all thanks to Suna.

1019
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:15,700
The first thing I learned at college was how many games there were to feed alcohol to the world.

1020
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:23,700
I'm going to drink in the room anyway, and I'm going to go to the M.T.

1021
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,700
Fighting, school uniform!

1022
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,700
Suna, are you okay?

1023
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,700
Yeah, I'm fine.

1024
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,700
Are you disinfecting the school?

1025
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,700
Smell the alcohol.

1026
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,700
You're doing great.

1027
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,700
I'm sorry.

1028
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,700
Suna!

1029
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,700
Suna!

1030
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,700
Suna!

1031
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,700
This one.

1032
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,700
Who is it?

1033
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,700
It's pretty.

1034
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,700
Let me see.

1035
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,700
Okay, okay.

1036
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,700
I won't look.

1037
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,700
What?

1038
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,700
What's this?

1039
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,700
Suna, are you okay?

1040
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,700
Korean!

1041
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:30,700
Korean!

1042
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,700
Korean!

1043
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,700
Korean!

1044
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,700
Korean!

1045
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:34,700
Korean!

1046
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,700
Korean!

1047
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,700
Korean!

1048
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:47,700
Suna and I didn't meet often because we were far away from school, but we somehow found a reason to meet.

1049
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,700
Hello?

1050
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,700
Oh, sorry.

1051
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,700
I was in class.

1052
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,700
Really?

1053
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,700
Suna!

1054
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,700
Suna!

1055
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,700
Oh.

1056
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,700
You ordered a couple set, right?

1057
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,700
Couple set?

1058
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,700
Oh, two-person set.

1059
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,700
How long have you been dating?

1060
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,700
I haven't been dating yet.

1061
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,700
It hasn't been long.

1062
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,700
It's a good time.

1063
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,700
Have a good time.

1064
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,700
Oh, yes.

1065
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,700
Okay.

1066
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,700
Jinwoo.

1067
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:42,700
Actually, I lose my stuff often, I sleep a lot, and I'm not good at cleaning.

1068
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:45,700
I'm good at making stupid mistakes.

1069
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,700
I was pushed to the semifinals.

1070
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:53,700
And I don't know what's trending these days.

1071
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,700
What's that?

1072
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,700
So, what I'm saying is...

1073
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:05,700
I, who you like, could be in your imagination.

1074
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,700
My imagination isn't that rich.

1075
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,700
Think about it.

1076
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:16,700
Do you really like me?

1077
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,700
I like you.

1078
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,700
Why do you say that?

1079
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:27,700
Are you dumped without even confessing?

1080
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:31,700
I should confess properly in the best way.

1081
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,700
I was in a hurry.

1082
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:43,700
I, who was still immature, thought that the strong side was the cool side.

1083
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:53,700
I, who was still immature, thought that the strong side was the cool side.

1084
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,700
What are you doing with the light?

1085
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,700
It's okay.

1086
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,700
It's just a arm for friendship.

1087
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,700
Are you okay?

1088
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,700
It's just a ear for love.

1089
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,700
Go ahead.

1090
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:24,700
I'm going.

1091
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:35,700
Seon-ah.

1092
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,700
Seon-ah.

1093
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,700
Are you hurt? Where?

1094
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:43,700
It's nothing. I got hurt while practicing martial arts with the kids.

1095
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,700
Seon-ah.

1096
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,700
There's a competition next month.

1097
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,700
So, you're going to fight again?

1098
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,700
Martial arts is just sports.

1099
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,700
Why are you doing such a dangerous thing?

1100
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,700
Aren't you studying?

1101
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:59,700
I mean, I'm doing this for my physical strength.

1102
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,700
Martial arts is the strongest sport.

1103
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,700
It's really cool.

1104
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:04,700
Really?

1105
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,700
Can you stop fighting?

1106
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,700
It's okay. I'll hang up.

1107
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,700
Martial arts is just sports.

1108
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,700
I think I can do it with one hand.

1109
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,700
Should I come out?

1110
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,700
Should I use one hand?

1111
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,700
Yes, use one hand.

1112
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:31,700
I invited Seon-ah, but she didn't want to come out.

1113
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,700
I'm going to use my hand.

1114
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,700
I'm going to use my hand.

1115
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:40,700
I invited Seon-ah, but she didn't want to come out.

1116
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,700
It's okay.

1117
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,700
It's okay.

1118
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,700
Seon-ah, how was it?

1119
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,700
Cool, right?

1120
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,700
If I had won, it would have been even cooler.

1121
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,700
You really have to do something so dangerous.

1122
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:46,700
What?

1123
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,700
There's nothing dangerous.

1124
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,700
It's actually relieving stress after a game.

1125
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,700
In the end, it's a fight that ends when one person falls.

1126
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,700
I'm going to do it.

1127
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,700
I'm going to do it.

1128
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,700
I'm going to do it.

1129
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,700
I'm going to do it.

1130
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,700
I'm going to do it.

1131
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,700
In the end, it's a fight that ends when one person falls.

1132
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,700
Don't worry.

1133
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,700
I won't fall.

1134
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,700
You're so childish.

1135
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,700
Please listen to me.

1136
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,700
Don't do that.

1137
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,700
Listen to me one more time.

1138
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,700
If you see me win, you'll think differently.

1139
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,700
No, I'm going.

1140
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,700
Just once.

1141
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,700
Just once, please.

1142
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,700
Why do you always do this to me?

1143
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,700
Let's just go.

1144
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,700
I'm holding it back because of you.

1145
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,700
Goodbye.

1146
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,700
Make sure to keep an eye on the guy.

1147
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,700
Let's go.

1148
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,700
Let's just go.

1149
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,700
What should we do?

1150
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,700
Let's go.

1151
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,700
Please.

1152
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,700
Please.

1153
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,700
Hey, you little rabbit.

1154
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,700
If you're not satisfied with the anchovy, come back here.

1155
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,700
I'll be nice to you guys.

1156
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,700
Did you get surprised?

1157
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,700
But I'm sure it's because it's a fight.

1158
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,700
Maybe it's because there's a match.

1159
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,700
It doesn't hurt much.

1160
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,700
If I had one person by my side, I'd have won 10 million percent.

1161
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,700
Oh, my God.

1162
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,700
Let's go.

1163
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,700
I asked you to do that.

1164
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,700
Let's just go.

1165
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,700
Hey.

1166
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,700
How can they just go when they say that to you?

1167
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,700
Huh? Is it raining?

1168
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:36,700
You could have avoided me at least once.

1169
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,700
I wanted to protect you.

1170
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,700
I wanted to protect you.

1171
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,700
But is that such a big mistake?

1172
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,700
Why are you so angry?

1173
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,700
Didn't you expect this to happen?

1174
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,700
You're all grown up, so you're just going to do something stupid.

1175
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,700
How long are you going to be childish?

1176
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:58,700
I'm childish?

1177
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,700
Yeah, you're childish.

1178
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:06,700
Why do you ignore everything I do?

1179
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:10,700
Is it childish to protect what I value?

1180
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,700
You're an adult. You shouldn't have done something so immature.

1181
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,700
Yeah, I'm immature.

1182
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,700
I didn't have any manners, so I tried to look good.

1183
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:20,700
I was immature and childish, so I fell in love with you alone.

1184
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,700
I was just being childish.

1185
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,700
Then we should stop.

1186
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,700
I told him to stop, but his body was getting away from Seon-ah.

1187
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:52,700
Ko Jin-ho, I don't know anything.

1188
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:58,700
I told him to stop, but he was talking childishly.

1189
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:04,700
Yeah, I'm sorry that a stupid guy like me likes a good guy like you.

1190
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,700
I didn't know at that time.

1191
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:14,700
Women grow up faster than men.

1192
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,700
The man realizes it after a long time.

1193
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,700
Hello?

1194
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,700
What? Did you fight?

1195
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,700
He doesn't even want to regret it?

1196
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,700
It's not the time to do this.

1197
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,700
You should have comforted me.

1198
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:42,700
They abandoned me, who was in sadness, on the way, and ran to Seon-ah.

1199
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,700
But the re-education was the fastest.

1200
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,700
You're a bad guy.

1201
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,700
Are you okay?

1202
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:08,700
Tae-hwan, who came to Gimpo Airport and couldn't meet Seon-ah, came to me, maybe he was just sad to go back to Jeju Island.

1203
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,700
The person you contacted is only me?

1204
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,700
Only me?

1205
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,700
This is not right.

1206
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,700
Tell the betrayers to take off.

1207
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,700
They must be busy.

1208
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,700
They are busy.

1209
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:24,700
But I came here by plane to comfort you.

1210
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,700
You, a friend like me, you...

1211
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,700
Have a drink.

1212
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,700
I should have recognized you then.

1213
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,700
Stop it.

1214
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,700
I love you.

1215
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,700
I love you.

1216
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,700
Seon-ah!

1217
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,700
Tae-hwan!

1218
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,700
Tae-hwan!

1219
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,700
I feel better when I see nature.

1220
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,700
Thank you.

1221
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,700
As expected,

1222
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,700
friends are good.

1223
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,700
Seon-ah,

1224
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,700
Jin-woo and you,

1225
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,700
you guys might get back together.

1226
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,700
But then,

1227
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,700
I thought I would regret it for the rest of my life.

1228
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,700
What are you saying all of a sudden?

1229
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,700
I'm sorry,

1230
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,700
but I couldn't miss this opportunity.

1231
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,700
I'm sorry,

1232
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,700
but I couldn't miss this opportunity.

1233
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,700
I'm sorry.

1234
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,700
So, you did 100% wrong.

1235
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,700
If it was you, I wouldn't have been able to stand it.

1236
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,700
You would have.

1237
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,700
If it was you,

1238
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,700
I would have run away even if you pushed me to fight.

1239
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,700
I'm sorry.

1240
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,700
The past love is inside me.

1241
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,700
I told you not to die.

1242
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,700
I'm sorry.

1243
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,700
It's okay.

1244
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,700
Come on.

1245
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,700
You are the champion knight, Min Kyung-hoon.

1246
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,700
I'll give you confidence in a really good place.

1247
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,700
Ye-bi, you too.

1248
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,700
Okay, my song.

1249
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,700
I'll sing a song and go.

1250
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,700
Don't cry, Byung-hoon.

1251
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,700
I'm sorry.

1252
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,700
Why is it so big?

1253
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,700
What?

1254
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,700
What is this soldier's welfare?

1255
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,700
I don't think it's going to close.

1256
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,700
I'm sorry.

1257
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,700
I'm sorry.

1258
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:58,700
My dad said that everyone has a place to go in times like this.

1259
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,700
Put your heads together!

1260
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,700
Get your heads together!

1261
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,700
Attention!

1262
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,700
Attention!

1263
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,700
Salute!

1264
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,700
Salute!

1265
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,700
This bastard is out of his mind.

1266
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,700
Are you going to wear a soldier's bracelet?

1267
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:26,700
My youthful power is gone.

1268
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:28,700
Seon-ah is gone.

1269
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,700
Salute!

1270
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,700
Salute!

1271
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,700
Salute!

1272
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,700
Salute!

1273
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,700
Salute!

1274
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,700
I'll see you right away.

1275
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,700
Do you have a girlfriend?

1276
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,700
No!

1277
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:00,700
Then, you call out the name of the person you think of the most and run down.

1278
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,700
Salute!

1279
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,700
An Jung-bi, you bastard!

1280
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,700
An Jung-bi, you bastard!

1281
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,700
An Jung-bi, you bastard!

1282
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,700
How about joining the exchange in Seoul?

1283
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,700
I was actually a little disappointed that you failed the college entrance exam.

1284
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,700
I think you want to come to Seoul, too.

1285
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,700
That's true, but it's a little...

1286
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:22,700
I do want you to be famous in Seoul, not in Gangwon-do.

1287
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:28,700
It might not be a problem now, but if you get a lover and get married later,

1288
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:32,700
one of the two might not be able to work.

1289
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:36,700
Sung-bin, what kind of person do you want to be?

1290
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:38,700
I'm a lawyer.

1291
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,700
That's a job, not a job.

1292
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,700
I want to be a lawyer.

1293
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:48,700
That's a job, not a job.

1294
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,700
A dream.

1295
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,700
Isn't a job a dream?

1296
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:58,700
I'm sorry.

1297
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,700
I didn't mean it like that.

1298
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,700
I'm sorry.

1299
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:20,700
The Chippao typhoon butterfly has passed Okinawa and has been causing damage by spraying

1300
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:24,700
200 millimeters of firewood per hour in Gangwon-do.

1301
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:30,700
The typhoon is expected to spread a strong reaction and firewood at a maximum speed of 47.3 meters

1302
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:34,700
and cause a greater damage.

1303
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,700
Hello?

1304
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,700
Hello?

1305
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,700
Hello?

1306
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,700
Hello?

1307
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,700
How many minutes?

1308
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,700
Three minutes.

1309
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,700
Ten minutes.

1310
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,700
Sergeant Gu Jin-woo.

1311
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,700
I have a favor to ask you.

1312
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,700
I heard that the fire in our hometown is also very serious.

1313
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,700
But?

1314
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:06,700
I'm sorry, but I'd like to ask you to give me a call from your hometown.

1315
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,700
Yes.

1316
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,700
Is it your parents?

1317
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,700
What?

1318
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:14,700
Three minutes. No, one minute.

1319
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,700
You're so slow.

1320
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,700
Get down.

1321
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,700
Get down!

1322
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,700
Gu Jin-woo, are you crazy?

1323
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,700
Gu Jin-woo!

1324
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,700
Gu Jin-woo!

1325
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,700
I saw it.

1326
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,700
Sergeant Gu Jin-woo.

1327
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,700
I'll give you three minutes.

1328
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,700
Thank you.

1329
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,700
I'll call you later.

1330
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,700
Yes, please come first.

1331
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,700
Hello?

1332
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,700
Hello? Oh Seon-ah?

1333
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,700
Is Seon-ah here?

1334
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,700
Jin-woo?

1335
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,700
Where are you? Are you okay?

1336
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,700
You're not going to move? You're not hurt?

1337
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,700
I'm going to fall over.

1338
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,700
Speak slowly.

1339
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,700
Are you okay?

1340
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,700
I'm not very okay, but

1341
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,700
my family is all right.

1342
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,700
Anyway, I'm fine.

1343
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:38,700
I'll hang up now.

1344
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,700
Thank you.

1345
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:42,700
For caring.

1346
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,700
This is it.

1347
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,700
If you disappear, my memories will disappear.

1348
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,700
You're good at talking.

1349
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,700
You didn't call me on vacation.

1350
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,700
I was afraid I'd be a hindrance to seeing Sung-bin.

1351
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,700
Hindrance?

1352
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:02,700
What kind of hindrance?

1353
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,700
Didn't you two go out?

1354
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,700
I've never been in a relationship.

1355
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,700
Really?

1356
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,700
Yeah. Who said that?

1357
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,700
Then who else is dating?

1358
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,700
Mind your own business.

1359
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:24,700
I should have been nice to Sung-bin.

1360
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:26,700
He's a good guy.

1361
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,700
I don't know.

1362
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,700
Sung-bin doesn't seem to like me.

1363
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:32,700
What are you talking about?

1364
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,700
He liked you so much.

1365
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,700
The Oh Seon-ah that Sung-bin likes

1366
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:38,700
seems a little different from me.

1367
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,700
It's funny that you're saying this now,

1368
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,700
but the person who liked me as I am

1369
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,700
is the one who's been waiting for me.

1370
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,700
I'm sorry.

1371
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,700
I think you're the only one

1372
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,700
who liked me as I am.

1373
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,700
Jin-woo.

1374
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,700
You know so well.

1375
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,700
Why didn't you accept me?

1376
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,700
I was just

1377
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,700
scared.

1378
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:10,700
People say that.

1379
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,700
After dating,

1380
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,700
the feelings of excitement disappear.

1381
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,700
The beginning of a relationship

1382
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,700
is the end of excitement.

1383
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,700
Maybe I wanted you

1384
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,700
to like me

1385
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,700
for a long time.

1386
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,700
You're so mean.

1387
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:34,700
Wasn't it the same for you?

1388
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:36,700
What about me?

1389
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,700
That day in Namsan.

1390
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,700
Why didn't you give me

1391
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,700
the chance to answer?

1392
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,700
I thought I'd be rejected.

1393
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,700
So

1394
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,700
I was afraid

1395
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,700
I wouldn't be able to do what you like.

1396
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,700
I was scared.

1397
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,700
I was scared.

1398
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,700
Jin-woo.

1399
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:14,700
Thank you

1400
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,700
for liking me.

1401
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,700
Me too.

1402
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,700
I like you.

1403
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:50,700
I like

1404
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:52,700
the time when I liked you.

1405
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,700
You're my sunshine blue.

1406
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,700
Just let me let shine through.

1407
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,700
Every little second.

1408
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:10,700
I feel so close to you.

1409
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,700
Time flew by after I got discharged.

1410
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:22,700
Most of them were busy with

1411
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,700
getting a job, but there were

1412
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,700
people who were dreaming.

1413
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,700
This is really good.

1414
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,700
Should I buy this?

1415
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,700
Byung-joo got a job at a furniture company

1416
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,700
to save his skills.

1417
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,700
I don't know why,

1418
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,700
but he became the salesman of the month.

1419
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:48,700
Tae-hwan, who didn't get a chance

1420
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,700
to play CC in Jeju University,

1421
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,700
lost his dream in the air

1422
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,700
in the year of the rat.

1423
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,700
After hearing from his father

1424
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:02,700
that the world of prosecutors will come,

1425
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:04,700
he chose to become a prosecutor,

1426
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,700
not a lawyer.

1427
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,700
He's so unlucky.

1428
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,700
I'm not a salesman.

1429
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,700
I'm a salesman.

1430
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,700
Cut, cut, cut!

1431
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,700
Dong-hyun jumped into the K-pop industry

1432
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:26,700
and lost his way.

1433
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,700
Jisoo, who was a teacher

1434
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,700
at the rooftop of the school,

1435
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,700
became a choreographer.

1436
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,700
This is the rice.

1437
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,700
It's lemonade, and it's refreshing.

1438
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,700
It doesn't taste like anything.

1439
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,700
It was a girl group's dream,

1440
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,700
but they lost their happiness

1441
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,700
in a place close to the church.

1442
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,700
How is it? This feeling?

1443
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:56,700
I?

1444
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,700
I don't know if I've become a great person,

1445
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,700
but I started a great company.

1446
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,700
Hello. Hello.

1447
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:04,700
People said my webtoon was too childish

1448
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:06,700
and posted bad comments

1449
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,700
to increase the number of views,

1450
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:10,700
so I became a popular writer.

1451
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:22,700
D and D.

1452
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,700
Great.

1453
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,700
I'm a great person.

1454
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,700
I'm a great person.

1455
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,700
I'm a great person.

1456
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,700
What is this?

1457
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:34,700
I don't recommend it.

1458
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,700
I don't recommend it.

1459
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,700
I got a call from the website.

1460
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,700
When will it be uploaded?

1461
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,700
I heard they'll give you a penalty if you're late again.

1462
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,700
Yes, okay.

1463
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:56,700
And I started drawing the next webtoon.

1464
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:00,700
The main character is...

1465
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:08,700
It's not Yang Bo-hyun.

1466
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,700
Hello?

1467
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,700
It's me.

1468
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,700
Who?

1469
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:20,700
Dad.

1470
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,700
You should stop being busy.

1471
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,700
It's been a while since I got a call.

1472
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,700
But why are you so nervous?

1473
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:28,700
What's going on?

1474
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,700
Guess.

1475
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,700
Are you going to confess now?

1476
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:34,700
You're still the same.

1477
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:36,700
Of course.

1478
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:38,700
I'm a great person.

1479
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:40,700
I can accept it if you want.

1480
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,700
Then...

1481
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,700
I'll really

1482
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:46,700
confess.

1483
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,700
We're going to hold a ceremony in a while.

1484
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,700
The guests will be...

1485
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,700
Jisoo.

1486
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,700
I need a bed.

1487
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:02,700
I'll make it cheap.

1488
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:04,700
Come to Jeju Island.

1489
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:06,700
When will the food be ready?

1490
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,700
It's really good.

1491
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,700
Let's send it like this.

1492
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,700
I'm going to send it when my husband passes by.

1493
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,700
Are you an elementary school kid?

1494
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,700
You're not going to bless me.

1495
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,700
I'm happy because I like you.

1496
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,700
I hope you're happy with another man.

1497
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,700
There's no such man in the world.

1498
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:24,700
There's no such man.

1499
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,700
Now, the most beautiful bride will come in.

1500
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,700
Please give her a warm applause.

1501
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,700
Today's main character is better than anyone else.

1502
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,700
Bride entrance.

1503
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,700
The bride is here.

1504
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,700
She's here.

1505
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:58,700
She's here.

1506
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:00,700
She's here.

1507
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:02,700
She's here.

1508
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,700
She's here.

1509
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:06,700
She's here.

1510
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,700
She's here.

1511
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,700
She's here.

1512
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,700
She's here.

1513
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,700
She's here.

1514
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,700
She's here.

1515
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:18,700
She's here.

1516
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:20,700
She's here.

1517
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:22,700
She's here.

1518
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:26,700
She's here.

1519
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,700
She's here.

1520
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:36,700
If Sungbin is wrong.

1521
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:38,700
If a man truly loves a woman,

1522
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,700
When she has a lover,

1523
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,700
I sincerely wish you a long and happy life.

1524
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,700
Congratulations!

1525
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:57,580
Yes, that's good.

1526
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:59,580
Now, the groom's bride kiss.

1527
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,580
Applause for the bride!

1528
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:03,580
Yes, kiss!

1529
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,740
The men in the back, aren't you the police?

1530
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:09,740
Your faces are so scary. Smile!

1531
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:13,420
Yes, thank you.

1532
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,220
Congratulations!

1533
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:18,220
Let's take a picture together.

1534
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:21,100
Sir, can we take one more picture?

1535
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,100
We're friends.

1536
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:25,100
No, we're not.

1537
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,100
Okay.

1538
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,100
One, two!

1539
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,100
Okay, done!

1540
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:35,100
Congratulations!

1541
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,100
Thank you.

1542
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:43,180
Sir, how do you feel about marrying the most beautiful woman in the country?

1543
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:45,180
It's like a dream.

1544
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:47,180
I'll always live with a sincere heart.

1545
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:50,140
Yes, that's why.

1546
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:52,140
I'm so sorry to send you off like this.

1547
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,140
Lastly, I'll give this bride a kiss.

1548
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:58,140
Hey!

1549
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:00,140
I'm sorry.

1550
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:02,140
I must be crazy.

1551
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,140
But there are conditions.

1552
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:08,140
You can do as much as you did to me.

1553
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:12,140
What's that?

1554
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:14,140
I won't do it.

1555
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:20,140
I'm sorry.

1556
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:22,140
I'm sorry.

1557
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:24,140

1558
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:26,140
I'm sorry.

1559
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,140
I'm sorry.

01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:30,140
I'm sorry.

1561
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:32,140
I'm sorry.

1562
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:34,140
I'm sorry.

1563
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:36,140
I'm sorry.

1564
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:38,140
I'm sorry.

1565
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:40,140
I'm sorry.

1566
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:42,140
I'm sorry.

1567
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:44,140
I'm sorry.

1568
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:46,140
I'm sorry.

1569
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,100
I'm sorry.

1570
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:51,100
I'm sorry.

1571
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:53,100
I'm sorry.

1572
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,100
I'm sorry.

1573
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:57,100
I'm sorry.

1574
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,100
I'm sorry.

1575
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:01,100
I'm sorry.

1576
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,100
I'm sorry.

1577
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,100
I'm sorry.

1578
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,100
I'm sorry.

1579
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:09,100
I'm sorry.

1580
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:11,100
I'm sorry.

1581
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,100
I'm sorry.

1582
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:15,100
I'm sorry.

1583
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:18,060
I'm gonna stay right here my mind.

01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:22,060
I'm never gonna let you down.

1585
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:26,060
I'm gonna let my heart stay for you.

1586
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:34,060
I'm never gonna feel alone.

1587
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:38,060
I'm gonna be there for you.

1588
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:42,060
I'm gonna let my heart stay for you.

1589
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:50,060
Oh, I see it's you.

1590
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:54,060
I wanna be with you.

1591
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:58,060
I wanna be with you my love.

1592
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:08,060
The time I say I need you now.

1593
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:15,020
Tell me everything, cuz I'll be next to you.

1594
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:19,020
I'm gonna stay right here my mind.

1595
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:23,020
I'm never gonna let you down.

1596
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:31,020
I'm gonna let my heart stay for you now.

1597
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:35,020
I'm never gonna feel alone.

1598
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,980
I'm gonna be there for you.

1599
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:43,980
I'm gonna let my heart stay for you now.

1600
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:08,580
I'm never gonna be alone.

1601
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:11,580
I'm gonna be there for you.

1602
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:15,580

I'm never gonna feel alone.

1604
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:29,580
I'm never gonna feel alone.

1605
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:31,580
I really like you!

1606
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:34,580
I love you, Oh Sun Woo!

1607
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:37,580
Thank you for liking me.

1608
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:41,580
I really liked you too.

1609
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:32,580
I will.

1610
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:35,580
I hope so.

1611
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:06,580
The boy we liked back then was our dream and youth.

1612
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:13,580
I'm still dreaming of that dream and I will never wake up.

1613
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:01,580
I thought of you.

1614
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,580
I thought of you every day.

1615
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:07,580
The feelings that I couldn't tell you.

1616
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:11,580
The feelings that I couldn't reach you.

1617
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:18,580
We will keep our beautiful fluttering feelings.

1618
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:25,580
Your smile in my eyes shined.

1619
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:30,580
I was also shining when I looked at you.

1620
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:37,580
Sometimes like moonlight, like summer night light.

1621
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:46,580
We were colored blue and we liked each other.

1622
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:47,580
Goodbye.

1623
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:49,580
Goodbye.

1624
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:52,580
We are now far apart.

1625
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:57,580
I drew you in my heart.

1626
01:38:58,580 --> 01:39:00,580
I always drew you.

1627
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:02,580
Goodbye.

1628
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:10,580
I thought of your true self who protected me.

1629
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:14,580
I always thought of you.

1630
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:17,580
I couldn't tell you.

1631
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:21,580
The feelings that I couldn't reach you.

1632
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:28,580
We will keep our beautiful love.

1633
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:34,580
Your smile in my eyes shined.

1634
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:40,580
I was also shining when I looked at you.

1635
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:47,580
Sometimes like moonlight, like summer night light.

1636
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:57,580
We were colored blue and we liked each other.

1637
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:01,580
I know we can't go back.

1638
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:07,580
It was pure then.

1639
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:14,580
All the moments we spent together are precious.

1640
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:21,580
Even if time passes and the future is lost, we will never forget.

1641
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:28,580
If we cried as much as we were in pain, would we have cried it out?

1642
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:35,580
If we cried as much as we were in pain, would we have cried it out?

1643
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:41,580
If we cried as much as we were in pain, would we have cried it out?

1644
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:48,580
We are like a movie, like the old days.

1645
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:57,580
If we go back, I'll just hold you with a smile.

1646
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:15,580
Thank you for watching!
