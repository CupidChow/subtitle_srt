1
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,501
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,181
What are you trying to do?
Give it back to me!

3
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:28,244
Give me back!

4
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,736
Okay, I will give it back.

5
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:33,742
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,870
What's wrong with you?

7
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:37,922
You never left me alone.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,695
If I let you go,

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,590
I would have no one, and the same with you.

10
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:43,197
So why would I leave you?

11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,126
Are you friends with me for some benefits?

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,290
Yes, I am.

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,884
But I have never seen any benefits
that I can get from you.

14
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:52,587
You always wreck me!

15
00:00:53,228 --> 00:00:54,939
Damn cute!

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,915
P'Q is calling.

17
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,783
Hello.

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,431
I am here at the restaurant with Fon.

19
00:01:07,556 --> 00:01:09,955
I will wait for you here.

20
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:15,424
Fon, I will go for dinner with P'Q.

21
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:16,883
That’s your own business.

22
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:20,040
You don't need to sulk, please.

23
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:21,455
Don't do this!

24
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,030
I gotta go.

25
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:25,798
- Okay.
- Byebye.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,236
This is the way it is.

27
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:36,023
When I see you get along well with him,

28
00:01:36,048 --> 00:01:37,070
it hurts me.

29
00:01:37,802 --> 00:01:39,742
But I couldn't stand for your sadness.

30
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,384
That’s the reason I surrender,
rather than getting myself hurt

31
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,415
because I can't see her getting hurt...

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,390
just like that.

33
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:54,556
(Fragment)

34
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:10,564
Have you waited for long?

35
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,015
I just arrived.

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,236
Are you going to order some food?

37
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,150
P'Q is on the way here.

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,079
Okay.

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,244
Why does he need to be here?

40
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,642
Why can't he?

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,190
He wants to come here.

42
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,560
Is it okay?

43
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:23,230
What does it matter?

44
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,601
Because we are here
for examination tutoring,

45
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:27,079
I'm worried that you cannot focus.

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,710
It's okay.

47
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:31,860
He arrived already.

48
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,478
Hi.

49
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,485
Hi.

50
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,525
Have you been waiting long?

51
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,810
Not that long.

52
00:02:48,353 --> 00:02:49,680
Are you "Fon"?

53
00:02:49,845 --> 00:02:50,947
Yes.

54
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,775
Why are you so quiet?

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,587
Can we start tutoring?

56
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:06,365
Okay, just start.

57
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,650
Have you ever read it?

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,197
I haven't.

59
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:09,939
I'm...

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,517
I want you to tutor me.

61
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,045
The examination is about..

62
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,060
Photo size…

63
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,860
It mainly consists of

64
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:18,375
close-ups,
medium,

65
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,556
and long-shots.

66
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:24,312
Damn it! Why do we need to know it?
We're going to graduate.

67
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,150
Even when you're going to graduate,
you still don't know.

68
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,314
Then,

69
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,130
I will test you on some of them.

70
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,719
Okay.

71
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:38,810
Starting from...

72
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:39,915
this one.

73
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,822
When we take a photo from a long distance,

74
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,540
what is it call?

75
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:47,200
It is...

76
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,540
medium!

77
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,630
No! It calls long-shot!

78
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,720
Damn!

79
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,197
Remember it.

80
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:01,795
Moreover,

81
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,572
There’s also an extreme close-up
and extreme long-shot.

82
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:09,480
So excessive!

83
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:10,853
You’re making me anxious!

84
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:13,650
You are going to remember it soon.

85
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,423
Eventually remember that.

86
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:16,751
Okay.

87
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,617
That's all about it.

88
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:20,908
I will LINE you for all of them.

89
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:22,075
Gotta go.

90
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,355
Where are you going?

91
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,540
I need to go somewhere else.

92
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:28,417
Okay, see you soon. Thank you for today.

93
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,805
Once again,

94
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,150
it hurts me.

95
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,003
It's not true when people say.

96
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,560
"I’m happy as long as you’re happy."

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,310
We all get hurt.

98
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,611
But we pretend that we’re fine.

99
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:54,275
(2 hours later)
Can you come here for me?

100
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,423
What happened? You were okay before I left.

101
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:14,038
After you left,

102
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:15,527
he told me something.

103
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:17,595
"Can you break off ties with Fon?"

104
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,570
We are friends. Why would we need that?

105
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:22,325
And then he told me that

106
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,625
you want to be more than friends,

107
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,570
you have a crush on me.

108
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:30,230
He's worried when we are together.

109
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,478
He needs me to choose between him and you.

110
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:35,455
It's nonsense.

111
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,103
What's P'Q said...

112
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,845
is true.

113
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:49,583
Yes, I admire you.

114
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,947
I've been hiding this for a long time.

115
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,160
It's good, if you are able to choose.

116
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,064
I don't want to keep being like this anymore.

117
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,800
My mood right now...

118
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,580
it seems like
"Sunny from Peun Sa Nit the movie".

119
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,990
Is time flying by slower?

120
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,470
One minute seems longer than 60 seconds.

121
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,334
Everything passes slower.

122
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,200
A loss of sensation...

123
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,270
Is this what it feels like
to be broken hearted?

124
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,920
This is what I'm afraid.

125
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:00,915
I am relieved,

126
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,040
but extremely hurt.

127
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:15,736
Can we start a relationship?
