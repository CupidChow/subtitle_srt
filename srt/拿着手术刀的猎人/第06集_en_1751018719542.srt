00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,630
(Park Joo Hyun)

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,870
(Park Yong-woo)

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,330
(Kang Hoon)

4
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,070
(Hunter with a scalpel)

5
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,130
(The names of the places and characters in this drama
The background setting is purely fictional and has nothing to do with reality)

6
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,070
(Child actors are accompanied by their guardians during filming
Animal scenes have experts on site and follow animal protection regulations)

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,800
I don't want to cut

8
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,330
I also want to grow long hair like my sister

9
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,600
What nonsense

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,800
How beautiful you are now

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,930
Didn't Dad say that?

12
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,030
We are

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,170
Different from other ordinary children

14
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,530
When I went on a business trip with my father

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,330
Short hair is more convenient, isn't it?

16
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,830
(Gao Enshu)

17
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,330
Almost done

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,130
How about it? It's beautiful, right?

19
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,700
Eun-seo, come here

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,270
Let's take a photo together after a long time.

21
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,233
Shien put his hand down

22
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:05,233
Look at the lens

23
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,067
Just look at the lens

24
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,433
I want to take a photo

25
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,170
One Two

26
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,370
(Hunter with a scalpel)

27
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,430
(Episode 6)

28
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,100
madman

29
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,230
He really tried hard to ask us to play with him.

30
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,970
hateful

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,470
The ink on the report I wrote today hasn't even dried yet.

32
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,830
Deliberately want us to eat turtle

33
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,330
Near the police station

34
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,000
The director will go crazy again if he finds out.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,070
Damn

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,700
How did that guy know this late at night?

37
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,100
- Get him out of here
-yes

38
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,470
Brother, why are you here again?

39
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,430
Let's go out first.

40
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,570
- Get out first
- What is it?

41
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,430
No photography allowed

42
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,830
Please go out first

43
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,070
Are you scared?

44
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,230
no

45
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,200
Who discovered it first?

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,070
Yes, this is our district.

47
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,470
Around 2:24

48
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,400
Received a report of a body being found

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,870
After finding out it was a homicide, they immediately took control of the scene.

50
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,370
Did the original reporter leave any personal information?

51
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,400
This one... She should be around here

52
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,500
Over there

53
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,370
After confirming the site, apply for a photo check.

54
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,500
Because the experience is complete.

55
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,870
Are you doubting me?

56
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,970
I feel like I'm under investigation now

57
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,700
No, I doubt you.

58
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,000
Even if a temporary autopsy room is set up

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,100
It's not like every time you need an autopsy

60
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,700
You are such a busy person, but you live here directly.

61
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,530
Even if it's about your team members, it's still a little suspicious.

62
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,170
Does Guokesou agree with you to do this?

63
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,600
You are asked to personally participate in the investigation and find the body.

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,730
Does Guokesou also have skip-level promotions?

65
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,370
If you solve a big case, you can rise quickly.

66
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,200
Well, detectives,

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,000
What if a team member is killed?
Will you still remain indifferent?

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,070
You just called me suspicious, didn't you?

69
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,970
I think your reaction is weird.

70
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,330
The second victim, Wu Minhao

71
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,230
He's the medical examiner in charge of this case.

72
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,730
So far no one has found out

73
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,670
Why did forensic doctor Wu become the target of this case?

74
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,200
We also...

75
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Our scientific research is more than ever
Take this case more seriously.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Set up a temporary autopsy room at Ryongchon University Hospital

77
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,030
It is also to show our determination to investigate the case.

78
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,070
He even said he was promoted above his level... That's amazing

79
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,800
Just saying it casually

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,600
The search was originally to start
Start by carefully checking the small places

81
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,230
If Chief Rui Ke could be like today

82
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,530
An autopsy at the crime scene would be a good thing for us.

83
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,970
It will definitely help us with our investigation.

84
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,600
I am Zheng Zhengxian

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,870
OK, I know.

86
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,630
The autopsy has been requested. Let's go.

87
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,670
She really doesn't hold back when she speaks.

88
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,670
Really indifferent

89
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,530
I don’t think…

90
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,270
Is she a little scary?

91
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,130
When she spoke

92
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,630
Eyes never blinked

93
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,670
It's like...

94
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,500
To make sure your lies are not discovered

95
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,130
You guys are really

96
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,870
People who deal with corpses every day
Of course it will be cold and scary

97
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,800
Will it be cheerful and lively?

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,730
What are you talking about?

99
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,030
sorry

100
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,330
They didn't mean that.

101
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,600
It's just that the atmosphere in our group is not very good right now.

102
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,200
I can't find any clues, but I still have to find a way to solve the case.

103
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,800
Everyone has become very sensitive

104
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,530
I understand

105
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,400
I really can't find the time to fix the car. It's really cold.

106
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,800
It doesn't matter

107
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,970
sorry

108
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,630
You must be frightened by the corpse.

109
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,200
Even though I perform autopsies every day and face corpses

110
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,400
-It would probably scare you too...
- I'm not afraid

111
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,030
He's dead anyway.

112
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,270
But you were wandering around outside alone in the early morning

113
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,300
Horrible accidents may happen

114
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,130
I know the case is related to your colleague, so you will be anxious.

115
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,200
But if you act alone, something bad will happen.

116
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,230
We too... must act as a group

117
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,800
Team Leader Zheng seems to have always been acting alone

118
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,470
Hey, why do you keep bringing up the past?

119
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,770
It's much better now.

120
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,570
Anyway, if something happens later

121
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,670
Just contact me directly

122
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,100
Just in case, this is for you

123
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,100
What's this

124
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,430
Well...

125
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,770
The murderer is a dangerous person

126
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,470
I am a little worried about the murder of forensic doctor Wu

127
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm worried about you

128
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,670
I don't know if this kind of thing is useful.

129
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,700
Anyway, they would call the police only after meeting the murderer face to face.

130
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,470
I don't know what the meaning of this thing is

131
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,230
Or do you want a follower?
Following you 24 hours a day

132
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,930
This or follow me, you choose one.

133
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,630
At least it's better than nothing.

134
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,570
(Please help me!)

135
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,000
Let’s start collecting samples

136
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,600
(Zheng Yiying)

137
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,500
The cross section of the corpse shrinks inward and dries

138
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,030
For posthumous truncation

139
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,970
The entire left hand can be seen very deep

140
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,170
Active or passive defensive traces

141
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,770
There are signs of peeling from the wrist to the palm

142
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,230
Venous punctate bleeding

143
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,000
tweezers

144
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,570
There seems to be something in the mouth

145
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,030
Just look at the lens

146
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,500
How old is she?

147
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,530
7 years old?

148
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,630
I don't know

149
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,970
It's hard to judge the child's age.

150
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,370
In the oral cavity oropharyngeal airway

151
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,900
Found a piece of photo paper rolled into a cylinder

152
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,130
Width 8 cm Length 10 cm

153
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,900
Confirmed as a photo

154
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,700
(Temporary store closure)

155
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,330
You must have been shocked.

156
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,570
The woman's white legs

157
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,630
Just blocking my door like this

158
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,630
I couldn't move at that moment

159
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,670
Frightened and fell to the ground

160
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,330
How could this happen?

161
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,130
Why don't you call the patrol to clean up?

162
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,070
Of course I called

163
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,170
But the lady upstairs in my house said

164
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,200
Nothing can be done until the forensics team arrives.

165
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,400
Come forward and stop us

166
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,970
No, we should first care about the people who are scared to death.

167
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,800
It's so cold-blooded.

168
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,430
No matter how I think about it,

169
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,900
That lady is a jinx.

170
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,970
What

171
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,130
It must be that lady who brought the ghost here.

172
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,800
Since she came to rent the house

173
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,300
I just think she's eerie and not right.

174
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,500
but…

175
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,200
Where is President Choi when such a big thing happened?

176
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,200
(Temporary store closure)
He should be back late today.

177
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Didn't he say he was going to the graves of his children and his wife?

178
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,070
Oh no

179
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,130
I'm too scared to live here anymore

180
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,000
(Danxiang Village)

181
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:12,330
That's my dad and sister.

182
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,170
The place where we lived together before

183
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,100
Our home is much better.

184
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,600
This must be the message from the criminal.

185
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,170
This serial killer loves to show off.

186
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,500
This means that the child is closely related to his crime.

187
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,870
Did you see the sea behind?

188
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,570
Wasn't sodium found in the soil in the last Li Yuanzhu case?

189
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,730
This means that the crime scene is a salty area.

190
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,430
Don't you think the clues are fitting together?

191
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,330
It's hard to say

192
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,630
Didn't Li Yuanzhu's body get found?
Cleaner and brush?

193
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,900
The cleaning agent was also found in the body of Wu the forensic doctor.

194
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,530
Seeing this reminded me of something.

195
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,970
That was a case I reported when I was a student.

196
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,100
The "Blue Bucket Case" occurred in Qingyun Port in 1999

197
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,370
When cleaning or pickling

198
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,670
Don't we all use that blue plastic bucket?

199
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,830
Body parts that had been brushed with detergent were found inside.

200
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,530
What did the criminal use to brush?

201
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,370
A brush, of course.

202
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,400
What do you think?

203
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,170
At first glance, it does sound a bit like

204
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,930
But it still seems too far-fetched.

205
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,170
And there was no clue found in that case.

206
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,070
It is true.

207
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,430
Also correct

208
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,270
A drug called Pavlon was also found in that case.

209
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,130
If drugs with similar ingredients are also detected this time

210
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,770
We can combine the investigation with that case.

211
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,770
When will I receive the results?

212
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,770
DNA and drug test reports of photos

213
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,870
- Chief Rui
-What

214
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,500
The photo has traces of film cleaner being used to remove it

215
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Even if the DNA test

216
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,000
It's useless if there's no control group.

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,230
Accurate test results

218
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,570
Usually seven days

219
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,870
No, this is an emergency case.
Can't it be faster?

220
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,900
From preliminary inspection and collection to analysis

221
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,900
No matter how hard I work

222
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
At least four days

223
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,170
OK

224
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,570
I hope you can handle it as soon as possible.

225
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,300
There is currently no direct evidence

226
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,700
This photo may be a major clue

227
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,070
But I did say

228
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,530
Didn't you find any clues in the blue barrel incident?

229
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,070
I've looked before.

230
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,370
That case...

231
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,830
I also think there are similarities

232
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,430
this…

233
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,130
This is what I did

234
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,500
Do you want it?

235
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,570
(White Snow and Red Rose)

236
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,070
(3D simulation image restoration system)
Found a clue?

237
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,200
The child in the photo is the key clue

238
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,370
Even so, at this critical moment
Is it reasonable to search for missing children?

239
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,000
What about the investigation now?
Are you going to leave it alone?

240
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,830
That just extends the investigation.

241
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,070
Unidentified fingerprints found in the first two cases

242
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,030
It is also possible that they are underage children.

243
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,130
But the leader

244
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,470
Currently, whether it is adult women or missing children

245
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,570
There are too many to investigate.

246
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,000
How can we be enough with just the four of us?

247
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,530
If you want to investigate, you must first lock in the control group

248
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,070
So I thought about it

249
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,270
How about investigating the unsolved cases together?

250
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,100
There is an incident called "Blue Bucket Case"

251
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,300
It was a dismemberment case that happened in Qingyun Port in 1999.

252
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,330
Hello

253
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,870
Are you crazy?

254
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,030
The media is already watching
How can you criticize us?

255
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,530
You said you wanted to investigate missing children.
Even the unsolved case

256
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,830
But the prisoner used detergent to clean the body.

257
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,970
It is very similar to the method of dismembering a body along the joints...

258
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,370
It's so noisy

259
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,400
Adding staff

260
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,200
Can we discuss this after the simulated portrait comes out?

261
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,730
- End of meeting
-Section Chief

262
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,530
You really don't know how high the sky is. What are you talking about?

263
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,030
That's a hot potato.

264
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,930
hateful

265
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,400
-Don't do that...
-Don't stop me...

266
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,230
I'm not going to argue with him.

267
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,100
You have to convince him.

268
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,230
If he lets us do whatever we want, we'll all be doomed.

269
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,500
I know. I'll tell you later.

270
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,730
Be Cool

271
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,530
Damn

272

(Danxiang Village)
Looking back

273
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:37,000
We were really happy in Helong.

274
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,870
Actually, if it wasn't for Eun-seo's relationship

275
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,700
We should still be together now.

276

1999 Qingyungang Blue Barrel Dismemberment Murder Case

281
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,530
The only suspect at the time was Godussen

282
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,930
(Witness: Ms. Hyun Jin-sook, 43 years old)
Due to eyewitness testimony

283
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,730
He was the last person to be with the victim.

284
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,570
Police at a residence in Danhyang Village, Halong, South Chungcheong Province

285
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,570
Arrest him urgently

286
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,870
However, due to insufficient evidence, he was released after only two days in detention.

287
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,000
It was later discovered that the witness suffered from schizophrenia

288
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,730
Plus residents' complaints

289
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,730
Eventually he was removed from the suspect list.

How is the house?

299
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,830
Because you're coming, I repainted the whole place

300
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,500
You look more normal than I expected.

301
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,300
I have confirmed it with my own eyes

302
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,300
You fell down the hill.

303
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,600
Someone who picked herbs happened to save me.

304
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,230
Fortunately, I met him

305
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,700
It seems that the person who collects herbs

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,430
Your face was more beautiful before

313
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,730
The nose moved.

314
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,670
Why did you become like this?

315
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,870
My Shien used to have a round nose.

316
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,370

You are my daughter, right?

322
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,000
You never treated me as a daughter. I was just an assistant.

Only I will love you with all my heart

343
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,370
Then you will agree to anything I ask.

344
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,300
certainly

345
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,470
I just want one thing now

346
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,930
What's up

347
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,330
I want to...

348
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,900
You go to hell

00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,430
How dare you wield a knife at my father?

350
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,630
-Where
- This way

351
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,830

354
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,130
Did you lose your mind when you thought of Eun-seo?

355
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,270
That's right

356
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,000
I just want you to remember her.

357
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,470
Let you feel it thoroughly

358
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,430
How did she destroy you?

359
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,470
So what happened to Eun-seo?

360
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,970
Did you kill her?
