1
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,410
On this birthday

2
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,420
My sister will throw me a birthday party without telling dad.

3
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,130
Just roughly clean up this place with rocks

4
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,750
I'll wash it all tomorrow

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,720
Change your clothes and do it, if you jump in you'll stink

6
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,990
Okay, so I was attacked while I was sleeping.

7
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,280
Why did that woman show up and attack me again?

8
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,820
And you treated him?

9
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,990
Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's right! Yes?

10
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,870
How many times do I have to say this!

11
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,330
Okay, okay, look, look, okay?

12
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,840
It's all sewn up here, right?

13
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,130
wait for a sec

14
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,800
Is that woman really this woman?

15
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,090
Yes, that's right

16
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,890
That's right, that's right!

17
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,720
But why didn't you report it right away?

18
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,720
How is it?

19
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,730
They say if you don't want to die, hide for a week.

20
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,150
Oh, I told you that if you didn't listen, I was going to kill you.

21
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,650
If you don't want to die

22
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,450
Been hiding for a week

23
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,410
Do you remember who attacked first?

24
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,290
no

25
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,290
Oh, that happened so quickly

26
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,170
ah

27
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,670
What smell? What smell?

28
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,590
smell of rocks

29
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,300
That's right

30
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
It came out of my hand

31
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,970
I'm sleeping

32
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,260
Then that pungent smell of laxatives came in

33
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,020
I'm deep in here

34
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,520
Detective Se-Hyeon is talking

35
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,320
I've been living off energy bars for the past 5 years.

36
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,360
They say killing takes a lot of energy

37
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,660
Would a child like that commit such a heinous act?

38
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,330
You said you didn't believe me

39
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,250
But what else do you need to say?

40
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,510
What did Kwon Hyung-jo say?

41
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,840
Oh, things have gotten really funny.

42
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,550
They say there is someone else who attacked you

43
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,260
Seo Se-Hyeon actually gave her treatment?

44
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,810
then

45
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,890
In the first place, Manager Seo wasn't the culprit.

46
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,350
That's how it happens

47
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,150
I couldn't see his face, but he was a man.

48
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,280
You said your hands smelled like bleach?

49
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,700
Does it smell like rocks? Yes.

50
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,450
Surely it's as the team leader said

51
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,250
It seems more likely to be Choi Min-guk

52
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,540
And Seo Se-Hyeon for some reason

53
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,840
I already knew about Choi Min-guk's existence

54
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,050
He may be an accomplice

55
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,630
It might not be the case, considering he attacked Choi Min-guk.

56
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,720
Oh, of course

57
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,560
They may have conspired to confuse the investigation.

58
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,980
No, that won't be the case.

59
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,190
Oh, well, we'll find out if we investigate.

60
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,820
The problem is this

61
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,150
The team leader

62
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,740
It'll be very difficult to get the chief's approval.

63
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,950
With the public wanted list and Kang Soo-dae's presence

64
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,410
Hey

65
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,290
Oh, I wonder if Team Leader Hong could raise the flag a bit, right?

66
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,290
I will do it without your permission.

67
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,210
yes?

68
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,540
Senior

69
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,630
Please help me

70
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,130
Yongcheon Clean Laundry CEO Choi Min-guk

71
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,340
I said we should investigate him as a strong suspect.

72
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,720
therefore

73
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,100
You said you'd do it after Seo Se-hyeon caught it, but don't you understand?

74
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,020
Hey, what do you think, Team Leader Hong?

75
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,110
Just because it smelled like rocks

76
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,980
Choi Min-guk, the current victim of the 5th incident

77
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,900
Can't we just assume he's a suspect?

78
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,160
And I heard that he has a disability in his legs.

79
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
The suspect in the CCTV of the second bus

80
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,330
In the process of chasing the victim

81
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,250
showed normal gait

82
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,370
okay?

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,420
Oh, yeah, well, that's true

84
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,340
And the point of contact for the first and third victims is the laundry shop run by CEO Choi Min-guk.

85
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,170
Of course, it should be investigated

86
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,140
I understand that the investigation has already been conducted

87
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,970
Yes? Oh, yes

88
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,310
Oh, yeah, what

89
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,770
Because back then the situation was a bit different from now

90
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,810
No, I'm investigating the witness

91
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,400
Are you saying that it depends on the situation?

92
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,650
No, that's not it

93
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,480
No, but Team Leader Hong really talks strangely, huh?

94
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,030
No, so what are you saying is we've been messing around with the investigation until now?

95
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,490
It's noisy

96
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,990
What did you do to deserve raising your voice?

97
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,620
Team Leader Hong did all the work for me

98
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,580
Are you just having some free time?

99
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,750
You, Changjin

100
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,710
Go down to the traffic department right away starting today.

101
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,040
Hey, chief

102
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,630
Oh, that's a bit

103
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,590
Incidents keep happening

104
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,130
A kid who was just dragged around helplessly

105
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,220
Where are you talking about American products without any fear?

106
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,600
You're touching innocent civilians who have no connection to anything?

107
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,520
Go down and reflect before you take off your clothes.

108
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,600
Oh, brother!

109
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,900
What if you really go?

110
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,980
Oh, just hold on tight!

111
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,530
Even if I try to open the stomach, it'll just burst my stomach.

112
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,160
No, I can't. I'll just go and take it.

113
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,320
Just stand still

114
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,200
Oh, then, even knowing this unreasonable situation

115
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,620
Are you telling me to stay still, right now?

116
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,160
Hey, stay still

117
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,830
It's okay, I'll be back soon.

118
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,120
But Team Leader Jeong isn't here either

119
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,040
Oh, if you go too, my brother, our team will be completely torn in half.

120
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,340
kid

121
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,470
Me, that, Min-guk hyung, no

122
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,010
Min-guk Choi, are you giving up like this?

123
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,850
Why give up? We need to investigate.

124
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,430
Yes? Then, is there a big picture that you designed?

125
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
hey

126
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,230
Team Leader Jeong's personality

127
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,110
I'm sure I'll be able to hang on even if I'm alone

128
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,360
Shouldn't we help out a little bit too?

129
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,610
Oh, then of course we should go too.

130
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,860
You guys are out

131
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,160
This is ridiculous! Why are we missing out!

132
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,080
Hey, Inma, how long has it been since you joined the Power Team?

133
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,370
It just keeps growing

134
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,710
With my accumulated investigative know-how,

135
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,330
It can prolong life in an emergency, but

136
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,790
Hey, you're a human, you're just out

137
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,550
no way

138
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,340
Brother, you're not in a position to take such an adventure.

139
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,260
My sister-in-law seems to be feeling a little sick and is taking it easy.

140
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,050
This just won't pass, will it?

141
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,930
My brother's pension is at stake, so I'll just do it

142
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,600
My wife won't say anything

143
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,520
I've become a fan of Team Leader Jeong in the meantime

144
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,030
Hey, that kid, even in the midst of all that busy work

145
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,700
He took great care of my wife as she was in and out of the hospital room.

146
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,660
Go

147
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,240
I don't know what you're up to, brother.

148
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,620
I don't know about Seok-woo, but don't even dream of getting rid of me, okay?

149
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,290
Hey, what are you doing? Hey, I absolutely can't get off either.

150
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,130
Get on, brother! Let's go!

151
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,290
hey

152
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,590
Oh, this bird

153
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,840
Yes, sir

154
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,680
Where are you?

155
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,100
Oh, that's near the police station.

156
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,430
I also moved to the civil affairs office today!

157
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,640
Senior, is it because of me?

158
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,150
Yes! It's 100% because of the team leader.

159
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,440
So from now on, you have to listen to me.

160
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,360
Yes? Before Choi Min-guk was discharged from the hospital.

161
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,450
I'm thinking about robbing the laundry shop

162
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,240
Can you come now?

163
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,530
If you don't come, it's a betrayal, a betrayal! Team leader, you must come!

164
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,450
Almost there now!

165
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,910
I'm really upset, if you don't come for a long time!

166
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,140
Have you finished the discharge procedures? Oh, yes.

167
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,470
Come visit our laundry shop later.

168
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,770
I take responsibility

169
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,850
We will definitely give a 30% discount to our nurses.

170
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,230
Oh my, really?

171
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,020
Oh, yes, please spread the word.

172
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,630
But senior

173
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,040
Is it okay for the civil affairs office seat to remain empty?

174
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,880
Oh, what, what is it, what

175
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,300
Isn't lunch time an excuse?

176
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,510
sorry

177
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,890
For no reason because of me

178
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,970
Hey, stop it!

179
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,140
Brother, look here.

180
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,730
It looks like a girl's room

181
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,150
But didn't you say that Choi Min-guk's daughter died?

182
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,240
container

183
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,490
Right?

184
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,170
What the heck?

185
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,160
hey

186
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,830
There aren't any fingerprints?

187
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,750
Oh, how could that be possible without deliberately erasing it?

188
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,000
Team leader

189
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,250
Choi Min-guk has appeared, Choi Min-guk

190
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,300
Come, come

191
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,170
Please give me some time

192
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,600
Brother, I'm surprised

193
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,360
Hey, are you discharged from the hospital already?

194
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,030
Yeah ah

195
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
what

196
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,490
There was no serious injury

197
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,880
Me, brother

198
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,250
He, he returned to the scene of the incident so quickly

199
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,090
Is the doctor okay?

200
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,340
Yes? That

201
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,300
Post-traumatic stress disorder? Well, there's something like that.

202
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,760
You've been through such a hard time here, yes

203
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,970
Just, the events of that day just came to mind, yeah

204
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,100
It's annoying

205
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,440
are you okay

206
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,400
Oh, I see

207
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,150
Detective Park

208
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,960
You're talking a bit too long today.

209
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,920
ah

210
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,210
Me?

211
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,680
Huh? Huh, bro, just a minute

212
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,100
Yes, brother

213
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,520
Oh, yes, I will go now.

214
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,560
Brother, I'll go first

215
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,560
Yes, brother, ah, yes, yes, yes

216
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,140
If you cut towards the inside of the blade, it will cut better.

217
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,520
No need to hurt your pride

218
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,360
When I was young too

219
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,780
My sister told me everything

220
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,280
I can do it by myself

221
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,920
But my dad said that

222
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,380
Sister, you said your sister killed you?

223
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,380
Sister, sister

224
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,210
Is that Eunseo?

225
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,230
I think I need to go to the hospital.

226
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,860
No, you have to stay here until dad comes.

227
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,480
I'm in serious condition

228
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,740
Do you think your dad will just leave you alone if I do something wrong?

229
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,950
Just a moment

230
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,630
Do you know what that is?

231
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,170
It's a watch

232
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,130
That's not just a watch

233
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,470
When you need help

234
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,100
It's a very special watch that can call someone.

235
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,890
Oh, that's ridiculous

236
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,060
Don't you believe it?

237
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,560
Long press the big button next to it

238
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,110
The red button is floating

239
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,860
Just press that

240
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,900
then

241
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,360
Someone will come to save you.

242
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,160
Then who's coming? Dad?

243
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,910
at that time

244
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,290
The person you want to see the most

245
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,260
Look, that won't work.

246
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,060
That's because the battery is dead

247
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,020
If you pretend to charge your dad's phone

248
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,480
Oh, I know what it is

249
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,150
This is where you plug in the wire.

250
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,230
that's right

251
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,900
You're smart

252
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,990
Sister, sister!

253
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,630
Yes, this is Choi Min-guk.

254
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,040
Hello, this is Mr. Choi from Yongcheonseo Joint Team.

255
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,920
Oh, yes, hello

256
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,960
Yes, but why

257
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,590
Yes, nothing else

258
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,260
Uh, we're in this attack

259
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,760
I would like to conduct a reference investigation.

260
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,970
I'm sorry, but you're still recovering.

261
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,560
Would you be able to visit today?

262
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,560
Oh, oh, yes

263
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,850
Or to where we are

264
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,480
Oh, I have to go.

265
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,230
Yes, everyone is working hard day and night

266
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,320
See you later then

267
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,480
Yes, yes, I understand.

268
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,440
Then I will come to you within an hour.

269
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,360
yes

270
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,740
Those idiots

271
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,700
Investigate for a hundred days, day and night

272
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,160
Sister

273
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,790
are you okay?

274
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,420
Sister

275
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,670
Sister, are you okay?

276
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,880
Hey ah

277
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,090
It's me, sir

278
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,680
Did something come out?

279
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,430
Um, that's it

280
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,600
yesterday

281
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,100
Did you deposit the car rental fee?

282
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,190
Rental car?

283
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,480
No, why did the gentleman in the hospital rent it?

284
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,980
Is it suspicious?

285
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,160
Rental car number not confirmed?

286
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Hand over

287
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,830
Brother Changjin

288
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,410
Can I get CCTV there?

289
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,590
The car that Choi Min-guk rented just passed through Yongcheon IC.

290
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,540
I'm still tracking it

291
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,460
I will share it with you as soon as I confirm the location.

292
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,010
Take the highway first

293
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,770
"72 hours"

294
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,830
dad

295
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,960
How are you, sister?

296
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,750
I need to go to the hospital

297
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,520
To go on a boat by the appointed time

298
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,350
I have to leave right now

299
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,270
Where are we going?

300
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,110
Sister, you take care of it yourself

301
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,200
dad

302
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,420
dad

303
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,470
I'm so sick

304
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,880
'87 weeks 6890'

305
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,300
Senior, please check 6890 in 87 weeks

306
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,050
Diazepam

307
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,720
Amoxicillin

308
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,390
Oxycodone

309
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,720
please

310
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,730
It has to be these drugs

311
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,650
Got it?

312
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,750
Did you hear from your sister that you should buy some medicine?

313
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,410
Yes, I wrote it all down here.

314
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,090
You go and come back

315
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,380
Dad will take care of my sister

316
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,730
Come here

317
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,860
Just hold on a little longer

318
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,160
Dad's hands are healing hands

319
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,290
Dad's hands are healing hands

320
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,920
Yes, sir

321
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,550
Yes, I checked and it's 6890 at 87 weeks.

322
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,800
It was a vehicle number that had been reported stolen.

323
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,600
I found it. I'll take a picture of the location.

324
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,930
We're almost there now

325
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,020
Please wait a moment

326
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,190
Hey, team leader!

327
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,400
No matter what happens, never move alone.

328
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,440
You knew it, right?

329
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,800
Why don't you just come in with money?

330
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,510
That's what my sister wrote down

331
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,060
You need a prescription to buy it

332
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,860
What kind of medicine is it?

333
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,690
Open your hands

334
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,070
Hurry up!

335
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,090
dad

336
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,470
Show me your scars

337
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,470
Could you please buy me some first aid supplies?

338
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,750
Hey, team leader!

339
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,580
No matter what happens, never move alone.

340
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,590
You knew it, right?

341
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
Yes, welcome

342
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,390
Oh, yes, hello

343
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,310
Oh, yes, well, what would you like?

344
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,520
Oh, yes

345
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,810
My daughter got hurt a little bit, so mom

346
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,480
Oh my, oh my, what happened

347
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,690
no

348
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,780
But this isn't something you should come to the pharmacy for.

349
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,110
I think you should go to the hospital.

350
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,240
My daughter is a doctor, a doctor

351
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,200
No, still

352
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,040
I think you should go to the hospital.

353
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,200
it's okay

354
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,960
Because we only do basic treatment before going to the hospital

355
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,960
Anti-inflammatory pain reliever and wound ointment

356
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,840
Just give me a compression bandage and gauze.

357
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,090
Oh, yes

358
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,550
wait a minute

359
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,150
here

360
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,900
How much is it?

361
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,440
Yes, it's 8 thousand won.

362
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,490
Here it is, here it is

363
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,450
Yes, just a moment, yes

364
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,960
Dad! Dad!

365
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,340
Se-eun-ah, Se-eun-ah

366
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,050
Dad! Call the police right away!

367
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,720
Dad! Dad! Se-eun, Se-eun

368
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,930
