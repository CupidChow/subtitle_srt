1
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,900
What color do you want?

2
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,960
Wouldn't it look prettier this way?

3
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,420
The point is to stick a lot of stickers

4
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,680
There are so many expressions

5
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,570
So I went there and asked

6
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,280
Why did you help me?

7
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,280
So do you know what he said?

8
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,660
'I told you with my eyes'

9
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,120
'Please help me'

10
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,590
daughter

11
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,550
did you sleep well?

12
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,430
I brought the workbench, did you see it?

13
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,140
Now you need it too

14
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,440
Is what I brought yesterday any good?

15
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,560
curious?

16
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,110
We have to meet again

17
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,360
There's still work to be done

18
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,860
yes

19
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,490
There is work to be done

20
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,700
however

21
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,540
Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it from now on.

22
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,290
really?

23
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,590
Wow, you're all grown up

24
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,500
All grown up, my daughter

25
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,380
I can do it without my dad

26
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,340
But without dad's help

27
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,720
Will things go as you wish?

28
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,890
You'll know when you see it

29
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,850
Se-eun-ah

30
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,640
Dad

31
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,440
I trust you

32
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
You will come by yourself

33
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,150
In the end

34
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,350
Boy, there are already three victims.

35
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,100
Is it possible to identify a suspect with something like this?

36
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,940
What on earth is Manager Seo doing?

37
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,520
When did he start boasting that he would catch the criminal?

38
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,150
Just throwing a piece of paper like this, tsk, tsk

39
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,360
Hey, Manager Choi, yes

40
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,690
What should I do?

41
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,070
The reporters are standing there like that

42
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,740
Oh, yes, that

43
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,950
We are currently accepting montage reports, and

44
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,870
Oh, so these tips are all just useless stuff, huh?

45
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,830
Oh, the police for a day or two?

46
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,330
'Hey, if this keeps up, I'm going to end up like this.'

47
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,880
Doesn't this just make sense?

48
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,500
Yes, that's right

49
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,010
Even so, it was judged that reporting was ineffective.

50
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,180
He, mainly an illegal dealer of pancuronium

51
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,140
Oh, so, sir, what I'm saying is

52
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,100
Because the location of the suspect is being identified through bus CCTV,

53
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,230
yesterday

54
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,770
The background in the photo taken from the corpse

55
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,320
The result came out as Cheongun Port

56
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,490
This Cheongun Port is very similar to our case.

57
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,570
yes

58
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,660
Oh, that, that's what I was going to say too.

59
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,870
He asked for support in that area

60
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,660
We planned to investigate the area around Cheongun Port.

61
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,000
If you know where this photo was taken

62
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,120
Well, I was hoping that some kind of clue would come out of it.

63
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,870
Oh, but

64
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,130
Hey, Team Leader Jeong, what were you trying to say?

65
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,170
What is Cheongun Port?

66
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,960
Yes, that, that, that

67
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,930
Oh, because sodium came out in the first incident.

68
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,220
Well, isn't that the crime scene? Well, that's it.

69
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,350
That's it, right?

70
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,810
Yes, that's right

71
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,660
Okay, until this week

72
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,950
Arrest the suspect unconditionally

73
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,460
yes

74
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,260
Hey, there are things I can say and things I can't say in front of the chief.

75
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,550
Without any fear

76
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,680
Why on earth does it not work?

77
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,180
From Pancronium to Cheongunhang

78
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,010
I think there is now sufficient cause to investigate.

79
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,720
good

80
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,230
Then let's do it like this

81
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,560
If you have to touch the US even if you die

82
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,900
Get insurance

83
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,190
Insurance?

84
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,690
You said that Chief Hong Jin-woo of the Southern Youth Police Station was your senior, right?

85
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,690
Brother and sister

86
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,900
Yes, that's right

87
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,410
Go and ask for support, okay?

88
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,990
Even if we die and wake up, we can't touch the US.

89
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,750
I know that

90
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,660
Either you can cleverly drag the Southern Blue House in or keep your mouth shut.

91
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,550
madam

92
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,800
No, will the Southern District accept it?

93
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,890
One plus one is also good

94
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,100
A bomb with no suspects plus an unsolved bonus?

95
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,470
Hey, as the manager said

96
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,520
First, let's try to convince Kang Soo-dae.

97
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,980
Yes, I understand.

98
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,990
Manager Seo is hiding something

99
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,700
Pancuronium

100
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,790
Blue barrel

101
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,760
What was your expression yesterday?

102
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,140
The team leader is a good person

103
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,100
So don't support me

104
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,750
Oh my, it's already out?

105
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,590
Yes, yes, it came out

106
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,920
Oh my

107
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,340
How are you doing?

108
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,680
Yeah, Tina?

109
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,970
It's huge

110
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,930
Oh, my son's handwriting

111
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,020
Something wonderful happened

112
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,860
He was so angry that he asked why I was talking now, and he wrote

113
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,690
What do you mean, it's coming all at once?

114
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,360
'I'm busy, so I don't have to do that'

115
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,030
'Is Cebu next door?'

116
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,820
I must come and see my mother.

117
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,870
and

118
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,910
That's so good, huh?

119
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,500
Hey, you can wear this when you go to the airport.

120
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,210
When I looked at it while doing laundry

121
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,460
The clothes were bright and pretty.

122
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,710
Like the chairman

123
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,340
Oh! Really?

124
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,340
Oh, the chairman is so lucky.

125
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,340
I'm jealous

126
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,800
The following article

127
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,140
Ever since I was little, I've been sick of hearing people say I'm lucky.

128
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,770
Whew

129
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,230
Oh my, this is the problem when you get old

130
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,440
Keep blinking

131
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,940
Sorry, I was being useless in front of CEO Choi.

132
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,110
Oh, you're doing it again, huh? I told you not to do it.

133
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,820
And it's the chairman's job.

134
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,200
I'm so happy to have my daughter back, huh?

135
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,580
hello

136
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,920
hello

137
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,020
Thank you for your hard work.

138
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,100
Yes, sir, what's the matter?

139
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,520
Oh, because Yongcheonseo kept urging me

140
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,730
I think I need to take another look at the list of samples I've organized so far.

141
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,110
Oh, right

142
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,150
ah

143
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,620
It's strange, I clearly made a list of everything

144
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,700
Oh, when did he go out again?

145
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,830
Our guy, he's in charge of organizing the list

146
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,420
I think I'm out of the office for a moment, but I'll email you later.

147
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,290
Could you please do it now?

148
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,420
Because it's urgent

149
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,630
uh

150
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,630
It's not that difficult

151
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,010
all right

152
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,230
Oh, why aren't you answering the phone? Mr. Lee

153
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,110
Why are you carrying a cell phone?

154
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,910
seed

155
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,750
Hey, why aren't you answering the phone!

156
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,830
Follow me

157
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,420
Ah, hurry, it's here again, shit

158
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,860
Oh my

159
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,760
Manager Seo, you've been waiting for a long time. I'm sorry.

160
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,680
ah

161
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,800
Are you looking for a list of specimen samples from the Yongcheon incident?

162
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,100
Are you talking about the entire 1-3?

163
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,560
Yes, all of them

164
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,230
uh

165
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,190
Oh, hey, would you like something to drink?

166
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,570
Oh, yes

167
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,160
hello

168
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,290
Oh, Officer Kim

169
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,250
Yes, is this a strong team delivery?

170
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,670
Oh, yes

171
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,800
I guess I'm sleeping at the police station all day these days

172
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,800
It's just full of laundry.

173
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,550
Oh my, this is no joke.

174
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,050
He, ah, that

175
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,680
Is there anything out these days?

176
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,810
Oh, don't be ridiculous. There's no informant or reporting phone call.

177
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,350
It's really hard for detectives to run around on foot.

178
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,690
Whew

179
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,810
This is a big deal, this is a big deal.

180
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,320
Well, I just hope no new incidents occur.

181
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,570
this

182
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,780
This is something separate, there's no need to share it

183
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,740
Detective Park, just give it to me.

184
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,240
Oh, that's all for now

185
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,620
Should I just take this myself?

186
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,330
Oh, no, no, no

187
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,830
Yes, I will do it

188
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,870
Yes yes

189
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,540
yes

190
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,050
Thank you for your hard work. Yes, I understand.

191
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,760
Yes, thank you, go in. Yes.

192
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,920
Yes, yes

193
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,060
Have you finished your business?

194
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,020
What's that face?

195
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,360
Why a sample list?

196
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,150
what

197
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,360
I was wondering if there was anything I could request for a re-examination.

198
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,950
Re-examination?

199
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,040
I feel a little bad when I hear that our team is missing something.

200
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,790
No, well, that's not it.

201
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,960
You are the one

202
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,130
I forgot to take pancuronium from Yongcheonseo

203
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,800
Right? I missed that one.

204
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,430
somehow

205
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,350
I haven't been able to contact you for a long time

206
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,230
I told Team Leader Jeong of Yongcheonseo

207
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,690
Pancuronium was also detected in the third body.

208
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,230
No, but I feel like

209
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,950
I think it's the first time I've heard it

210
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,820
I said, 'It was detected in the previous body too.'

211
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,700
When I said that

212
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,330
How could you be so blubber blubber blubber?

213
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,920
Did Manager Seo omit it on purpose?

214
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,960
Why me?

215
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,460
I already handed over the results

216
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,550
You must have just glanced at it and passed it over.

217
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,390
No way

218
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,050
The detective in charge of that important thing

219
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,560
Maybe you didn't read it properly?

220
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,930
I don't know

221
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,810
I conveyed it properly

222
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,520
Even the rookie team leader made a mistake

223
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,980
Should I cover it?

224
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,070
Well, it's okay since it's resolved

225
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,700
I gave the drug test record to Mr. Chun the day before yesterday

226
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,780
It seemed like they were taking it all

227
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,910
is it so?

228
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,660
That's good, oh and

229
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,880
Have you heard that they are asking the temporary autopsy room in Yongcheonseo to be withdrawn?

230
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,380
Cheolsu? The culprit is still there

231
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,550
The police are catching the criminal.

232
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,050
He said that we had given everything we had to give, so that was enough.

233
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,100
The Nam Seung-hyeop case is also a bit of a headache

234
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,640
You also have to take responsibility for your own risks

235
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,980
Me?

236
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,310
so

237
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,900
This is my gift of comfort to you

238
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,440
Wow, what do you think? Isn't it pretty?

239
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,070
That flower

240
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,780
I don't like it

241
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,570
huh

242
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,830
If you keep looking at it, it becomes prettier

243
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,420
Oh right

244
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,090
While I was here, the director asked me to meet him.

245
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,630
Standby and wait

246
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,210
Well, is there anything bothering you that I don't know about?

247
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,290
Hey, team leader

248
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,710
yes?

249
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,880
Why are you so surprised?

250
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,890
Oh, come to think of it, you're acting really weird today.

251
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,810
No, I was just thinking about something else for a moment.

252
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,060
Hey, Team Leader Jeong! Hey!

253
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,270
Hey, this kid, hey bro

254
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,770
How have you been, kid?

255
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,360
Hey, senior, hello

256
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,610
Long time no see? Oh, you came with me, yes.

257
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,740
Hey, wait a minute, senior. What do you like?

258
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,950
Oh, it's cold, so you want something warm?

259
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,660
What do you like about warm things?

260
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,580
Let's go, follow me

261
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,080
Okay, I got it, kid.

262
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,870
I told you to contact me more often, this kid, Mr. Lee

263
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,250
I found a clue to the Yongcheon incident, senior.

264
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,290
We know this is a difficult request.

265
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,630
How frustrated must we have been that we even thought about provoking the US?

266
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,340
There is considerable circumstantial evidence to suggest a connection.

267
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,380
In a situation where there may be another victim

268
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,430
If you don't know, you won't know

269
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,470
Even though I know, I can't just pass it by, senior

270
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,180
I know what you mean

271
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,520
Oh, a chain of unsolved cases with no suspects

272
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,230
This is too risky

273
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,940
I have to give it to the kids after they raise their hands

274
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,810
Tsk, well

275
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,860
It's not easy due to the characteristics of the river.

276
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,820
It's a place where only elites with bright futures gather.

277
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,910
If you just tell them to defuse the bomb out of a sense of mission,

278
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,370
That's right, senior.

279
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,200
If the suspect is clear

280
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,330
I don't know if it was an incident that caused social outrage

281
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,460
In cases where there is a high probability of failure

282
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,790
Without any justification or benefit

283
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,960
Why is there no justification?

284
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,170
A photo of a minor was found on a dead body.

285
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,010
The source of our case

286
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,510
Could this be child abuse?

287
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,720
Do you have any direct evidence for that?

288
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,220
There isn't any, so let's gather our strength

289
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,800
I'm sorry, senior.

290
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,430
me too

291
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,310
I want to help you coolly

292
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,520
Oh no, oh no, no

293
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,190
It's actually harder to refuse

294
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,070
Rather, we are sorry

295
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,570
Don't be so sad

296
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,160
That's because I'm in a position where I have to convince my team members too.

297
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,070
senior

298
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,980
Brother, it's underwear.

299
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,900
Are you here? Are you here?

300
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,020
I put on some padding, bro.

301
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,400
Brother, how was your trip?

302
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,450
Is this a dud after all?

303
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,320
What is 'kwang'? 'kwang'?

304
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,910
It wasn't an easy task to begin with

305
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,950
What about the wooden door?

306
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,120
I worked hard

307
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,960
The result of the wooden box test is just a blister? Huh?

308
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,380
Come here

309
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,930
Oh, oh, oh, that dirty, dirty thing

310
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,390
Oh, no, I don't want to go to the hospital.

311
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,640
I'll give it to you, come here.

312
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,470
Oh, I don't like it

313
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,310
Hey, are you taking that to the hospital?

314
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,770
I think you should take a look at this.

315
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,850
What is it?

316
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,450
Well, you've probably heard it already.

317
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,700
Withdraw and return to the temporary autopsy room

318
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,000
No way

319
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,710
The Yongcheonseo incident was caused by Mr. Oh Min-ho

320
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,460
Can't you see that it's more of a mess here now?

321
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,210
They say the Nam Seung-hyeop case investigation committee will be convened soon.

322
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,340
Manager Seo will take charge of that and handle it.

323
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,930
Hey, look at the atmosphere

324
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,260
I think there will be a lot of pressure to request a re-examination.

325
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,310
To do this, we need to first understand why the specimen was discarded early.

326
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,730
I have to clarify

327
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,310
Did you also discard the specimen sample?

328
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,770
what?

329
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,150
Didn't you do it?

330
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,320
Hey, what kind of re-examination is this in this yard?

331
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,660
Just upload it now!

332
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,250
I can't post results that contradict the autopsy results.

333
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,920
From the perspective of Manager Seo,

334
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,670
I think I'm doing this now because I'm afraid they'll ask me to take responsibility later.

335
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,250
You're talking about responsibility

336
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,250
Don't worry about that problem.

337
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,550
I'll take full responsibility, okay?

338
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,550
You said you would take responsibility

339
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,640
Then you have to take responsibility

340
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,680
Hey, Seo Se-Hyeon

341
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,310
Can't you see what's going on right now?

342
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,430
The reason you are safe now is

343
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,810
Because I am protecting you

344
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,190
I'm talking about this

345
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,980
If I let go of these two hands that are holding you

346
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,900
You know what happens? You just

347
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,860
You're going to let it go anyway

348
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,160
What are you letting go of now?

349
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,200
You take care of the aftermath yourself.

350
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,040
Hey, Seo Se-hyeon, Seo Se

351
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,750
But where is it?

352
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,050
Oh, I, definitely

353
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,380
It doesn't look like a nice building.

354
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,800
There was no invoice?

355
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,720
yes

356
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,560
Me, team leader

357
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,730
This is an official document from the National Institute of Scientific Investigation.

358
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,360
They say the temporary autopsy room will be closed for now?

359
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,740
Please send me this file. Yes.

360
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,290
No, when the teacher died

361
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,380
You didn't even blink an eye

362
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,800
Does that make sense?

363
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,260
Sir, we're in big trouble!

364
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,510
The audit teams are rushing in now

365
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,300
They said they manipulated the drug results, but it's true

366
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,310
What are you doing now!

367
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,470
You can't enter now

368
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,810
Withdraw immediately

369
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,980
this

370
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,020
Put it on the road

371
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:50,610
There is suspicion that the emotional results of Manager Seo were manipulated

372
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,530
If the investigation results show no abnormalities, we will return all the items.

373
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,370
I would appreciate your cooperation.

374
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,120
What if nothing comes out?

375
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,290
How will you take responsibility then?

376
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,210
If you do this, it will be worse for the manager.

377
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,750
Since the Nam Seung-hyeop incident last time

378
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,290
Until this Yongcheon incident

379
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,210
We already have all the evidence we need.

380
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,170
This is just a procedure

381
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,760
Do you have everything?

382
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,430
Then, isn't there no need for this?

383
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,840
uh?

384
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,260
you

385
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,430
Did you also fabricate the evidence in our son's case?

386
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,440
You were our senior son.

387
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,310
How is that? How!

388
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,020
You know it

389
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,030
You know who killed our son!

390
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,150
Put this down!

391
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,320
You're saying this without even checking the facts

392
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,080
You'll regret it

393
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,660
Mr. Oh Min-ho

394
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,410
What, do you think I'm different?

395
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,630
why?

396
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,720
That good son

397
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,010
I guess he didn't say what he did.

398
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,730
Oh, it's a shame that something like that happened to you, Mr.

399
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,100
Stop blaming the poor people.

400
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,740
Bad year!

401
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,160
Say it again you piece of shit bitch!

402
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,870
Say it again!

403
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,790
Say it again, again!

404
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,410
Bad year!

405
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,500
You shouldn't do this

406
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,000
Say it again, bitch!

407
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,880
How is it? How is it? Bad

408
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,920
Bad year!

409
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,920
Minho! Minho!

410
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,010
Miss, that's the result

411
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,390
Why are you guys taking so long, tsk

412
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,680
Oh, oh

413
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,350
Yes, yes, are you out? Yes

414
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,440
'124 Jungang-ro 1-gil' Yes, yes, thank you.

415
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,400
Jungang-ro 1-gil, Jungang-ro 1-gil

416
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,150
Oh, haven't you been there recently, bro?

417
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,780
Why did you go?

418
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,450
Oh my, I've been wandering around so much that I'm all mixed up, really, shit

419
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,700
Kwon Hyung-jo?

420
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,330
That's right

421
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,080
Hey, contact the local police station in your area.

422
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,870
Go quickly. Yes, quickly.

423
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,670
Hyukgeun, let's go, yeah, yeah

424
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,550
Yes, yes, this is the Yongcheonseo strong team!

425
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,670
yes

426
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,220
What did the gratitude team get wrong?

427
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,400
There's no reason for the manager to do that.

428
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,200
Are you here?

429
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,460
Could you please avoid Mr. Chun's seat?

430
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,600
Are you hiding something from me?

431
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,060
Why all of a sudden?

432
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,230
If it's because of the temporary autopsy room withdrawal

433
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,240
Go talk to the manager.

434
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,040
Do you really have nothing to say to me?

435
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,580
Leave this alone

436
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,370
Pancuronium from corpse

437
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,920
Why did you hide it?

438
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,500
So now

439
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,590
Is that drug the reason you doubt me?

440
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,720
to be honest

441
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,760
What difference does it make if we know that pancuronium has been detected?

442
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,510
Could you have caught the culprit with that crude skill?

443
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,980
Then, let me ask you a few questions with my crude skills.

444
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,820
Really this incident

445
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,900
Does the manager have nothing to do with it?

446
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,780
Oh, teacher, you were the target too

447
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,490
The third body was also found in front of the manager's house.

448
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,700
That blue can that was in the manager's studio

449
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,990
Is it all a coincidence?

450
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,160
But why

451
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,790
Were you really that shocked when you saw the photos from the body?

452
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,750
That kind of enemy

453
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,710
There isn't any

454
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,720
Really Cheongunhang too

455
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,430
You don't even know the kid in the picture?

456
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,510
yes

457
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,720
I don't know

458
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,900
then

459
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,730
What is this?

460
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,940
Why did you come here?

461
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,450
I think you already have the answer to your question.

462
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,160
Just anything is fine

463
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,910
Can't you just be honest with me?

464
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,040
I

465
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,460
To prevent more victims from emerging

466
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,920
I believed in the manager's passion

467
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,470
Thank you for putting aside your work and coming down here to see the death of your colleague.

468
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,640
I respected the manager's sincerity

469
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,720
If that's what the manager has been saying so far,

470
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,180
Everyone believed

471
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,180
however

472
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,610
But now I don't know

473
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,440
Can I trust the manager?

474
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,200
then

475
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,820
No need to explain much.

476
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,580
You said you didn't believe me

477
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,870
But what else do you need to say?

478
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,290
What I mean is

479
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,000
I want you to tell me the truth so that I can believe it.

480
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,300
No matter what I say anyway

481
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,680
You won't believe me

482
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,470
Isn't it?

483
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,020
Go Eun-seo

484
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,400
Do you know who it is?

485
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,820
Please tell me

486
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,570
Doesn't the manager know?

487
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,920
Good luck catching the culprit

488
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,090
Never again

489
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,340
Let's not look
