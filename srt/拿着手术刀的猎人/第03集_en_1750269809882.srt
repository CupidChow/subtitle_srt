1
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,195
Twice across

2
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,239
Double vertical

3
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,913
Twice across

4
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,791
Double vertical

5
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,509
I can't get scolded by my dad

6
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,137
Don't leave handprints

7
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,848
Don't leave a trace

8
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,142
Not even a single fingerprint should remain

9
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:44,021
I have to clean it up before dad comes.

10
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,764
Oh, detective!

11
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,600
No, what is this, what is this, huh?

12
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,894
That's a tailor, right? Yes?

13
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,229
Oh, when will we be able to chew it well?

14
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,731
You look happy, Reporter Kim?

15
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,608
A person died, but are you happy?

16
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,652
Boy, are you excited?

17
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,945
There were a series of murders within a week.

18
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,239
Oh, okay, let's see you at the presentation

19
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,742
Here, there, people, get them all out of the alley right now.

20
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,118
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,412
Citizens' right to know must also be respected.

22
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,499
Do you see no risk of another victim?

23
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,625
Detective!

24
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,752
It's a little late. Who was the first discoverer?

25
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,298
Yes, there was no one around

26
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,509
Because I've been working alone all this time

27
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,469
Any additional information?

28
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,805
Hey

29
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,517
This time, it might be a bit difficult to verify your identity, right?

30
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,062
I cut off all the joints of this finger.

31
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,898
Did you get a statement?

32
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,900
Yes, but what else besides white cloth?

33
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,735
I don't think you saw anything in particular

34
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,362
He said there was no one walking around.

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,657
kid

36
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,199
You said plastic was detected yesterday?

37
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,827
Whew

38
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,870
What is that?

39
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,748
I collected some of the cleaning brushes sold on the market.

40
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,419
These are products that are widely used in ordinary households.

41
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,545
ah!

42
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,839
This one

43
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,430
What are the soil analysis results?

44
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,308
That's what Mr. Oh was doing

45
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,560
Let me check it out right now

46
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,396
Okay, tell Teacher Oh to do it himself.

47
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,443
Well, you haven't gone to work yet.

48
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,569
also?

49
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,739
Call me, quick

50
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,366
I did it but you didn't accept it

51
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,076
There is no callback

52
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,662
Manager Seo

53
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,123
The director is looking for you urgently

54
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,303
What happened?

55
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,888
Oh, that's it, just now

56
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,640
Dispatched after receiving a report of a body being found

57
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,351
Hey, did I tell you?

58
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,479
You answer

59
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,939
What do you mean, same offender?

60
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,357
Field investigation results

61
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,193
The previously discovered corpse and the method of the crime were very similar.

62
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,694
How can you be so sure?

63
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,279
This time, the thread was found

64
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,532
line?

65
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,574
yes

66
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,702
If there is this much similarity, there is a high possibility that it is the same person.

67
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,913
It might be a copycat

68
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,331
okay

69
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,708
We can't rule out the possibility that it's a copycat.

70
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,294
Even without that, I see it on SNS every day these days

71
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,629
Well, you're a tailor or something

72
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,006
He was even bragging while reenacting the crime.

73
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,093
It hasn't even been a week since the first body was discovered.

74
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,637
You're saying you learned this quickly in such a short period of time?

75
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,389
Hey, hey, Jeong Jeong-hyeon

76
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,474
Is this your first murder case?

77
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,102
Yes, that's right.

78
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,520
however

79
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,897
Because of that one thread, they're all the same criminals

80
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,649
Can I be so sure of this?

81
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,402
Okay, team leader

82
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,530
Well, this did come out, by any chance

83
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,326
Is this an autopsy warrant?

84
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,369
yes

85
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,038
We'll know for sure when the autopsy results come out.

86
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,249
Then I'll be back

87
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,792
Hey, hey, hey!

88
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,003
Oh, that kid

89
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,132
Oh, shit

90
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,679
Hey, hey, I'll give all the detectives a pass.

91
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,055
Find the stalker first, unconditionally

92
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,224
If there's no suspect, we're all screwed, really.

93
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,642
Okay, I understand.

94
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,688
No, but

95
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,899
Shouldn't one person follow the team leader?

96
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,483
Damn, this kid

97
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,652
Hey, get your stance right.

98
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,321
yes

99
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,825
Oh, did anything come out about the Yongcheon City incident?

100
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,952
Nothing special yet

101
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:51,870
okay?

102
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,247
Well, if you dig up to this point with Manager Seo's skills and it doesn't come out,

103
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,248
There probably isn't one

104
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,083
Then, the Yongcheon incident

105
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,170
Let's move on and finish it once the drug results come out

106
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,881
Hey, what happened to Mr. Oh Min-ho?

107
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,883
What, you said you didn't come out today?

108
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,551
yes

109
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,554
Oh my, you're even a team leader

110
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,931
You're just fighting with your subordinates

111
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,726
What the heck!

112
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,519
If I talk, only my mouth hurts

113
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,482
So are you just going to watch this happen?

114
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,941
Go home and see

115
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,818
Try calling the emergency contact number

116
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,322
Oh, so, anyway, shouldn't we take action?

117
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,157
Don't waste any more time

118
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,369
Take care of Mr. Oh Min-ho's case today, okay?

119
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,746
yes

120
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,125
I bought a voice because the connection was not working

121
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,008
Manager Seo

122
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,303
Another body has been found

123
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,472
Again?

124
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,974
Can you do an autopsy right away?

125
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,770
Oh, now

126
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,146
This time, the thread was found

127
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:41,396
I am revealing myself as much as I have revealed myself

128
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,814
I'm ready

129
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,677
Manager

130
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,640
Here, I think there's something in here too.

131
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,715
specimen plate

132
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,841
yes

133
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,062
Ribbon knot

134
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,077
Find out the identity first

135
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,161
yes

136
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,317
Does this look like a child's handprint?

137
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,404
Manager

138
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,481
How did it go?

139
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,108
My fingerprints came out

140
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,195
But there is no owner

141
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,114
Yes? What is that?

142
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,284
There is no suspect matching the fingerprints.

143
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,119
Are you sure you checked correctly?

144
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,621
Then I

145
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,706
Are you saying you made a mistake?

146
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,337
no

147
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,298
I was asking if that was possible.

148
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,969
I will re-examine, but the result will be the same.

149
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,389
Yes, I understand. Then what is the identity of the deceased?

150
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,724
It's confirmed

151
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,643
Who are you?

152
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,232
Oh Min-ho

153
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,526
This is my team member

154
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,371
Hey, grab it here, grab it

155
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,538
Is it too windy?

156
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,832
Ah, just pull it up and lift it up a bit!

157
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,626
Oh, I think that's about right. Oh, oh

158
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,253
Oh, be careful

159
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,838
Oh, wait a minute, first of all, first of all, yes?

160
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,298
Oh, I'll tie it here, then

161
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,469
Detective Park! Hey, bro!

162
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,513
Up, yes, what did you say?

163
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,598
Up here, it's crooked, this way

164
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,685
Oh, right, right, kid, a little more

165
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,604
Hey, hey, you've gone too far, just come down a little

166
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,440
Like this? Oh, oh, right, okay.

167
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,942
Okay, thanks for your hard work!

168
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,944
Go ahead, brother! Yes!

169
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,198
Oh, I have to upload it

170
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,666
Really?

171
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,085
Is this really Mr. Oh?

172
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,881
I guess they'll investigate?

173
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,175
I guess they'll do some background checks

174
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,136
Reference person

175
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,557
Everyone, please cooperate with the police as much as possible.

176
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,893
But you know, even if I get investigated

177
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,521
Keep quiet about Nam Seung-hyeop, okay?

178
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,564
Well, well, I don't know

179
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,524
That, uh, that was the first case Mr. Oh was in charge of.

180
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,735
It's obvious as day that he's going to start talking nonsense

181
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,695
Hurry up before it gets noisy

182
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,489
Let's wrap it up with Manager Seo's case and get rid of it.

183
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,784
Yes, then by today

184
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,536
Request a drug re-examination from the toxicology department

185
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,372
Hey, what kind of reexamination is this in this yard?

186
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,415
Just upload it now!

187
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,835
I can't post results that contradict the autopsy results.

188
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,629
Sir

189
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,881
From Manager Seo's perspective

190
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,508
I think I'm doing this now because I'm afraid they'll ask me to take responsibility later.

191
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,218
You're talking about responsibility

192
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,219
Don't worry about that problem.

193
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,013
I'll take full responsibility, okay?

194
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,599
I don't like it

195
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,059
It was an incident that came into my room

196
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,145
Oh, this is your first solo case.

197
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,855
Need to re-examine

198
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,649
okay?

199
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,610
Well, if that's what you think

200
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,320
good

201
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,530
Call Mr. Chun

202
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:25,573
yes

203
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,624
Hey, hey, Mr. Chun, you're here?

204
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,834
Did you call?

205
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,127
Oh, yeah

206
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,796
As of this time

207
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,216
Mr. Cheon is in charge of all the autopsy cases of Director Seo.

208
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,928
What are you doing now?

209
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,056
Why? You said you couldn't do what I told you to do?

210
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,267
Oh, and please send the payment directly to me.

211
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,353
Hey, boss

212
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,107
How can I, who am not even a forensic scientist,

213
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,025
No, I have a master's degree in anatomy.

214
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,778
After four years as an investigator, you should know most things, right?

215
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,198
Well, what about Mr. Chun's skills?

216
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,700
I'll pass on the complicated stuff to another team.

217
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:13,037
Let's try to do something simple by cooperating with external personnel.

218
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,956
I will actively support you

219
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,999
please

220
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,835
Do you really have to go this far?

221
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,004
'Good job, good job'

222
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,133
Do you think you've achieved anything because you're being praised here and there?

223
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,467
Don't get me wrong

224
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,095
There are many people in the world who can work besides you.

225
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,141
It's an emergency situation where even if everyone works together with one mind and one purpose, it won't be enough.

226
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,394
You're being so stubborn and ignorant, tsk

227
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,902
I, Manager Seo

228
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,446
We need to investigate the references

229
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,198
Where should I do it?

230
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,033
Should we do it here? Or what, the police station?

231
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,368
Over there, than that

232
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,954
Are you okay?

233
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,673
On the day of the incident

234
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,675
Mr. Oh Min-ho came down to the Yongcheon site

235
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,927
You went up together on the bus, right?

236
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:10,970
I saw the CCTV

237
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,806
It seemed like you were having a serious conversation about something.

238
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,266
What did you talk about?

239
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,312
I'm not sure, but I think it was about work

240
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,732
After we broke up, you went straight home?

241
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,317
no

242
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,031
I went to the hospital

243
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,157
Is this a hospital?

244
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,659
Where does it hurt?

245
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,497
Do I have to say that?

246
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,791
no

247
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,668
Oh, that's not it

248
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,546
At the estimated time of death of Mr. Oh Min-ho

249
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,924
All you have to do is prove that you were there.

250
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,886
I was there late, check it out

251
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,098
Then maybe

252
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,145
There was someone in the company who was not on good terms with Mr. Oh Min-ho.

253
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:04,065
Something strange happened around Mr. Oh Min-ho.

254
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,150
Do you know anything?

255
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,944
well

256
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,656
I don't know much about personal life

257
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,910
Yes, I understand.

258
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,165
So finally

259
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,210
I was wondering if you had any guesses about this.

260
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,962
Why would they dump the body in Yongcheon?

261
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,632
If you look at the estimated time of death, it is that time

262
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,843
Mr. Oh Min-ho was definitely in Seoul.

263
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,223
Dad, are you going to Yongcheon today?

264
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,474
Manager Seo?

265
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,353
I don't know

266
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,442
Don't be too upset

267
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,321
I will definitely catch the culprit.

268
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,798
Yes, sir

269
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,675
The victim is Mr. Oh of the National Forensic Service

270
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,051
Hey, are you sure?

271
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,221
I'm on my way out after the investigation of Director Seo's witness.

272
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,599
The surviving family members include my mother and older brother.

273
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,267
My mother collapsed as soon as she heard the news.

274
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,185
Come together first

275
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,353
We found the suspect

276
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,652
This is the CCTV of the parcel logistics warehouse where Lee Yeon-ju worked.

277
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,238
A delivery man who worked at the same time

278
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,824
Hey, hey, I was hovering around Ms. Lee Yeon-ju like that.

279
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,701
He said he was very stressed because of that.

280
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,328
Fruit tree analysis results

281
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,497
The stalking suspect we missed last time

282
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,458
It was confirmed that the impression was the same

283
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,084
And what's even more surprising is

284
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,087
Sentenced to 7 years for murder in 2008

285
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,714
I was released from prison 10 years ago.

286
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,840
okay?

287
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,176
Hey, what are you guys doing? I'm going to apply for an arrest warrant right away.

288
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,093
wait a minute

289
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,762
This is evidence of stalking.

290
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,306
Isn't this evidence of the murder that just occurred?

291
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,891
But it is too early to conclude that he is a suspect

292
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,017
so

293
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,187
Who do you think the culprit is?

294
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:08,856
that

295
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,316
I have to find it now

296
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,359
On what basis?

297
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:15,279
What, here, thread and a cleaning brush, something like that?

298
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:19,408
A kid who doesn't even know the culprit is always opposing, shit

299
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,160
Changjin, I'm applying for an arrest warrant

300
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,454
Then oh, what else!

301
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,332
I was already watching the CCTV mainly focusing on large vehicles.

302
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,292
The control vehicle number has already been secured.

303
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,919
Just check that and then issue a warrant.

304
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:31,921
There's not much left now

305
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,548
If you concentrate quickly, it won't take long.

306
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,258
What do you guys think?

307
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,803
uh?

308
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,807
I contacted Mr. Chun a little while ago anyway

309
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,891
You came in person?

310
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,476
Did you get anything?

311
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,019
yes

312
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,314
In the plastic wrap that wrapped Lee Yeon-ju's body

313
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,650
Soil containing sodium elements was detected

314
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,567
and

315
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,528
In the corpse

316
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,656
A large amount of pancuronium was detected.

317
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,248
It is a paralytic muscle relaxant used in poisoning.

318
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,375
In an instant, the body becomes paralyzed,

319
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,918
It's a quantity that can lead to death.

320
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,518
49…

321
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,627
492…

322
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,423
492…

323
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,970
'7492', found

324
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,555
Where, where! I found it

325
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,849
Oh, what, what is it? Oh, here, here

326
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,309
Here, here, here

327
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,269
Wait, let me see, let me see

328
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,606
4:26, 4:26

329
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,149
This is what we expected

330
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,026
When I abandoned the body and escaped through the intersection

331
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,694
That's pretty much the same as the estimated time, right?

332
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,409
This is Jeong Jeong-Hyeon from the strong team

333
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,871
Please call 72bar7492 for emergency vehicle inquiries

334
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,681
Twice horizontally, twice vertically

335
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,701
Are you there?

336
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,707
I see

337
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,333
Didn't this kid notice and run away?

338
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,585
Even if I jump out

339
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,296
Since his identity has already been identified, he probably couldn't have gone far.

340
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,674
First, let's search the house and secure evidence.

341
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,844
Come in, open it

342
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,480
Hey! Hey, you little shit!

343
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,484
I see

344
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:23,903
Hey, hey, Seokwoo, Seokwoo

345
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,571
Go back, go back. Yes, I understand.

346
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,865
Hey, Hyukgeun, Hyukgeun, break it, break it, break it

347
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,783
Mr. Lee

348
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,416
madam

349
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,752
Oh, hey, over there!

350
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,421
Hurry up and go! Oh, really, aren't you coming for work?

351
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,093
That kid

352
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,768
Hey, team leader! Hey

353
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,270
Hey, team leader, team leader, ah, ah

354
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,647
Bro, that kid fell off on his own!

355
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,440
Oh my gosh, really!

356
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,465
uh?

357
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:27,841
Team leader!

358
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,260
hey!

359
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,221
Hey, you little shit, kid, seriously

360
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,392
Hey, follow me, follow me

361
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,894
I see

362
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:26,608
Teacher Choi

363
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,318
Teacher Choi!

364
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,236
Yes, yes

365
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,030
Agricultural plastic covering the body

366
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,240
Please bring it to me so I can check my fingerprints.

367
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,742
But that vinyl

368
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,036
We've already investigated everything.

369
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,622
The area is so large that I'm afraid I might miss something

370
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:41,999
Break it all down into pieces

371
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,584
Well, that vinyl is fine.

372
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,378
Let's take a look at that tape that was stuck there.

373
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:12,780
Whether it's fingerprints or DNA

374
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,490
Please check everything

375
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,227
Oh my!

376
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,118
This kid, y'know

377
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,620
Get up, get up

378
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,622
Team leader, team leader, are you okay?

379
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,250
I see

380
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,002
Hey! Stay still, stay still.

381
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,963
Hold on tight, Mr. Lee

382
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,965
Hey, put it down

383
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:13,966
Put the fuck down

384
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,759
Come on, come on, oh my!

385
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,178
Hey, hey, stay still, stay still

386
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,602
I see

387
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,437
Stay still

388
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:29,648
This kid is going to die, Lee

389
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,650
You have the right to remain silent

390
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,527
All statements from now on

391
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,279
can be used against you

392
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,447
He can hire a lawyer

393
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,824
Are you aware of this fact?

394
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,035
Oh, I don't know, what the fuck, really

395
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,205
I realized

396
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:00,345
Oh, we said we would do it

397
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,430
this

398
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,864
I can't get scolded by my dad

399
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,034
Don't leave handprints

400
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,911
Don't leave a trace

401
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,538
Not even a single fingerprint should remain

402
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:30,918
I have to clean it up before dad comes.
