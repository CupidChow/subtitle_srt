00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,433
(Park Joo Hyun)

2
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,500
(Park Yong-woo)

3
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:33,467
(Jiang Xun)

4
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:55,033
(Hunter with a scalpel)

5
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:57,000
(The places, names, merchants, characters, groups, backgrounds, etc. in this drama are purely fictional and have nothing to do with reality)

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,100
(Child actors are accompanied by guardians when filming animal scenes, experts are present and animal protection regulations are followed)

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,500
I didn't kill him.

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,300
It's this woman, what else are you asking?

9
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,367
I see her almost every day.

10
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:09,333
The cat was disemboweled and its internal organs came out...

11
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,900
I was chilled to the bone

12
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,133
Auntie, did you see me killing the cat?

13
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:17,567
You come here to feed the cat all day long.

14
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:21,400
Someone who can make nearby stray cats let down their guard and approach them

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,567
Who else but you?

16
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:25,000
Adjust all monitors.

17
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,300
So interesting

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,433
What are you doing?

19
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:32,267
Look at this woman, she's so creepy.

20
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:33,700
Actually said it's interesting

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,400
Because people who hope stray cats die

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,133
It's ridiculous to accuse people who want to save stray cats

23
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,300
What

24
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,033
When did I wish the stray cat would die?

25
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:44,033
Didn't you ask me not to feed the stray cats and let them starve to death?

26
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:45,133
No, that's because...

27
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:46,767
Is there any evidence that I killed the cat?

28
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:48,600
That's not the case either.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,633
Because we have to go out after receiving a report

30
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:52,100
If there is no evidence, I can leave.

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,867
How can you leave?

32
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:57,000
Now that we have received the report, we should investigate it thoroughly.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,800
So we are here to investigate, right?

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,100
Are you talking to me loudly?

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,400
You yelled at me first

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,600
Where did I yell at you?

37
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,867
(Hunter with a scalpel)

38
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:12,400
(Episode 4)

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,267
It's Chief Rui.

40
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:46,433
We caught the suspect in the farmland case.

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,900
How did you catch it so quickly?

42
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,433
As you said, the criminals used a large vehicle.

43
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:53,300
It's a truck with a container.

44
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,433
Thank you so much

45
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,500
Thanks to your advice, we were able to find the criminal as quickly as possible.

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,967
Did he confess his crime?

47
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:03,400
not yet

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,067
So I would like to ask

49
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:08,700
We are interrogating the criminal. Are there any clues that can help?

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,933
Although the same line was found

51
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,533
But there is no other similarity with the case of Forensic Doctor Wu.

52
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,333
Compared to this...

53
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,067
Is that person... Team Leader?

54
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,500
I should get back to work.

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,933
I'll call you later

56
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:45,667
Is the eyewitness testimony correct?

57
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:48,333
OK, I understand. Please send me the recording immediately.

58
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,533
Team Leader Zheng

59
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,600
Rui Kechang

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,967
Where is the suspect?

61
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:59,400
In the interrogation room

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,167
But why are you here?

63
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,033
This is for you

64
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,767
Soil analysis results

65
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,600
I think you don't have time to answer the phone.

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,967
It may be used when interrogating criminals.

67
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,167
right

68
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,033
Thank you very much

69
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,333
(Only Exhibit 1 was tested positive for sodium)
Different from the soil at the crime scene

70
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,100
The soil on the plastic sheet was tested for sodium

71
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,167
This means that the murder site and the body dumping site are different.

72
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,333
Wait a moment

73
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,833
Qingyun Port

74
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,433
The suspect's warehouse is in Qingyun Port

75
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:35,233
The sodium content of salt is related to seawater.

76
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:38,233
What about confession? Did he admit his crime?

77
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,833
Not yet, but he can't deny it.

78
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,500
Three hours before the incident

79
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,433
The surveillance camera at the Sancha Road rice roll shop where Li Yuanzhu had been also captured him

80
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,900
Now analyzing whether it is the same person

81
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,500
But the clothes are very similar

82
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,600
Plus the witness just made a statement

83
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,533
Seems very credible

84
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,900
Can…

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,133
Can you show me your appearance?

86
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:17,500
What

87
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,433
The suspect's appearance

88
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,533
I'm curious about what kind of person he is.

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,433
This is a bit difficult...

90
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:26,600
Aren't we partners working together?

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,633
That's right.

92
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:29,833
However, according to regulations, it cannot be disclosed to outsiders

93
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,167
I'm the medical examiner in charge of this case.

94
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,833
A relative of the victim

95
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,900
You said I was an outsider.

96
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,600
I felt a little sad.

97
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,067
I did not mean that…

98
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:43,767
I put aside the other cases.

99
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,667
Come as soon as the test results come out

100
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,467
To solve this case.

101
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,867
Yes, I understand.

102
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:53,933
But this is not something I can decide alone.

103
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:57,067
You mean you don't believe me?

104
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll just let you take a look.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,400
don’t worry

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,433
I don't want to stay too long.

107
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
(Non-relevant persons are prohibited from entering the restricted area)

108
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,567
Are you okay?

109
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,833
fine

110
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,667
How many times do I have to say it?

111
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,567
This person is not me

112
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:45,867
are you sure

113
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:47,367
Lying would be perjury...

114
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,667
This container truck

115
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,867
This container truck is yours, right?

116
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:54,767
And this coat and bucket hat

117
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,267
It's similar to what you're wearing now.

118
00:07:57,267 --> 00:08:01,500
Yes, I did park here to deliver the goods.

119
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,100
But this person is not me

120
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,767
And yeah

121
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,533
What if they dress similarly?

122
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,267
I can't see his appearance clearly

123
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:12,567
You should provide solid evidence.

124
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:17,267
Someone saw you carrying the body out of the car.

125
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:18,567
Are you going to continue to deny?

126
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:19,500
Am I crazy?

127
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,933
Why use a car to transport the body? It's so dirty.

128
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:26,700
Wait a moment

129
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,967
That's what happened.

130
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,833
When I delivered the goods a while ago

131
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,967
Once, the carton was broken, so I used plastic wrap instead.

132
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:45,267
That's from Japan. The quality is super good.

133
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,667
The touch is exactly the same as a real woman

134
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:53,467
You obviously know what I'm talking about

135
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,567
It's a real inflatable doll.

136
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,133
You're still joking when you're about to die.

137
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:06,233
(Jang Hyuk-geun senior)

138
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,967
It's Zhang senior

139
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:13,800
The team leader just received a call from the support team.

140
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,333
Quan Hengchao's warehouse in Qingyun Port

141
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,400
They searched everywhere and found only life-size sex dolls

142
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,633
What to do

143
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,000
They said it wasn't me.

144
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:37,967
It's all your fault.

145
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,367
This is the biggest problem with the cops in South Korea

146
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:44,900
Is he possessed by a lazy ghost?

147
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,067
Just want to eat ready-made food

148
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:49,167
senior

149
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,867
Is this okay, police?

150
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:53,767
It's not 1988.

151
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,367
Now, all filmed.

152
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:56,433
Look at his atrocities

153
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,767
Five previous convictions for fraud and theft

154
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,333
How could you kill someone?

155
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,900
At most one wrongful death

156
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,300
You're just a shameless low-level criminal.

157
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,233
Killing is too hard for you.

158
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,033
Mostly after getting drunk

159
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:13,967
I accidentally did it while arguing with my friend, right?

160
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,533
What did you say

161
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,233
Killing people is not something that everyone can do.

162
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,600
Trash like you

163
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,500
I don't even have the courage to do it.

164
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,800
That's why he follows girls around.

165
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,233
Who followed

166
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,867
It was those women who seduced me first

167
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:34,700
Then what

168
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,300
She hates useless trash like you.

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,733
Are you so mad you want to kill her?

170
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,833
wrong

171
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:48,233
Your wife loves you to death

172
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,600
This bastard

173
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,967
You're dead, damn.

174
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:55,000
Stop it, bro...

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Don't be so impulsive.

176
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,000
(Longchuan Police Station)

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,867
Damn, I can't swallow this.

178
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
So what do you want to do?

179
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:25,000
What should I do?

180
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Kneel down

181
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,367
Kneel down for me

182
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:32,667
This bastard...

183
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,000
how

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,733
Do you want to punch me too?

185
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,467
Go ahead and fight.

186
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:40,067
If you dare, try it.

187
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,800
Just kneel down?

188
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,467
Let me think

189
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:47,933
Kneel down and see.

190
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,867
Big brother can't

191
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,733
What the hell are you doing?

192
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:59,733
The mistreatment you received during your arrest and interrogation

193
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,767
I am the person in charge of this case.

194
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:03,233
Formal apology to you

195
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:05,100
In addition, we made mistakes during the case handling process.

196
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,133
They will also take the initiative to report to their superiors and accept relevant punishments.

197
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:08,900
But among my team members

198
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:12,633
No one will kneel down to apologize to you

199
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:13,667
Yeah

200
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,867
All right

201
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,633
There's nothing we can do.

202
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:22,267
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth

203
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,533
Let me punch you back.

204
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll go easy on you, don't worry.

205
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:36,333
Don't go too far.

206
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,967
I'll catch you back soon.

207
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:40,233
Even if you didn't kill anyone, you did follow them.

208
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,833
Didn't you make eye contact with me in front of the apartment that day?

209
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,733
I remember it clearly

210
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,533
Detectives from Longchuan Police Station

211
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,600
In the absence of any evidence

212
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,533
Arresting innocent citizens and threatening them verbally

213
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,467
Violence against me

214
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,833
You said the detective beat you?

215
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,733
Yes, it was here that I was beaten by the criminal police

216
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,033
etc.

217
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:31,167
Please explain in detail what happened

218
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:35,500
I demand that the Longchuan Police Department formally apologize to me

219
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,267
And compensate me for my mental damage

220
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:40,233
Come and take a picture of my wound

221
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:44,133
I want everyone to know about this.

222
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:47,033
Hello, please arrange an emergency press conference today.

223
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:49,067
Solve this matter, you hear?

224
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,333
You mean today?

225
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,700
Didn't you see how big the commotion was out there?

226
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,567
You got into trouble, you should clean it up quickly, brat.

227
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,767
Section Chief

228
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:01,000
This is not Team Leader Zheng's fault.

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,267
Otherwise, whose fault is it?

230
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:05,033
Tell me whose fault it is

231
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:06,967
Am I wrong?

232
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,233
Because that guy told Changjin to kneel down...

233
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,767
So you want to take responsibility?

234
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:12,800
Section Chief

235
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,400
Okay, that's it.

236
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,033
Changzhen

237
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:19,533
You go to the press conference and then pack up and leave.

238
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:21,400
Okay, let's do it this way.

239
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,600
No, I'll hold a press conference.

240
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:31,633
good

241
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,533
Please explain it to me

242
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:36,667
Clean up this mess

243
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,167
yes

244
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:55,967
Section Chief

245
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:57,733
Just leave it there.

246
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,333
Don't you need to go to Longchuan?

247
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,800
I heard that there will be an emergency press conference soon.

248
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,200
It's about the suspect.

249
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,167
(Murder case of female college student in Yeonsan-eup, Yongcheon City)

250
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,633
(Emergency press conference information on Longchuan City murder case)

251
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:24,467
(First February 2025)

252
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:32,367
Team Leader

253
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,500
Please take a look at this

254
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,633
This is what Hee-gun and Seok-woo found.

255
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:40,167
It was the day when Chief Rui and Wu Minhao arrived in Longchuan

256
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:43,533
The surveillance camera footage of the passenger train they took

257
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,900
There is a man here

258
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:49,467
I've been watching them both.

259
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,533
We feel a bit suspicious

260
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:55,300
And the man in the rice roll shop's surveillance camera

261
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,367
He seems more similar to Kwon Hyung-jo than Kwon Hyung-jo

262
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,233
Of course, further investigation is needed to confirm

263
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:07,733
At least today's emergency press conference

264
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,533
If the reporter mentions serial killings

265
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:14,100
Can I also mention that we have a potential suspect?

266
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,267
OK

267
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,000
Mr. Quan Hengchao, who was mistaken for a suspect, claimed

268
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,067
The police used violence and conducted a high-pressure interrogation on him.

269
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,000
Is this true?

270
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,167
We admit that there were indeed negligence in the process of handling the case.

271
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,967
As the person in charge of this case, I must take full responsibility.

272
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:33,300
Once again, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the victim, Mr. Kwon Hyung-cho.

273
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,033
Expressing my deepest apologies

274
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,400
Two bodies have been found.

275
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,233
Is there a connection between the two cases?

276
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:48,733
The second case is still in the preliminary investigation stage and cannot be disclosed to the public for the time being.

277
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,133
The second victim

278
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:53,200
The same forensic investigator who was in charge of the first case

279
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,067
Are you sure the two cases are unrelated?

280
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,800
So far, no relevant information has been confirmed.

281
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,100
Have you identified a suspect in the dismemberment murder case?

282
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,967
not yet

283
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:05,000
Do you have any evidence to identify the suspect?

284
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,100
Yes

285
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,000
(Potential suspect… Is it the same person in the surveillance camera of the rice roll shop and the passenger transport?)

286
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,333
If the reporter mentions serial killings

287
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:14,867
Can I also mention that we have a potential suspect?

288
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:20,333
We have obtained important evidence and are conducting a search.

289
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,033
Can you reveal what the evidence is?

290
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,133
This part...

291
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,733
We are still searching and it is not convenient to explain clearly...

292
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:34,500
So you haven't found any definitive evidence yet?

293
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,800
Is it likely to end up being a cold case?

294
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,700
What is the main reason for the stagnation of search progress?

295
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,833
Please explain...

296
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:03,033
What exactly is the so-called important evidence?

297
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,800
It's a fingerprint

298
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,133
Fingerprint?

299
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,967
Physical evidence in the Longchuan female college student murder case

300
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:20,200
We found a new fingerprint

301
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:26,967
I am Seo Se-hyun, the head of the forensic medicine department at the Seoul Institute of Scientific Investigation.

302
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:29,267
The two bodies found this time

303
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:30,733
I was responsible for the autopsy.

304
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:34,600
(Fingerprints found in two murder cases)
Next, I will answer the questions about Guokesou.

305
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,167
Has the fingerprint I mentioned been used to identify the person?

306
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,267
That fingerprint is not complete.

307
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,700
It is very difficult to identify

308
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,933
More time needed

309
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,433
Newly discovered fingerprints

310
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:47,167
Is it the same fingerprint as the unidentified person in the dismemberment murder case?

311
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,233
right

312
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,367
Fingerprints found in two cases

313
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,700
Belongs to the same person

314
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,033
You mean

315
00:18:57,033 --> 00:19:00,333
The two recent murders in Longchuan...

316
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,567
That's right

317
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,200
This is a serial murder case.

318
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,767
Have you found out why the two victims were chosen as targets by the murderer?

319
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:17,733
Have you ever heard of the title "tailor"?

320
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:22,367
The thread found on the body, could the murderer be a medical practitioner?

321
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:24,767
The journalist who mentioned the tailor

322
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:26,367
Please don't say that again.

323
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:28,500
Don't speculate on the murderer's occupation.

324
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,433
This is the worst body I've ever done.

325
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:36,333
The first victim was a student studying for the police exam

326
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,067
The second victim

327
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,533
My colleague

328
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:43,333
So I implore you all

329
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,133
Don't use provocative words

330
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:48,133
Giving meaning to cruel crimes

331
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:52,700
The murderer is just an overly narcissistic person

332
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,833
Just ignorant and useless scum.

333
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,633
It broke after a while.

334
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:04,567
Broken

335
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,733
Shien

336
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,900
I need to prepare a birthday present.

337
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:23,367
Finally, we will send forensic doctors to Longchuan City

338
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:26,833
I hope to solve the case as soon as possible.

339
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,900
(The murderer is a "scumbag" who is trapped in twisted narcissism)

340
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,567
She is really crazy.

341
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,600
Are you crazy?

342
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:45,233
Please help me build a temporary autopsy center in Longchuan

343
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,800
you…

344
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,433
I will convene a disciplinary committee immediately.

345
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:51,533
The exchange is...

346
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:55,033
I will sign Nam Seung Hyup's drug test report.

347
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:58,333
What did you say?

348
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,900
I will achieve your desired conditions

349
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,100
Then I'll take that as your consent and hang up the phone.

350
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:07,267
Rui Kechang

351
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,700
Please stay

352
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:11,900
Is it true?

353
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,667
Did the same fingerprints really appear?

354
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:16,033
I just heard about it not long ago.

355
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,833
Because it seemed like I could help, I hurried over.

356
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,500
I shouldn't have bothered you.

357
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,500
No

358
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,533
We just had a headache. Thank you for helping us.

359
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,467
Thanks to you, I think you can help us with the search.

360
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:28,533
Yes, very good

361
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:30,633
Team Leader

362
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,867
Don't discuss anything with me.

363
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:35,967
Just say it's a serial murder case? Who agrees?

364
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:37,833
A forensic doctor should be like a forensic doctor

365
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,033
Just find the evidence and give it to us.

366
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,967
Why show up at someone else's press conference for no reason?

367
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,567
Make a mess of things.

368
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:47,467
And Zheng Zhengxian, why don't you stop her?

369
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm sorry... you shouldn't be angry with me

370
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,900
I should thank you

371
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,500
What

372
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,633
Please do not expect or believe what is said within the organization.

373
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:56,700
If you delay for a while, the case will subside on its own.

374
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,467
If we don’t catch the murderer now, a third...

375
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:01,933
The probability of not having the fourth or fifth corpse appear

376
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,767
It can be said that one hundred percent

377
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:05,700
What did you say?

378
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,767
What are you talking about?

379
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:12,667
This case will bring disaster to Longchuan Police Station

380
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:15,000
And this will be the chief police officer's career

381
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,633
A very big fallacy

382
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:20,300
Not Rui Shixian

383
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,167
Who do you think you are to threaten me?

384
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:24,733
I can…

385
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,167
Assisting Team Leader Zheng Zhengxian

386
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:29,267
Produced results for the Director

387
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,067
I will definitely...

388
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:33,300
Caught the murderer

389
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,300
therefore

390
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,567
Please give us a chance.

391
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,467
May I ask your name?

392
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:44,300
Hello

393
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,733
I am the leader of the Criminal Support Team, Kim Oh-kyung.

394
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,800
What

395
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,600
You said there was a dismembered body in the trash can?

396
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,033
Where is that

397
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:54,367
Please say

398
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:58,533
Are you saying that the body found this time is not your son?

399
00:22:58,533 --> 00:22:59,633
yes

400
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,800
yes

401
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,800
This kind of missing person report should be submitted to the local police station

402
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,000
The plenary session will now begin

403
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:10,967
The first two cases occurred in Longchuan

404
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:14,400
Will be investigated as a serial murder case

405
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,667
The clues we know now are...

406
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,467
Unidentified fingerprint home line

407
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:20,667
Bleach and brush

408
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,433
Just sodium

409
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:25,467
It’s hard to master these alone…

410
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:27,400
What does the murderer represent with these?

411
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,500
And what is the goal

412
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,900
What we can know is

413
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,633
The murderer has a fixed pattern of committing crimes

414
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:36,300
But what is special is that his way of disposing of the body is different

415
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,900
The first body found in a farm field is

416
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,267
But the body of the second case

417
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:43,900
(Victims of Seokjin-dong, Victims of Yeonsan Paradise)
The body was dismembered at the joints.

418
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:45,533
Why is it different?

419
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:49,800
And why should every finger that is cut off

420
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,600
Hide it back in the body?

421
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,867
These are things we must investigate clearly.

422
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,933
Although the places where the bodies were dumped were all open places

423
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:01,133
But there happened to be no surveillance cameras

424
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:03,267
So it may be that he lives in Longchuan

425
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:05,767
Or someone who knows Longchuan very well

426
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:08,400
The dismemberment was very delicate and clean

427
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,867
Look at him abandoning the body so generously

428
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,467
The murderer is likely a person with a sense of superiority.

429
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:15,533
A serial killer who loves to pursue power

430
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:18,233
The murderer is not easy to catch

431
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:20,500
And I am not a fragile, frivolous and emotional person.

432
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,767
Sometimes they even manipulate us.

433
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:27,767
(Longchuan City)

434
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,967
This case is a huge challenge for us.

435
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,500
Please remember

436
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,567
We must work together

437
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:35,933
And don't jump to conclusions

438
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:39,200
As long as you fall into the trap set by the murderer

439
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,467
We will never catch the murderer.

440
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:51,600
The murderer is just an overly narcissistic person

441
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,367
Just ignorant and useless scum.

442
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,500
What should I give her so she will like it?

443
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:23,133
Miss, the business is closed today.

444
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,600
Uncle, have you seen this?

445
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,600
I told you when I first saw it that this was hard to remove.

446
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,167
What nonsense

447
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,667
There was no dirt on it when I gave it to you

448
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,667
Is this uncle joking?

449
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:50,133
Are you trying to shift your fault to the customer?

450
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
No

451
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,200
Of course it's my fault

452
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,567
Okay, I'll dry clean it for you.

453
00:25:58,567 --> 00:25:59,900
But it's a little late today...

454
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,733
What else is dry cleaning?

455
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:03,700
You can't wear it at all, okay?

456
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,900
Just pay the money.

457
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,067
Probably compensate me...

458
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,867
(Note: about NT$20,000)
800,000 is enough

459
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
When I wake up tomorrow

460
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'll come over and help you with dry cleaning right away.

461
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,867
Can you compensate me?

462
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:26,967
good

463
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,400
Are you speaking half a word to me now?

464
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,833
I said I could compensate you.

465
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:37,400
But since it's in cash, I have to go over there to get it

466
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:45,933
No matter where you go, just pay quickly.

467
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:53,600
May I

468
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,267
I think it should be possible.

469
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,533
What are you doing now?

470
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,100
I told you to give me the money quickly

471
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,433
That's right

472
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:18,100
What size clothes do you wear?

473
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,300
that…

474
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,500
What are you doing now?

475
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,867
55?

476
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,367
The shoes should be size 24.

477
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:37,767
The clothes here

478
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:44,867
Most of them are abandoned

479
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,767
That's what clothes are like.

480
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,500
Easy to be forgotten

481
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,667
Do you know why this is happening?

482
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:55,900
Because there are too many

483
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,367
Just like people

484
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:16,833
Where are you going?

485
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:20,700
I found some clothes for you.

486
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,867
No…

487
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:26,933
No

488
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:30,000
Just pretend it never happened.

489
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:01,133
How about it

490
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:04,767
Very beautiful, right?

491
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:15,633
(laundry)

492
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:19,667
