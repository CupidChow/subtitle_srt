1
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,200
Twice across

2
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,240
Double vertical

3
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,910
Twice across

4
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,790
Double vertical

5
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,510
I can't get scolded by my dad

6
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,140
Don't leave handprints

7
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,850
Don't leave a trace

8
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,140
Not even a single fingerprint should remain

9
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,020
I have to clean it up before dad comes.

10
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,760
Oh, detective!

11
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,600
No, what is this, what is this, huh?

12
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,890
That's a tailor, right? Yes?

13
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,230
Oh, when will we be able to chew it well?

14
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,730
You look happy, Reporter Kim?

15
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,610
A person died, but are you happy?

16
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,650
Boy, are you excited?

17
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,950
There were a series of murders within a week.

18
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,240
Oh, okay, let's see you at the presentation

19
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,740
Here, there, people, get them all out of the alley right now.

20
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,120
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,410
Citizens' right to know must also be respected.

22
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Do you see no risk of another victim?

23
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,630
Detective!

24
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,750
It's a little late. Who was the first discoverer?

25
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,300
Yes, there was no one around

26
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,510
Because I've been working alone all this time

27
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,470
Any additional information?

28
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,810
Hey

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,520
This time, it might be a bit difficult to verify your identity, right?

30
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,060
I cut off all the joints of this finger.

31
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,900
Did you get a statement?

32
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,900
Yes, but what else besides white cloth?

33
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,740
I don't think you saw anything in particular

34
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,360
He said there was no one walking around.

35
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,660
kid

36
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,200
You said plastic was detected yesterday?

37
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,830
Whew

38
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,870
What is that?

39
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,750
I collected some of the cleaning brushes sold on the market.

40
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,420
These are products that are widely used in ordinary households.

41
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,550
ah!

42
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,840
This one

43
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,430
What are the soil analysis results?

44
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,310
That's what Mr. Oh was doing

45
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,560
Let me check it out right now

46
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,400
Okay, tell Teacher Oh to do it himself.

47
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,440
Well, you haven't gone to work yet.

48
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,570
also?

49
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,740
Call me, quick

50
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,370
I did it but you didn't accept it

51
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,080
There is no callback

52
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,660
Manager Seo

53
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,120
The director is looking for you urgently

54
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,300
What happened?

55
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,890
Oh, that's it, just now

56
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,640
Dispatched after receiving a report of a body being found

57
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,350
Hey, did I tell you?

58
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,480
You answer

59
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,940
What do you mean, same offender?

60
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,360
Field investigation results

61
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,190
The previously discovered corpse and the method of the crime were very similar.

62
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,690
How can you be so sure?

63
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,280
This time, the thread was found

64
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,530
line?

65
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,570
yes

66
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,700
If there is this much similarity, there is a high possibility that it is the same person.

67
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,910
It might be a copycat

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,330
okay

69
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,710
We can't rule out the possibility that it's a copycat.

70
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,290
Even without that, I see it on SNS every day these days

71
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,630
Well, you're a tailor or something

72
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,010
He was even bragging while reenacting the crime.

73
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,090
It hasn't even been a week since the first body was discovered.

74
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,640
You're saying you learned this quickly in such a short period of time?

75
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,390
Hey, hey, Jeong Jeong-hyeon

76
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,470
Is this your first murder case?

77
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,100
Yes, that's right.

78
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,520
however

79
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,900
Because of that one thread, they're all the same criminals

80
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,650
Can I be so sure of this?

81
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,400
Okay, team leader

82
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,530
Well, this did come out, by any chance

83
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,330
Is this an autopsy warrant?

84
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,370
yes

85
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,040
We'll know for sure when the autopsy results come out.

86
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,250
Then I'll be back

87
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,790
Hey, hey, hey!

88
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, that kid

89
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,130
Oh, shit

90
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,680
Hey, hey, I'll give all the detectives a pass.

91
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,060
Find the stalker first, unconditionally

92
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,220
If there's no suspect, we're all screwed, really.

93
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,640
Okay, I understand.

94
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,690
No, but

95
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,900
Shouldn't one person follow the team leader?

96
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,480
Damn, this kid

97
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,650
Hey, get your stance right.

98
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,320
yes

99
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,830
Oh, did anything come out about the Yongcheon City incident?

100
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,950
Nothing special yet

101
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,870
okay?

102
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,250
Well, if you dig up to this point with Manager Seo's skills and it doesn't come out,

103
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,250
There probably isn't one

104
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,080
Then, the Yongcheon incident

105
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,170
Let's move on and finish it once the drug results come out

106
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,880
Hey, what happened to Mr. Oh Min-ho?

107
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,880
What, you said you didn't come out today?

108
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,550
yes

109
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,550
Oh my, you're even a team leader

110
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,930
You're just fighting with your subordinates

111
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,730
What the heck!

112
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,520
If I talk, only my mouth hurts

113
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,480
So are you just going to watch this happen?

114
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,940
Go home and see

115
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,820
Try calling the emergency contact number

116
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,320
Oh, so, anyway, shouldn't we take action?

117
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,160
Don't waste any more time

118
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,370
Take care of Mr. Oh Min-ho's case today, okay?

119
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,750
yes

120
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,130
I bought a voice because the connection was not working

121
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,010
Manager Seo

122
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,300
Another body has been found

123
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,470
Again?

124
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,970
Can you do an autopsy right away?

125
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,770
Oh, now

126
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,150
This time, the thread was found

127
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,400
I am revealing myself as much as I have revealed myself

128
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,810
I'm ready

129
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,680
Manager

130
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,640
Here, I think there's something in here too.

131
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,720
specimen plate

132
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,840
yes

133
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,060
Ribbon knot

134
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,080
Find out the identity first

135
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
yes

136
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,320
Does this look like a child's handprint?

137
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,400
Manager

138
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,480
How did it go?

139
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,110
My fingerprints came out

140
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,200
But there is no owner

141
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,110
Yes? What is that?

142
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,280
There is no suspect matching the fingerprints.

143
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,120
Are you sure you checked correctly?

144
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,620
Then I

145
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,710
Are you saying you made a mistake?

146
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
no

147
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,300
I was asking if that was possible.

148
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,970
I will re-examine, but the result will be the same.

149
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,390
Yes, I understand. Then what is the identity of the deceased?

150
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,720
It's confirmed

151
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,640
Who are you?

152
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,230
Oh Min-ho

153
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,530
This is my team member

154
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,370
Hey, grab it here, grab it

155
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,540
Is it too windy?

156
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,830
Ah, just pull it up and lift it up a bit!

157
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,630
Oh, I think that's about right. Oh, oh

158
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,250
Oh, be careful

159
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,840
Oh, wait a minute, first of all, first of all, yes?

160
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,300
Oh, I'll tie it here, then

161
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,470
Detective Park! Hey, bro!

162
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,510
Up, yes, what did you say?

163
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Up here, it's crooked, this way

164
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,690
Oh, right, right, kid, a little more

165
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,600
Hey, hey, you've gone too far, just come down a little

166
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,440
Like this? Oh, oh, right, okay.

167
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,940
Okay, thanks for your hard work!

168
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,940
Go ahead, brother! Yes!

169
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,200
Oh, I have to upload it

170
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,670
Really?

171
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,090
Is this really Mr. Oh?

172
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,880
I guess they'll investigate?

173
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,180
I guess they'll do some background checks

174
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,140
Reference person

175
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,560
Everyone, please cooperate with the police as much as possible.

176
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,890
But you know, even if I get investigated

177
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,520
Keep quiet about Nam Seung-hyeop, okay?

178
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,560
Well, well, I don't know

179
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,520
That, uh, that was the first case Mr. Oh was in charge of.

180
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,740
It's obvious as day that he's going to start talking nonsense

181
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,700
Hurry up before it gets noisy

182
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,490
Let's wrap it up with Manager Seo's case and get rid of it.

183
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,780
Yes, then by today

184
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,540
Request a drug re-examination from the toxicology department

185
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,370
Hey, what kind of reexamination is this in this yard?

186
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,420
Just upload it now!

187
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,840
I can't post results that contradict the autopsy results.

188
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,630
Sir

189
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,880
From Manager Seo's perspective

190
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,510
I think I'm doing this now because I'm afraid they'll ask me to take responsibility later.

191
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,220
You're talking about responsibility

192
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,220
Don't worry about that problem.

193
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,010
I'll take full responsibility, okay?

194
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,600
I don't like it

195
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,060
It was an incident that came into my room

196
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,150
Oh, this is your first solo case.

197
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,860
Need to re-examine

198
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,650
okay?

199
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,610
Well, if that's what you think

200
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,320
good

201
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,530
Call Mr. Chun

202
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,570
yes

203
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,620
Hey, hey, Mr. Chun, you're here?

204
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,830
Did you call?

205
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,130
Oh, yeah

206
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,800
As of this time

207
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,220
Mr. Cheon is in charge of all the autopsy cases of Director Seo.

208
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,930
What are you doing now?

209
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,060
Why? You said you couldn't do what I told you to do?

210
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,270
Oh, and please send the payment directly to me.

211
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,350
Hey, boss

212
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,110
How can I, who am not even a forensic scientist,

213
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,030
No, I have a master's degree in anatomy.

214
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,780
After four years as an investigator, you should know most things, right?

215
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,200
Well, what about Mr. Chun's skills?

216
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,700
I'll pass on the complicated stuff to another team.

217
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,040
Let's try to do something simple by cooperating with external personnel.

218
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,960
I will actively support you

219
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,000
please

220
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,840
Do you really have to go this far?

221
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,000
'Good job, good job'

222
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,130
Do you think you've achieved anything because you're being praised here and there?

223
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,470
Don't get me wrong

224
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,100
There are many people in the world who can work besides you.

225
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,140
It's an emergency situation where even if everyone works together with one mind and one purpose, it won't be enough.

226
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,390
You're being so stubborn and ignorant, tsk

227
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,900
I, Manager Seo

228
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,450
We need to investigate the references

229
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,200
Where should I do it?

230
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,030
Should we do it here? Or what, the police station?

231
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,370
Over there, than that

232
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,950
Are you okay?

233
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,670
On the day of the incident

234
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,680
Mr. Oh Min-ho came down to the Yongcheon site

235
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,930
You went up together on the bus, right?

236
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,970
I saw the CCTV

237
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,810
It seemed like you were having a serious conversation about something.

238
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,270
What did you talk about?

239
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,310
I'm not sure, but I think it was about work

240
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,730
After we broke up, you went straight home?

241
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,320
no

242
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,030
I went to the hospital

243
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,160
Is this a hospital?

244
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,660
Where does it hurt?

245
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,500
Do I have to say that?

246
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,790
no

247
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,670
Oh, that's not it

248
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,550
At the estimated time of death of Mr. Oh Min-ho

249
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,920
All you have to do is prove that you were there.

250
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,890
I was there late, check it out

251
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,100
Then maybe

252
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,150
There was someone in the company who was not on good terms with Mr. Oh Min-ho.

253
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,070
Something strange happened around Mr. Oh Min-ho.

254
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,150
Do you know anything?

255
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,940
well

256
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,660
I don't know much about personal life

257
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,910
Yes, I understand.

258
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,170
So finally

259
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,210
I was wondering if you had any guesses about this.

260
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,960
Why would they dump the body in Yongcheon?

261
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,630
If you look at the estimated time of death, it is that time

262
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,840
Mr. Oh Min-ho was definitely in Seoul.

263
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,220
Dad, are you going to Yongcheon today?

264
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,470
Manager Seo?

265
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,350
I don't know

266
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,440
Don't be too upset

267
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,320
I will definitely catch the culprit.

268
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,800
Yes, sir

269
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,680
The victim is Mr. Oh of the National Forensic Service

270
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,050
Hey, are you sure?

271
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,220
I'm on my way out after the investigation of Director Seo's witness.

272
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,600
The surviving family members include my mother and older brother.

273
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,270
My mother collapsed as soon as she heard the news.

274
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,190
Come together first

275
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,350
We found the suspect

276
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,650
This is the CCTV of the parcel logistics warehouse where Lee Yeon-ju worked.

277
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,240
A delivery man who worked at the same time

278
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,820
Hey, hey, I was hovering around Ms. Lee Yeon-ju like that.

279
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,700
He said he was very stressed because of that.

280
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,330
Fruit tree analysis results

281
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,500
The stalking suspect we missed last time

282
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,460
It was confirmed that the impression was the same

283
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,080
And what's even more surprising is

284
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,090
Sentenced to 7 years for murder in 2008

285
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,710
I was released from prison 10 years ago.

286
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,840
okay?

287
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,180
Hey, what are you guys doing? I'm going to apply for an arrest warrant right away.

288
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,090
wait a minute

289
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,760
This is evidence of stalking.

290
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,310
Isn't this evidence of the murder that just occurred?

291
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,890
But it is too early to conclude that he is a suspect

292
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,020
so

293
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,190
Who do you think the culprit is?

294
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,860
that

295
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,320
I have to find it now

296
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,360
On what basis?

297
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,280
What, here, thread and a cleaning brush, something like that?

298
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,410
A kid who doesn't even know the culprit is always opposing, shit

299
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,160
Changjin, I'm applying for an arrest warrant

300
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,450
Then oh, what else!

301
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,330
I was already watching the CCTV mainly focusing on large vehicles.

302
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,290
The control vehicle number has already been secured.

303
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,920
Just check that and then issue a warrant.

304
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,920
There's not much left now

305
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,550
If you concentrate quickly, it won't take long.

306
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,260
What do you guys think?

307
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,800
uh?

308
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,810
I contacted Mr. Chun a little while ago anyway

309
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,890
You came in person?

310
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,480
Did you get anything?

311
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,020
yes

312
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,310
In the plastic wrap that wrapped Lee Yeon-ju's body

313
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,650
Soil containing sodium elements was detected

314
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,570
and

315
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,530
In the corpse

316
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,660
A large amount of pancuronium was detected.

317
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,250
It is a paralytic muscle relaxant used in poisoning.

318
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,380
In an instant, the body becomes paralyzed,

319
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,920
It's a quantity that can lead to death.

320
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,520
49…

321
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,630
492…

322
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,420
492…

323
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,970
'7492', found

324
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,560
Where, where! I found it

325
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,850
Oh, what, what is it? Oh, here, here

326
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,310
Here, here, here

327
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,270
Wait, let me see, let me see

328
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,610
4:26, 4:26

329
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,150
This is what we expected

330
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,030
When I abandoned the body and escaped through the intersection

331
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,690
That's pretty much the same as the estimated time, right?

332
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,410
This is Jeong Jeong-Hyeon from the strong team

333
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,870
Please call 72bar7492 for emergency vehicle inquiries

334
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,680
Twice horizontally, twice vertically

335
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,700
Are you there?

336
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,710
I see

337
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,330
Didn't this kid notice and run away?

338
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,590
Even if I jump out

339
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,300
Since his identity has already been identified, he probably couldn't have gone far.

340
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,670
First, let's search the house and secure evidence.

341
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,840
Come in, open it

342
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,480
Hey! Hey, you little shit!

343
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,480
I see

344
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,900
Hey, hey, Seokwoo, Seokwoo

345
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,570
Go back, go back. Yes, I understand.

346
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,870
Hey, Hyukgeun, Hyukgeun, break it, break it, break it

347
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,780
Mr. Lee

348
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,420
madam

349
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,750
Oh, hey, over there!

350
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,420
Hurry up and go! Oh, really, aren't you coming for work?

351
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,090
That kid

352
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,770
Hey, team leader! Hey

353
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,270
Hey, team leader, team leader, ah, ah

354
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,650
Bro, that kid fell off on his own!

355
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,440
Oh my gosh, really!

356
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,470
uh?

357
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:13,840
Team leader!

358
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,260
hey!

359
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,220
Hey, you little shit, kid, seriously

360
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,390
Hey, follow me, follow me

361
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,890
I see

362
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,610
Teacher Choi

363
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,320
Teacher Choi!

364
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,240
Yes, yes

365
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,030
Agricultural plastic covering the body

366
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,240
Please bring it to me so I can check my fingerprints.

367
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,740
But that vinyl

368
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,040
We've already investigated everything.

369
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,620
The area is so large that I'm afraid I might miss something

370
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,000
Break it all down into pieces

371
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,580
Well, that vinyl is fine.

372
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,380
Let's take a look at that tape that was stuck there.

373
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,780
Whether it's fingerprints or DNA

374
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,490
Please check everything

375
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,230
Oh my!

376
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,120
This kid, y'know

377
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,620
Get up, get up

378
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,620
Team leader, team leader, are you okay?

379
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,250
I see

380
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,000
Hey! Stay still, stay still.

381
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,960
Hold on tight, Mr. Lee

382
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,970
Hey, put it down

383
00:26:59,050 --> 00:26:59,970
Put the fuck down

384
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,760
Come on, come on, oh my!

385
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,180
Hey, hey, stay still, stay still

386
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,600
I see

387
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,440
Stay still

388
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,650
This kid is going to die, Lee

389
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,650
You have the right to remain silent

390
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,530
All statements from now on

391
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,280
can be used against you

392
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,450
He can hire a lawyer

393
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,820
Are you aware of this fact?

394
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,040
Oh, I don't know, what the fuck, really

395
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,210
I realized

396
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,350
Oh, we said we would do it

397
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,430
this

398
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,860
I can't get scolded by my dad

399
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,030
Don't leave handprints

400
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,910
Don't leave a trace

401
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,540
Not even a single fingerprint should remain

402
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,920
I have to clean it up before dad comes.
