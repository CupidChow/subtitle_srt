00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,430
(Park Joo Hyun)

2
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,500
(Park Yong-woo)

3
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,470
(Jiang Xun)

4
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,030
(Hunter with a scalpel)

5
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,000
(The places, names, merchants, characters, groups, backgrounds, etc. in this drama are purely fictional and have nothing to do with reality)

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,100
(Child actors are accompanied by guardians when filming animal scenes, experts are present and animal protection regulations are followed)

7
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,500
I didn't kill him.

8
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,300
It's this woman, what else are you asking?

9
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,370
I see her almost every day.

10
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,330
The cat was disemboweled and its internal organs came out...

11
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,900
I was chilled to the bone

12
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,130
Auntie, did you see me killing the cat?

13
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,570
You come here to feed the cat all day long.

14
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,400
Someone who can make nearby stray cats let down their guard and approach them

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,570
Who else but you?

16
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,000
Adjust all monitors.

17
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,300
So interesting

18
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,430
What are you doing?

19
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,270
Look at this woman, she's so creepy.

20
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,700
Actually said it's interesting

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,400
Because people who hope stray cats die

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,133
It's ridiculous to accuse people who want to save stray cats

23
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,300
What

24
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,033
When did I wish the stray cat would die?

25
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,030
Didn't you ask me not to feed the stray cats and let them starve to death?

26
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,130
No, that's because...

27
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,770
Is there any evidence that I killed the cat?

28
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,600
That's not the case either.

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,630
Because we have to go out after receiving a report

30
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,100
If there is no evidence, I can leave.

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,870
How can you leave?

32
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,000
Now that we have received the report, we should investigate it thoroughly.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,800
So we are here to investigate, right?

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,100
Are you talking to me loudly?

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,400
You yelled at me first

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,600
Where did I yell at you?

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,870
(Hunter with a scalpel)

38
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,400
(Episode 4)

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,270
It's Chief Rui.

40
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,430
We caught the suspect in the farmland case.

41
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,900
How did you catch it so quickly?

42
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,430
As you said, the criminals used a large vehicle.

43
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,300
It's a truck with a container.

44
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,430
Thank you so much

45
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,500
Thanks to your advice, we were able to find the criminal as quickly as possible.

46
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,970
Did he confess his crime?

47
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,400
not yet

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,070
So I would like to ask

49
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,700
We are interrogating the criminal. Are there any clues that can help?

50
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,930
Although the same line was found

51
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,530
But there is no other similarity with the case of Forensic Doctor Wu.

52
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,330
Compared to this...

53
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,070
Is that person... Team Leader?

54
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,500
I should get back to work.

55
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,930
I'll call you later

56
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,670
Is the eyewitness testimony correct?

57
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,330
OK, I understand. Please send me the recording immediately.

58
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,530
Team Leader Zheng

59
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,600
Rui Kechang

60
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,970
Where is the suspect?

61
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,400
In the interrogation room

62
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,170
But why are you here?

63
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,030
This is for you

64
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,770
Soil analysis results

65
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,600
I think you don't have time to answer the phone.

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,970
It may be used when interrogating criminals.

67
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,170
right

68
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,030
Thank you very much

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,330
(Only Exhibit 1 was tested positive for sodium)
Different from the soil at the crime scene

70
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,100
The soil on the plastic sheet was tested for sodium

71
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,170
This means that the murder site and the body dumping site are different.

72
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,330
Wait a moment

73
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,830
Qingyun Port

74
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,430
The suspect's warehouse is in Qingyun Port

75
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,230
The sodium content of salt is related to seawater.

76
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,230
What about confession? Did he admit his crime?

77
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,830
Not yet, but he can't deny it.

78
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,500
Three hours before the incident

79
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,430
The surveillance camera at the Sancha Road rice roll shop where Li Yuanzhu had been also captured him

80
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,900
Now analyzing whether it is the same person

81
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,500
But the clothes are very similar

82
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,600
Plus the witness just made a statement

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,530
Seems very credible

84
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,900
Can…

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,130
Can you show me your appearance?

86
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,500
What

87
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,430
The suspect's appearance

88
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,530
I'm curious about what kind of person he is.

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,430
This is a bit difficult...

90
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,600
Aren't we partners working together?

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,630
That's right.

92
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,830
However, according to regulations, it cannot be disclosed to outsiders

93
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,170
I'm the medical examiner in charge of this case.

94
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,830
A relative of the victim

95
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,900
You said I was an outsider.

96
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,600
I felt a little sad.

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,070
I did not mean that…

98
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,770
I put aside the other cases.

99
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,670
Come as soon as the test results come out

100
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,470
To solve this case.

101
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,870
Yes, I understand.

102
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,930
But this is not something I can decide alone.

103
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,070
You mean you don't believe me?

104
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll just let you take a look.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
don’t worry

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,430
I don't want to stay too long.

107
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
(Non-relevant persons are prohibited from entering the restricted area)

108
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,570
Are you okay?

109
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,830
fine

110
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,670
How many times do I have to say it?

111
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,570
This person is not me

112
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,870
are you sure

113
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,370
Lying would be perjury...

114
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,670
This container truck

115
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,870
This container truck is yours, right?

116
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,770
And this coat and bucket hat

117
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,270
It's similar to what you're wearing now.

118
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,500
Yes, I did park here to deliver the goods.

119
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,100
But this person is not me

120
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,770
And yeah

121
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,530
What if they dress similarly?

122
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,270
I can't see his appearance clearly

123
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,570
You should provide solid evidence.

124
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,270
Someone saw you carrying the body out of the car.

125
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,570
Are you going to continue to deny?

126
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,500
Am I crazy?

127
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,930
Why use a car to transport the body? It's so dirty.

128
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,700
Wait a moment

129
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,970
That's what happened.

130
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,830
When I delivered the goods a while ago

131
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,970
Once, the carton was broken, so I used plastic wrap instead.

132
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,270
That's from Japan. The quality is super good.

133
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,670
The touch is exactly the same as a real woman

134
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,470
You obviously know what I'm talking about

135
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,570
It's a real inflatable doll.

136
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,130
You're still joking when you're about to die.

137
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,230
(Jang Hyuk-geun senior)

138
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,970
It's Zhang senior

139
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,800
The team leader just received a call from the support team.

140
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,330
Quan Hengchao's warehouse in Qingyun Port

141
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,400
They searched everywhere and found only life-size sex dolls

142
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,630
What to do

143
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,000
They said it wasn't me.

144
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,970
It's all your fault.

145
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,370
This is the biggest problem with the cops in South Korea

146
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,900
Is he possessed by a lazy ghost?

147
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,070
Just want to eat ready-made food

148
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,170
senior

149
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,870
Is this okay, police?

150
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,770
It's not 1988.

151
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,370
Now, all filmed.

152
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,430
Look at his atrocities

153
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,770
Five previous convictions for fraud and theft

154
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,330
How could you kill someone?

155
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,900
At most one wrongful death

156
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,300
You're just a shameless low-level criminal.

157
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,230
Killing is too hard for you.

158
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,030
Mostly after getting drunk

159
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,970
I accidentally did it while arguing with my friend, right?

160
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,530
What did you say

161
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,230
Killing people is not something that everyone can do.

162
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,600
Trash like you

163
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,500
I don't even have the courage to do it.

164
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,800
That's why he follows girls around.

165
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,230
Who followed

166
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,870
It was those women who seduced me first

167
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,700
Then what

168
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,300
She hates useless trash like you.

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,730
Are you so mad you want to kill her?

170
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,830
wrong

171
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,230
Your wife loves you to death

172
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,600
This bastard

173
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,970
You're dead, damn.

174
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,000
Stop it, bro...

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,400
Don't be so impulsive.

176
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,000
(Longchuan Police Station)

177
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,870
Damn, I can't swallow this.

178
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
So what do you want to do?

179
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,000
What should I do?

180
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Kneel down

181
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,370
Kneel down for me

182
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,670
This bastard...

183
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,000
how

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,730
Do you want to punch me too?

185
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,470
Go ahead and fight.

186
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,070
If you dare, try it.

187
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,800
Just kneel down?

188
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,470
Let me think

189
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,930
Kneel down and see.

190
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,870
Big brother can't

191
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,730
What the hell are you doing?

192
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,730
The mistreatment you received during your arrest and interrogation

193
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,770
I am the person in charge of this case.

194
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,230
Formal apology to you

195
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,100
In addition, we made mistakes during the case handling process.

196
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,130
They will also take the initiative to report to their superiors and accept relevant punishments.

197
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,900
But among my team members

198
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,630
No one will kneel down to apologize to you

199
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,670
Yeah

200
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,870
All right

201
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,630
There's nothing we can do.

202
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,270
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth

203
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,530
Let me punch you back.

204
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll go easy on you, don't worry.

205
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,330
Don't go too far.

206
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,970
I'll catch you back soon.

207
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,230
Even if you didn't kill anyone, you did follow them.

208
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,830
Didn't you make eye contact with me in front of the apartment that day?

209
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,730
I remember it clearly

210
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,530
Detectives from Longchuan Police Station

211
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,600
In the absence of any evidence

212
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,530
Arresting innocent citizens and threatening them verbally

213
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,470
Violence against me

214
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,830
You said the detective beat you?

215
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,730
Yes, it was here that I was beaten by the criminal police

216
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,030
etc.

217
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,170
Please explain in detail what happened

218
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,500
I demand that the Longchuan Police Department formally apologize to me

219
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,270
And compensate me for my mental damage

220
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,230
Come and take a picture of my wound

221
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,130
I want everyone to know about this.

222
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,030
Hello, please arrange an emergency press conference today.

223
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,070
Solve this matter, you hear?

224
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,330
You mean today?

225
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,700
Didn't you see how big the commotion was out there?

226
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,570
You got into trouble, you should clean it up quickly, brat.

227
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,770
Section Chief

228
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,000
This is not Team Leader Zheng's fault.

229
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,270
Otherwise, whose fault is it?

230
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,030
Tell me whose fault it is

231
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,970
Am I wrong?

232
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,230
Because that guy told Changjin to kneel down...

233
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,770
So you want to take responsibility?

234
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,800
Section Chief

235
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,400
Okay, that's it.

236
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,030
Changzhen

237
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,530
You go to the press conference and then pack up and leave.

238
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,400
Okay, let's do it this way.

239
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,600
No, I'll hold a press conference.

240
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,630
good

241
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,530
Please explain it to me

242
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,670
Clean up this mess

243
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,170
yes

244
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,970
Section Chief

245
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,730
Just leave it there.

246
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,330
Don't you need to go to Longchuan?

247
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,800
I heard that there will be an emergency press conference soon.

248
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,200
It's about the suspect.

249
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,170
(Murder case of female college student in Yeonsan-eup, Yongcheon City)

250
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,630
(Emergency press conference information on Longchuan City murder case)

251
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,470
(First February 2025)

252
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,370
Team Leader

253
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,500
Please take a look at this

254
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,630
This is what Hee-gun and Seok-woo found.

255
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,170
It was the day when Chief Rui and Wu Minhao arrived in Longchuan

256
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,530
The surveillance camera footage of the passenger train they took

257
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,900
There is a man here

258
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,470
I've been watching them both.

259
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,530
We feel a bit suspicious

260
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:16,300
And the man in the rice roll shop's surveillance camera

261
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,370
He seems more similar to Kwon Hyung-jo than Kwon Hyung-jo

262
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,230
Of course, further investigation is needed to confirm

263
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,730
At least today's emergency press conference

264
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,530
If the reporter mentions serial killings

265
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:35,100
Can I also mention that we have a potential suspect?

266
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,270
OK

267
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,000
Mr. Quan Hengchao, who was mistaken for a suspect, claimed

268
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,070
The police used violence and conducted a high-pressure interrogation on him.

269
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,000
Is this true?

270
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,170
We admit that there were indeed negligence in the process of handling the case.

271
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,970
As the person in charge of this case, I must take full responsibility.

272
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,300
Once again, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the victim, Mr. Kwon Hyung-cho.

273
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,030
Expressing my deepest apologies

274
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,400
Two bodies have been found.

275
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,230
Is there a connection between the two cases?

276
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,730
The second case is still in the preliminary investigation stage and cannot be disclosed to the public for the time being.

277
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,130
The second victim

278
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,200
The same forensic investigator who was in charge of the first case

279
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,070
Are you sure the two cases are unrelated?

280
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,800
So far, no relevant information has been confirmed.

281
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,100
Have you identified a suspect in the dismemberment murder case?

282
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,970
not yet

283
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,000
Do you have any evidence to identify the suspect?

284
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,100
Yes

285
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,000
(Potential suspect… Is it the same person in the surveillance camera of the rice roll shop and the passenger transport?)

286
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,330
If the reporter mentions serial killings

287
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,870
Can I also mention that we have a potential suspect?

288
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,330
We have obtained important evidence and are conducting a search.

289
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,030
Can you reveal what the evidence is?

290
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,130
This part...

291
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,730
We are still searching and it is not convenient to explain clearly...

292
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,500
So you haven't found any definitive evidence yet?

293
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,800
Is it likely to end up being a cold case?

294
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,700
What is the main reason for the stagnation of search progress?

295
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,830
Please explain...

296
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,030
What exactly is the so-called important evidence?

297
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,800
It's a fingerprint

298
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,130
Fingerprint?

299
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,970
Physical evidence in the Longchuan female college student murder case

300
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,200
We found a new fingerprint

301
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,970
I am Seo Se-hyun, the head of the forensic medicine department at the Seoul Institute of Scientific Investigation.

302
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,270
The two bodies found this time

303
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,730
I was responsible for the autopsy.

304
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,600
(Fingerprints found in two murder cases)
Next, I will answer the questions about Guokesou.

305
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,170
Has the fingerprint I mentioned been used to identify the person?

306
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,270
That fingerprint is not complete.

307
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,700
It is very difficult to identify

308
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,930
More time needed

309
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,430
Newly discovered fingerprints

310
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,170
Is it the same fingerprint as the unidentified person in the dismemberment murder case?

311
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,230
right

312
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,370
Fingerprints found in two cases

313
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,700
Belongs to the same person

314
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,030
You mean

315
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,330
The two recent murders in Longchuan...

316
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,570
That's right

317
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,200
This is a serial murder case.

318
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,770
Have you found out why the two victims were chosen as targets by the murderer?

319
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,730
Have you ever heard of the title "tailor"?

320
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,370
The thread found on the body, could the murderer be a medical practitioner?

321
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,770
The journalist who mentioned the tailor

322
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,370
Please don't say that again.

323
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,500
Don't speculate on the murderer's occupation.

324
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,430
This is the worst body I've ever done.

325
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,330
The first victim was a student studying for the police exam

326
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,070
The second victim

327
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,530
My colleague

328
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,330
So I implore you all

329
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,130
Don't use provocative words

330
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,130
Giving meaning to cruel crimes

331
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,700
The murderer is just an overly narcissistic person

332
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,830
Just ignorant and useless scum.

333
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,630
It broke after a while.

334
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,570
Broken

335
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,730
Shien

336
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,900
I need to prepare a birthday present.

337
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,370
Finally, we will send forensic doctors to Longchuan City

338
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,830
I hope to solve the case as soon as possible.

339
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,900
(The murderer is a "scumbag" who is trapped in twisted narcissism)

340
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,570
She is really crazy.

341
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,600
Are you crazy?

342
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,230
Please help me build a temporary autopsy center in Longchuan

343
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,800
you…

344
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,430
I will convene a disciplinary committee immediately.

345
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,530
The exchange is...

346
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,030
I will sign Nam Seung Hyup's drug test report.

347
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,330
What did you say?

348
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,900
I will achieve your desired conditions

349
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,100
Then I'll take that as your consent and hang up the phone.

350
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,270
Rui Kechang

351
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,700
Please stay

352
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,900
Is it true?

353
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,670
Did the same fingerprints really appear?

354
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,030
I just heard about it not long ago.

355
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,830
Because it seemed like I could help, I hurried over.

356
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,500
I shouldn't have bothered you.

357
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,500
No

358
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,530
We just had a headache. Thank you for helping us.

359
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,470
Thanks to you, I think you can help us with the search.

360
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,530
Yes, very good

361
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,630
Team Leader

362
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,870
Don't discuss anything with me.

363
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,970
Just say it's a serial murder case? Who agrees?

364
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,830
A forensic doctor should be like a forensic doctor

365
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,030
Just find the evidence and give it to us.

366
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,970
Why show up at someone else's press conference for no reason?

367
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,570
Make a mess of things.

368
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,470
And Zheng Zhengxian, why don't you stop her?

369
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,200
I'm sorry... you shouldn't be angry with me

370
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,900
I should thank you

371
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,500
What

372
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,630
Please do not expect or believe what is said within the organization.

373
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,700
If you delay for a while, the case will subside on its own.

374
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,470
If we don’t catch the murderer now, a third...

375
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,930
The probability of not having the fourth or fifth corpse appear

376
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,770
It can be said that one hundred percent

377
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,700
What did you say?

378
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,770
What are you talking about?

379
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,670
This case will bring disaster to Longchuan Police Station

380
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,000
And this will be the chief police officer's career

381
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,630
A very big fallacy

382
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,300
Not Rui Shixian

383
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,170
Who do you think you are to threaten me?

384
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,730
I can…

385
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,170
Assisting Team Leader Zheng Zhengxian

386
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,270
Produced results for the Director

387
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,070
I will definitely...

388
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,300
Caught the murderer

389
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,300
therefore

390
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,570
Please give us a chance.

391
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,470
May I ask your name?

392
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,300
Hello

393
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,730
I am the leader of the Criminal Support Team, Kim Oh-kyung.

394
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,800
What

395
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,600
You said there was a dismembered body in the trash can?

396
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,030
Where is that

397
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,370
Please say

398
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:19,530
Are you saying that the body found this time is not your son?

399
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,630
yes

400
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,800
yes

401
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,800
This kind of missing person report should be submitted to the local police station

402
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,000
The plenary session will now begin

403
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,970
The first two cases occurred in Longchuan

404
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,400
Will be investigated as a serial murder case

405
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,670
The clues we know now are...

406
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,470
Unidentified fingerprint home line

407
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,670
Bleach and brush

408
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,430
Just sodium

409
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,470
It’s hard to master these alone…

410
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,400
What does the murderer represent with these?

411
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,500
And what is the goal

412
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,900
What we can know is

413
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,630
The murderer has a fixed pattern of committing crimes

414
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,300
But what is special is that his way of disposing of the body is different

415
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,900
The first body found in a farm field is

416
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,270
But the body of the second case

417
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,900
(Victims of Seokjin-dong, Victims of Yeonsan Paradise)
The body was dismembered at the joints.

418
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,530
Why is it different?

419
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,800
And why should every finger that is cut off

420
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,600
Hide it back in the body?

421
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,870
These are things we must investigate clearly.

422
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,930
Although the places where the bodies were dumped were all open places

423
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,130
But there happened to be no surveillance cameras

424
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,270
So it may be that he lives in Longchuan

425
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,770
Or someone who knows Longchuan very well

426
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,400
The dismemberment was very delicate and clean

427
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,870
Look at him abandoning the body so generously

428
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,470
The murderer is likely a person with a sense of superiority.

429
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,530
A serial killer who loves to pursue power

430
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,230
The murderer is not easy to catch

431
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,500
And I am not a fragile, frivolous and emotional person.

432
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,770
Sometimes they even manipulate us.

433
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,770
(Longchuan City)

434
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,970
This case is a huge challenge for us.

435
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,500
Please remember

436
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,570
We must work together

437
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,930
And don't jump to conclusions

438
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,200
As long as you fall into the trap set by the murderer

439
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,470
We will never catch the murderer.

440
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,600
The murderer is just an overly narcissistic person

441
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,370
Just ignorant and useless scum.

442
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,500
What should I give her so she will like it?

443
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,130
Miss, the business is closed today.

444
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,600
Uncle, have you seen this?

445
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,600
I told you when I first saw it that this was hard to remove.

446
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,170
What nonsense

447
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,670
There was no dirt on it when I gave it to you

448
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,670
Is this uncle joking?

449
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,130
Are you trying to shift your fault to the customer?

450
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,000
No

451
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,200
Of course it's my fault

452
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,570
Okay, I'll dry clean it for you.

453
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,900
But it's a little late today...

454
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,730
What else is dry cleaning?

455
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,700
You can't wear it at all, okay?

456
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,900
Just pay the money.

457
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,070
Probably compensate me...

458
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,870
(Note: about NT$20,000)
800,000 is enough

459
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
When I wake up tomorrow

460
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'll come over and help you with dry cleaning right away.

461
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,870
Can you compensate me?

462
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,970
good

463
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,400
Are you speaking half a word to me now?

464
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,830
I said I could compensate you.

465
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,400
But since it's in cash, I have to go over there to get it

466
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,930
No matter where you go, just pay quickly.

467
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,600
May I

468
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,270
I think it should be possible.

469
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,530
What are you doing now?

470
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,100
I told you to give me the money quickly

471
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,430
That's right

472
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,100
What size clothes do you wear?

473
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,300
that…

474
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,500
What are you doing now?

475
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,870
55?

476
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,370
The shoes should be size 24.

477
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:58,770
The clothes here

478
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,870
Most of them are abandoned

479
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,770
That's what clothes are like.

480
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,500
Easy to be forgotten

481
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,670
Do you know why this is happening?

482
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,900
Because there are too many

483
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,370
Just like people

484
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,830
Where are you going?

485
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,700
I found some clothes for you.

486
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,870
No…

487
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,930
No

488
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,000
Just pretend it never happened.

489
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,130
How about it

490
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,770
Very beautiful, right?

491
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,630
(laundry)

492
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,670
