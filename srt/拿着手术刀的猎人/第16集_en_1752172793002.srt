00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,440
(Park Joo Hyun)

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,710
(Park Yong-woo)

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,410
(Kang Hoon)

4
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,060
(Hunter with a scalpel)

5
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,890
(The names of the places and characters in this drama
The background setting is purely fictional and has nothing to do with reality)

6
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,020
(Child actors are accompanied by their guardians during filming
Animal scenes have experts on site and follow animal protection regulations)

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,240
elder sister

8
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,710
(Yin Shien)

9
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,310
Awesome, that's it.

10
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,840
After that, clasp your hands together like this.

11
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,410
Close your eyes

12
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,980
Say "goodbye" in your heart

13
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,480
goodbye

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,480
goodbye

15
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:15,240
(Hunter with a scalpel)

16
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,040
(Final)

17
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,210
hateful

18
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,510
This is a simple autopsy room.

19
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,510
Even the equipment is so complete

20
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,580
Please ask the scientific search team to come and collect evidence immediately

21
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,840
OK, I know.

22
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,510
Shien

23
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,380
dad…

24
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,480
Dad loves you so much

25
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,640
You found it successfully.

26
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,540
Have you been waiting for a long time?

27
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,210
This place hasn't changed at all.

28
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,140
Probably there.

29
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,610
Where we buried Zhenmei

30
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,840
right

31
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,110
We found Yin Tiaojun's container truck.

32
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,540
But Shien isn't here.

33
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,710
Help!

34
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,040
Please help me

35
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,980
That's not just any watch.

36
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,080
When you need it

37
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,310
A special watch that can help you

38
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,880
you…

39
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,910
Kill Shien?

40
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,480
What's important to her?

41
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,240
Why is the sea breeze still so cold?

42
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,840
Let's go. Dad has prepared the boat.

43
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,280
Let’s start over

44
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,010
Why should I go with you?

45
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,440
It's all your fault. There are police everywhere now.

46
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,940
You shouldn't blame me, you should blame yourself

47
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,640
What about you?

48
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,380
Are you different from me?

49
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,240
You think you can say a few words on TV?

50
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,110
People will trust and understand you.

51
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,780
Is it that easy?

52
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,280
When you poke the doll open and dig out the cotton

53
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,040
When mending

54
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,740
Who is by your side?

55
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,040
That stinky detective?

56
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,180
Still that demented old woman

57
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,610
It's me

58
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,510
just me

59
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,540
Stay by your side

60
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,640
You are special

61
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,040
You are different from others

62
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,280
Only dad can understand your uniqueness

63
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,380
Only Dad can truly love you

64
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,240
Who else will stay with you?

65
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,280
in the end…

66
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,740
I'm the only one

67
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,240
Do you understand?

68
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,540
Love?

69
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,740
Not only that

70
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,540
You are in pain

71
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,410
Have you tracked down Chief Rui's location?

72
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,310
It is currently confirmed that Chief Rui has left the Wuzhen toll station

73
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,280
During this period, reports were received

74
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,840
A smuggling boat owner was killed near Wuzhen

75
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,740
The estimated time of death was one hour ago

76
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,210
From the recording of the call on the ship owner's mobile phone

77
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,080
Yin Diaojun has reserved two seats

78
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,810
We have requested support from the nearby coast guard.

79
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,040
It seems that he has been

80
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,210
I don't plan to take Shien away.

81
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,640
It is very likely that

82
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,840
If the child is not in the truck

83
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,810
Probably abandoned somewhere nearby.

84
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,140
Let the team members do the search first and come to us immediately.

85
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,980
I have to go

86
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,680
If I don't go, I'll never find the evidence.

87
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,380
Shien's body is nowhere to be found.

88
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,440
Team Leader Zheng, are you listening to me?

89
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,540
There is a big button on the side of the watch

90
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,710
Long press and a red button will appear

91
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,940
Then someone will come to rescue you.

92
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,610
(Message sent)

93
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,910
Please help me

94
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,410
Please help me

95
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,910
Hello, Team Leader Zheng

96
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,810
Wait a minute

97
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,380
(Please help me with Rui Shixian's message)
Why don't you use the watch I gave you?

98
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,880
But I gave it to the child

99
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,110
But that kid looks a lot like me.

100
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,010
I don't know if she will ask for help.

101
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,410
(Please help me with Rui Shixian's message)

102
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,040
Team Leader

103
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,140
We found Shien's location.

104
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,140
I'll go find that kid, Chief Rui, I'll leave it to you guys.

105
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,280
OK

106
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,410
Let's go

107
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,480
(High Alert Drugs)

108
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,180
If I had done this sooner

109
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,080
Sister Enshu

110
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,040
And Shien wouldn't have died.

111
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,340
Stop kidding, give it to me

112
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,710
dad

113
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,540
Goodbye

114
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,780
Hello

115
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,640
Shien

116
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,140
Hello

117
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,800
Hi Shien...

118
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,680
Let's not meet again.

119
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,090
no

120
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,880
Shien…

121
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,510
Shien

122
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,680
Shien, where are you?

123
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,340
(Message sent)

124
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,480
Shien…

125
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,380
Shien

126
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,840
Shien

127
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,680
Yinshienshien, where are you?

128
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,110
Where the hell is she?

129
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,740
Shien

130
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,440
Shien, can you hear me?

131
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,240
Shien

132
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,410
Yin Shien...

133
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,610
Shien

134
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,910
senior

135
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,810
senior

136
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,740
She moved

137
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,280
The child is still moving

138
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,480
Shien

139
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,210
Can you hear your uncle's voice?

140
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,580
Uncle is a friend of Sister Shixian

141
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,980
Do you know Sister Rui Shixian?

142
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,610
Sister Shixian, please let me save you.

143
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,340
So you can't fall asleep

144
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,480
You wouldn't think

145
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,710
I will die before you.

146
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,780
don’t worry

147
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,380
I'm not someone stupid enough to give a lethal dose.

148
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,140
I still have a lot of things to do

149
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,080
Start Now

150
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,540
I will follow your instructions.

151
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,680
Cut open your belly

152
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,310
Then take out the internal organs.

153
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,140
Then the eyeball tongue

154
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,040
Finally, peel off the skin

155
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,340
This is the order, right?

156
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,910
Can you hear what I say?

157
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,440
Rui Shixian

158
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,340
Rui Shixian can't

159
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,340
Rui Shixian

160
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,410
Shien is fine

161
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,580
Team Leader Zheng found her

162
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,610
Please calm down

163
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,710
Shien is still alive

164
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,110
Thank you for not killing Shien

165
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,510
If something good happens someday

166
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,410
I will hold Shien's hand and go to the prison to see you

167
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:05,280
Because this is the most painful thing for Dad.

168
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,380
I got a muscle relaxant.

169
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,880
Not life-threatening

170
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,340
"My Open Wounds"

171
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:49,610
"It broke me down again"

172
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,780
"Come to me darling"

173
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:00,040
"Now you are in my dreams"

174
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,910
"You know that I can't wait any more"

175
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,210
"Those torn and broken"

176
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:14,540
"Fragments of nostalgic memories"

177
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:20,940
"Keep coming to me Make me cry"

178
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,540
In the past 24 days, it has attracted national attention

179
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,680
The Longchuan serial murder case, also known as the Tailor case

180
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,510
Suspects Rui Shixian and Yin Diao were finally arrested

181
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,310
After a physical conflict with Rui Shixian, Yin Diaojun

182
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,980
He was found at the scene with serious injuries

183
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,040
Rui Shixian was immediately rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment

184
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,880
The victim in this case

185
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,840
10-year-old girl held hostage by Yin Tiaojun

186
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Everyone was deceived. They have been rescued by the police and sent to the hospital.

187
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,310
She is the real killer.

188
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,810
She has harmed President Cui twice.

189
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:00,980
She framed President Choi for all the crimes.

190
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,080
I'd like to see you again

191
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,840
So happy

192
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,080
Why didn't you tell us?

193
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,210
Yin Diao has left a message for you

194
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,080
Why go find him yourself?

195
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,680
We can obviously discuss and solve it together.

196
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,280
After seeing Shien's uniform, I made up my mind.

197
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,810
I must end this myself.

198
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,180
so

199
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,180
Do you really want to kill him...

200
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,840
right

201
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,110
I intend to die with him.

202
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,910
This time

203
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,210
I really want to end it all

204
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,080
Where is Shien?

205
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,980
Is she okay?

206
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,910
fine

207
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,610
She recovered quickly.

208
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,310
Good appetite too

209
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,240
After searching the container truck

210
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,240
We have confirmed that all Longchuan cases were committed by Yin Tiaojun

211
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,840
But you search for fake reports in the National Science Foundation

212
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,580
And the case of Kwon Hyung-cho

213
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,380
and leaving the hospital without permission during the period of hospitalization

214
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,480
These must be examined according to law

215
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,580
There is also a charge of attempted murder.

216
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,710
The situation at that time can be fully explained as self-defense...

217
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,140
even so

218
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,710
The fact that I once wanted to kill him...

219
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,810
It won't disappear.

220
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,880
Don't worry too much

221
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,940
It will be handled appropriately

222
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,310
Thank you, Team Leader

223
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,610
I know it's because you understand me.

224
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,310
In order to conduct investigation without detention

225
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,240
It's nothing

226
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,580
Someone recommended a good lawyer who could help at the trial.

227
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,810
Wait a moment

228
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,540
My daughter is here

229
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:58,680
mom

230
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,480
Why is it so difficult to see you?

231
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,640
Are you busy?

232
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,510
There are many wounds on the face

233
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,980
What's wrong

234
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,980
What happened?

235
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,840
It's fine

236
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,940
Everything will be fine

237
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,010
My daughter...

238
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,980
So kind

239
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
Damn it.

240
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,780
You guys are going this way

241
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,010
Hello

242
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,280
Dead Cop

243
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,510
OK

244
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,810
hateful

245
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,410
Damn

246
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,980
Don't come over here

247
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,080
I told you I would catch you.

248
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,880
I sent the thief here.

249
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,980
elder brother

250
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,740
What's going on?

251
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,040
What's going on

252
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,680
Arrested on the spot for theft

253
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,940
The stolen goods were also recovered.

254
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,510
The next investigation will be handed over to the major crime unit.

255
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,240
It's you again, Kwon Hyung-jo

256
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,810
You really are...

257
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,480
You are such a real person

258
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,380
Please be gentle.

259
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,010
What are you doing here, little brat?

260
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,710
Don't act fast

261
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,480
This uniform suits you very well.

262
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,380
How is your time at the police station?

263
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,510
Hello, Jung Jung Hyun

264
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:53,910
Shouldn't the theft be transferred to the Criminal Division? Why send it to the Serious Crime Unit?

265
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,140
Why are you doing this?

266
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,610
Take this opportunity to see the Section Chief.

267
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,780
Now they beat people up.

268
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,380
What on earth did you learn outside? How did you become like this?

269
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,680
They actually pushed me, I feel like I've learned well.

270
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,280
Is it a good thing to learn to push people?

271
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,640
Any good news?

272
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,310
You seem to be in a good mood.

273
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,610
certainly

274
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,710
Good news

275
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,240
Um

276
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,510
This one fits

277
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,580
That one was too big.

278
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,340
I might grow taller next year.

279
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,240
Just wear what fits you now.

280
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,740
No, I like the one just now

281
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,310
Shien

282
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,440
uncle

283
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,310
What happened

284
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,540
She looks miserable.

285
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,610
It's not obvious that you will grow taller soon.

286
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,580
But my sister always asks me to buy something that fits me.

287
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,610
Hey, you won't grow any longer.

288
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,340
How do you know?

289
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,640
There are three famous brands, right?

290
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,510
Are three brand names really enough?

291
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,310
Well, that's enough.

292
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,310
(Rui Shien)

293
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,340
Look

294
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,610
How am I

295
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,510
It suits you very well. It's very beautiful.

296
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,840
Please, she just said she likes the other one which is a size bigger.

297
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,110
Please help me check out.

298
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,210
good

299
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,940
let me see

300
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,540
Do you like it?

301
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,810
Um

302
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,080
9108 meeting

303
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,340
Sister Enshu, I'm here

304
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,780
I came too late.

305
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,340
sorry

306
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,080
Thank you

307
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,880
(Thanks to all the viewers who watched "Hunter with a Scalpel")

308
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,480
(Praise the outstanding acting skills of the late actress Jiang Mingzhu and keep it in mind forever)
