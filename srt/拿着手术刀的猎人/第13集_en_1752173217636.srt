1
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,620
what's this?

2
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,550
Eunseo, why are you here instead of sleeping?

3
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,510
dad

4
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,050
As people live

5
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,350
This kind of thing shouldn't happen

6
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,070
The patient has a wound on the left abdomen and back.

7
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,660
The bleeding is severe. How is your condition?

8
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,910
He said he was barely able to maintain BP while giving volume in the ambulance.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,750
Are you going to go right in? I will go right in.

10
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,290
Did you call all the other teachers? Yes.

11
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,920
There is no guardian here? Here

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,500
What happened? Oh, yeah

13
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,800
The woman was severely beaten and her fingers were cut off.

14
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,710
The man appears to have been stabbed twice

15
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,180
I just got here, is that okay?

16
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,140
I guess we'll have to see

17
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,100
I don't know about the woman, but it's hard to guarantee the man's condition.

18
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,100
yes?

19
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,560
What happened? Team Leader Jeong is the victim, but who is the culprit?

20
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,560
Taking the child who was at the scene hostage

21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,610
ran away

22
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,940
Missed it again?

23
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,530
'Again'? Hey, did you just say 'again'?

24
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,400
Why are you speaking informally? Oh, isn't that right?

25
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,120
Isn't this the second time you've missed the scene while acting alone?

26
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,370
Solo action?

27
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,240
Hey, you fucking kid

28
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,870
What were you doing then?

29
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,040
What did you do to make this happen?

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,540
What are you doing now, then!

31
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,670
Let's talk about it, let's talk about it!

32
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,920
Oh my, oh my, oh my, sir!

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,500
Team leader Jeong made it like that

34
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,760
It was Choi Min-guk

35
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,640
With Team Leader Jeong

36
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,810
My senior

37
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,020
When I said that I wanted to investigate Choi Min-guk

38
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,060
What did you say then?

39
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,320
I wish you had moved with me then

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,860
It wouldn't have turned out like that, would it?

41
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,830
Hey, Inma, why can't you contact me?

42
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,250
Did you get our Team Leader Jeong's message or not?

43
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,710
Oh, okay

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,840
Hey, you have those personal files that were rummaged through while investigating the Blue Barrel incident, right?

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,550
Take a picture of everything and send it to me. Pictures, notes, everything.

46
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,990
Can't we get on our ship?

47
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,700
Se-eun-ah

48
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,290
It's because of my sister

49
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,210
I missed the boat because of my sister.

50
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,510
My dad just said I was late

51
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,920
My sister just got sick

52
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,340
Look at this

53
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,680
My sister also grabbed me and pulled me like this

54
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,350
Did you know your sister took the spray?

55
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,060
Se-eun told me to pack all the stuff

56
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,520
I think that's what my dad said

57
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,900
Right?

58
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
You dare stab a detective?

59
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
Now you're telling me to leave without even seeing me

60
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,360
Bring our team back immediately

61
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,990
That bastard needs to be arrested

62
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,030
No, I, so

63
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,580
What evidence do we have that that kid is the culprit in our case?

64
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,410
Not yet

65
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,790
So, until now

66
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,540
Because the fact that the real culprit is Seo Se-hyeon remains unchanged

67
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,540
That kid just forged his identity

68
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,750
How about handling it as attempted murder or something like that, Team Leader Hong?

69
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,050
What the hell is the 5th incident victim, kidnapping the suspect, what the heck

70
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,840
If it's all tangled up like this, it's really tiring

71
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,260
No way

72
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,760
Choi Min-guk

73
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,890
We need to start investigating him as an accomplice

74
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,190
Haven't we told you this over and over again?

75
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,900
Choi Min-guk is weird!

76
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,060
What are you?

77
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,230
No, to be frank

78
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,650
The body of the victim he killed

79
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,700
It's shameless to leave it in the bathroom at home

80
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,910
Sir, do you think it is possible? Yes?

81
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,490
I even buried the psychopathic kid in the ground!

82
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,750
Hey, you, sir

83
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,540
Don't you take care of the kids?

84
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,420
Did you know that they were investigating those kids separately or not?

85
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,840
I didn't know. The higher-ups don't know that?

86
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,920
So, the kids who ate honestly

87
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,090
Didn't you get into trouble because you were running wild without permission?

88
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,470
And strictly speaking

89
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,100
We're chasing a kid who has nothing to do with our investigation direction.

90
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,350
If you committed insubordination, then take some responsibility!

91
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
What is this, shi

92
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,820
Anyway, this case is separate

93
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,650
Min-guk Choi, let go for now

94
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,120
Team Leader Hong, we arrested Seo Se-hyeon.

95
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,410
Interrogate him as soon as he wakes up

96
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,910
My baby!

97
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,620
I got stabbed by that kid

98
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,830
The circumstances surrounding the accomplice are also sufficiently suspicious.

99
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,500
Oh, who told you not to catch it?

100
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,420
We have a serial killer right now.

101
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,840
So, it looks like you're completely focused on that.

102
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,970
Min-guk Choi is working in the criminal investigation department.

103
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,140
The overall appearance is good

104
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,060
What does it look like?

105
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,430
I am now

106
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,600
Do you know what I regret most?

107
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,480
When talking about Team Leader Jeong's accomplice

108
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,190
I'm going to try to touch the US

109
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,150
I stopped it like crazy!

110
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,660
I'm going to be treated like this anyway!

111
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,450
Made in the US?

112
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,280
What is this?

113
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,750
Sir, look at this, turn it on.

114
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,040
No, isn't that Choi Min-guk?

115
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,460
Right, it's Choi Min-guk.

116
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,920
The Blue Tong Incident at Cheongun Port in 1999

117
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,760
This is the real appearance of suspect Ko Du-sam.

118
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,440
Oh, no, what the hell is going on?

119
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,060
What about kidnapping Manager Seo?

120
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,560
What do you mean there could be another suspect?

121
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,820
There's nothing to be upset about

122
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Whether Chief Seo is a suspect or not

123
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,200
It's true that it tarnished the reputation of the National Institute of Scientific Investigation.

124
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,910
But since you've been arrested by the police, the investigation will begin.

125
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,330
We need to prepare too

126
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,120
The child finally got through the crisis

127
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,580
Oh, this is giving me a headache

128
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,460
What do you mean by all that?

129
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,550
Nothing has changed, Mr. Chun.

130
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,970
So don't get swept away and keep your mouth shut

131
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,390
From Nam Seung-hyeop's construction to the tailor's

132
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,980
There is no change in the fact that Manager Seo forged the evidence.

133
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,690
Nam Seung-hyeop's case

134
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,650
Isn't it irrelevant?

135
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,900
what?

136
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,280
I understand that you are concerned because we have been working together for a long time.

137
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,200
Manager Seo continues

138
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,620
You said that the Nam Seung-hyeop case needs to be reexamined.

139
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,780
But that day, the director

140
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,910
so?

141
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,040
No, who signed Nam Seung-hyeop's autopsy report?

142
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,330
Who fabricated the evidence in the Yongcheon incident?

143
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,710
For the past 3 years

144
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,180
These are the cases I worked on with Manager Seo.

145
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,350
I kept looking and checking and checking again

146
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,680
Everything was clean!

147
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,600
Mr. Chun

148
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,810
Manager Seo, have you been manipulating or covering up?

149
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,390
There was no attempt whatsoever

150
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,650
There must have been a reason for the Yongcheon incident.

151
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,860
So, we should step forward and help Manager Seo.

152
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,650
Wake up!

153
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,240
You're a murderer, you're a murderer

154
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,780
You have to wrap up who you want to wrap up.

155
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,280
What the heck is that nonsense!

156
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,880
Jump, hurry

157
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,470
Se-eun!

158
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,100
Se-eun!

159
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,060
Se-eun!

160
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,810
Se-eun!

161
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,660
I need to know where they took me

162
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,080
Why is it so quiet?

163
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,340
Sit up straight

164
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,970
What did you do wrong

165
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,270
I'll do it until I know

166
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,480
Got it?

167
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,400
Please look at it carefully so that you don't miss anything.

168
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,110
all right

169
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,940
How long do you think this will take?

170
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,200
Oh, this is taking a while

171
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,320
Because it searches only by face recognition without a name

172
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,580
We need to look through all 800,000 men in their 50s.

173
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,950
And if there is no control group,

174
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,500
It could just be a waste of time.

175
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,620
Well, anyway, identifying the person is the most urgent matter.

176
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,540
Please do it as quickly as possible.

177
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,790
yes

178
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,790
Team leader

179
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,300
The search of Choi Min-guk's laundry and house is over.

180
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,930
I cleaned it all up and there was nothing left to salvage, but

181
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,220
There was something strange about Seo Se-hyeon's movements.

182
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,890
After that, I put the note under the shelf

183
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,810
I left the scene right away

184
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,480
No, why are you looking for the camera first?

185
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,150
Then it's also a bit weird to hide things

186
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,020
What date was this taken?

187
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,820
Yes, the attempted murder case at the laundromat is about to break out.

188
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,200
Did you hide something here before going to meet Choi Min-guk?

189
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,780
Why leave all the other evidence at home and only show this?

190
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,290
That too is as expected

191
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,140
Se-eun-ah

192
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,230
Se-eun-ah

193
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,110
Se-eun!

194
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,400
I have to go to dad

195
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,410
Se-eun!

196
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,570
Se-eun!

197
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,080
Se-eun, come here!

198
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,120
Se-eun, what's wrong?

199
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,460
You can't get away from me

200
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,380
Se-eun, hurry up

201
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,420
Se-eun, I forgive you.

202
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,680
Se-eun!

203
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,520
Patient, are you feeling better?

204
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,310
Oh, the surgery went well.

205
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,770
Is there anything that feels uncomfortable?

206
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,860
Team Leader Jeong

207
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,950
yes?

208
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,830
Who came in with me?

209
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,160
We've passed the hump

210
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,830
Because the wound was deep

211
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,250
I think we'll have to wait and see how he recovers

212
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,320
So, that guy, Choi Min-guk

213
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,900
Aren't you saying that you were roaming around Yongcheon City pretending to be the owner of a laundry shop?

214
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,160
That's one thing, but I'm limping on purpose

215
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,080
I was trying to avoid identifying any possible suspects.

216
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,120
That's more shocking

217
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,120
On the one hand, he's a really great person.

218
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,910
Oh my! Ah

219
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
What's so great about it?

220
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,000
He's still a psycho killer, yikes.

221
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,250
Oh, wait a minute

222
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,920
This is the correct address

223
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,550
Are you here? Yes

224
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,680
What should I do now?

225
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,220
I don't think there's anything to dry?

226
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,140
It's been 20 years

227
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,150
I'd like to meet the residents at least once.

228
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,480
Okay, let's explore.

229
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,780
Just a moment, sir!

230
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,200
Yes, sorry, I need to ask you something.

231
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,000
oh my god

232
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,880
That day

233
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,760
I can't believe it

234
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,560
What I said

235
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,020
sorry

236
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,950
Are you feeling better?

237
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,070
yes

238
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,290
You know that you are wanted as a suspect in the Yongcheon incident, right?

239
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,790
yes

240
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,290
Well, there is no direct evidence

241
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,540
As much as it came out in large quantities from Seo Se-hyeon's house

242
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,460
From our point of view

243
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,510
There is absolutely no problem in prosecuting Mr. Seo Se-hyeon.

244
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,140
There's just one thing that bothers me

245
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,470
What is your relationship with Choi Min-guk?

246
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,970
I need an explanation from Mr. Seo Se-Hyeon.

247
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,390
Is Team Leader Jeong awake?

248
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,690
Please answer the question

249
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,270
Please let me meet Team Leader Jeong

250
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,990
Let me ask you again, what is your relationship with Choi Min-guk?

251
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,160
So what is this?

252
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,330
I found this today on Seo Se-hyeon's route.

253
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,750
Yoon Se-eun

254
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,090
Is this your name?

255
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,520
Ha, that person said earlier that this was somewhere

256
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,150
Yeah, over there, I think it's over there

257
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,440
Why don't I know Jeongmi?

258
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,650
Right next to here was the bar where Jeongmi used to work.

259
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,320
Oh my, I'm taking care of my daughter all by myself

260
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,530
He was a kid who lived hard by doing business.

261
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,620
You met the wrong guy

262
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,580
But why him?

263
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,460
Oh, we are Lee Jeong-mi's husband

264
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,210
I'm looking into Mr. Godusam

265
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,500
I am this person

266
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,710
Oh no, that's not him

267
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,590
Huh? Then who is this person?

268
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,390
His name is, oh my, hold on tight

269
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,260
Yoon Mosikaengi was

270
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,430
Yoon Jo-gyun!

271
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,560
Oh man, I can't even remember that bad boy's name.

272
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,810
Oh, we don't even know that

273
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,820
I thought this man was Lee Jeong-mi's husband.

274
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,860
Oh, yes, I would like to ask you to check my identity.

275
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,190
Yes, I'm a male. Yes, I'm Yoon Jo-gyun.

276
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,860
Hey, before I met Godusam

277
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,200
The two of them lived together as a common-law couple

278
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,160
That guy's daughter and Jeongmi's daughter, four of them

279
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,870
We lived in the same house for quite some time

280
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,500
well

281
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,670
But?

282
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,590
That kid is like a total parasite

283
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,880
I'm sticking to Jeongmi

284
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,720
A beggar who sucks out your spine

285
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,300
So Jeongmi

286
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,100
With Godusam who used to do odd jobs at the store

287
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,390
You already registered your marriage first

288
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,100
Yoonga, I'm going to get that bastard out

289
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,110
Oh, then what the hell is going on in this small town?

290
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,360
It must have been a mess, wasn't it?

291
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,610
What do you mean, that mother abandoned her child and ran away with a man?

292
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,240
Jeongmi got scolded a little

293
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,030
Boy, the two of them ran away in the middle of the night.

294
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,540
Oh, really? When?

295
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,870
Okay, let's see

296
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,920
98? 99?

297
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,290
Oh, I don't remember exactly

298
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,010
But it's still a mystery

299
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,430
He's definitely not the kind of person who would abandon his own children

300
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,100
I wonder if that kid was that annoying

301
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,270
No, but that bastard Yoonga

302
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,810
Hey, what? You're going around causing trouble, calling yourself Godusam, right now?

303
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,690
Hey, brother? Yes? Ah

304
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,690
ah

305
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,820
Why? Me, me

306
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,740
yes

307
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,200
Whew

308
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,370
Eunseo, she was really pretty and kind

309
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,000
He takes good care of his daughter like a younger sister

310
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,380
After looking at the CCTV camera for a long time

311
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,630
Why are you hiding this note?

312
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,690
Do you remember Go Eun-seo?

313
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,030
Since 2004, the same year that Mr. Seo Se-hyeon entered the orphanage

314
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,490
There was no trace of life.

315
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,860
Since 2006

316
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,160
He was declared dead along with his mother, Lee Jeong-mi.

317
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,990
Go Eun-seo's father is named Godusam.

318
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,000
You know the Cheongun Port blue barrel incident, right?

319
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,630
I was a suspect in that case

320
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,210
It has been confirmed that he is the same person as Choi Min-guk.

321
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,300
And the place where this photo was taken is Godusam in Haryeong

322
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,470
That is, it was Choi Min-guk's house yard.

323
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,090
And here

324
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,100
The footsteps of Mr. Seo Se-hyeon, presumed to be recent,

325
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,060
Choi Min-guk's footprints were also discovered

326
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,890
Still don't you know Choi Min-guk?

327
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,320
Mr. Seo Se-Hyeon

328
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,900
It's a shame that you keep refusing to make statements like this

329
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,870
It will never be beneficial

330
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,830
What is your relationship with Choi Min-guk?

331
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,910
Why did Choi Min-guk kidnap Seo Se-hyeon?

332
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,710
Please tell me the truth, at least

333
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,830
We can investigate accurately

334
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,380
There is no evidence that Choi Min-guk is the culprit.

335
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,880
Are you going to cover it all by yourself?

336
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,090
Manager Seo

337
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,390
I'll tell you everything

338
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,190
instead

339
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,900
Please hold a press conference

340
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,990
Don't tell me, the bleeding is severe.

341
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,030
Oh, over there, over there

342
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,070
Excuse me, someone help me! Excuse me!

343
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,120
Oh, team leader

344
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,710
No, over there, who's calling 119?

345
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,460
Please call 119, okay?

346
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,840
Team leader

347
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,750
"72 hours"

348
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,970
Recent Yongcheon serial murder case

349
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,090
was identified as a prime suspect

350
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,100
Seo Se-hyeon, a star autopsy specialist from the National Forensic Service

351
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,770
I called an emergency press conference.

352
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,480
Through this press conference

353
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,270
Confession diary on the Yongcheon serial murder case

354
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,770
As to whether another suspect will emerge

355
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,940
The future is drawing attention

356
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,490
Seo Se-hyeon, who is also the autopsy doctor in charge of the case of athlete Nam Seung-hyeop,

357
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,030
At this press conference, the drug use

358
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,660
Okay, a little further to the left.

359
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,910
A little further back, a little further back

360
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,250
Team leader, is this okay?

361
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,260
If you say anything strange

362
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,510
There will be chaos then

363
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,680
No, is there a reason it has to be a press conference?

364
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,260
When someone you know asks you to do something impossible,

365
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,600
There is a good reason why I show my face

366
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,640
He will definitely move

367
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,400
Oh, that means

368
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,980
I'll be the bait

369
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,550
It's open!

370
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,810
Okay, I'll pass.

371
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,680
Okay, let's take a moment

372
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,340
This is Seo Se-hyeon, head of the forensic medicine department at the Seoul Institute of Scientific Investigation.

373
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,050
I am

374
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,430
He is a prime suspect in the Yongcheon serial murder case.

375
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,270
From 1999 to 2004

376
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,940
A total of six

377
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,560
The real culprit of the unsolved murder case

378
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,070
Yoon Jo-gyun's

379
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
She is my daughter
