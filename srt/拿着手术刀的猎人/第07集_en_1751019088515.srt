1
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,310
Yoon Se-eun

2
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,190
Okay, now it's yours

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,280
From now on, there is something I want to eat and something I want to have.

4
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,320
Write it down in this notebook

5
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,280
Then I'll buy it for you

6
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,740
Instead, you should write a picture diary every day.

7
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,240
What is a diary?

8
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,700
hmm

9
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,620
What did you do that day? Was it fun or sad?

10
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,210
That's what I use

11
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,570
Yoon Se-eun, why is the background all red?

12
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,780
Hey, if you do this, only the red color will wear out. Use a different color.

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,280
Give it to me, I have to paint this too

14
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,240
Does it have to be red?

15
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,950
What is this?

16
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,500
ocean

17
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,120
what?

18
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,290
Hey, who paints the sea red?

19
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,340
Look, it looks more like the ocean than red, right?

20
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,300
Ah! Ah! Ah, I remembered!

21
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,640
The whole time I was watching it I thought, 'Who does it look like?'

22
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,810
What is this look like?

23
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,020
Doesn't he look like Manager Seo?

24
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,600
Hey, hey, oh my, oh my!

25
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,230
Ah, the nose is the center of this face, even if it is the eyes and hair.

26
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,320
The noses are completely different!

27
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,570
That guy is a detective from the violent crimes unit

28
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,490
With such an innocent and naive eye, really, tsk

29
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,860
First, let's say you're a woman in your 30s.

30
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,780
Among the residents of Yongcheon City

31
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,910
First, we will select people with similar appearances.

32
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,830
So, the child is the first to catch the missing child?

33
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,330
Team leader

34
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,750
Oh, yes, it's a photo from 2003, so that's the priority.

35
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,260
Montage is not installed today?

36
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,090
Oh, yes, the support team is out right now.

37
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,470
The old city area is already completed

38
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,640
The new city side will also be finished by today.

39
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,970
First, let's get the montage report.

40
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,810
You know what? A solid guy gets caught.

41
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,230
Then it's good

42
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
Oh, didn't anything come out of the investigation yesterday?

43
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,190
Oh my, what the heck is this

44
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,940
There is no contact between the victims, no contact

45
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,440
Our routes don't overlap, and our acquaintances don't overlap.

46
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,820
Ah! The first and third victims

47
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,120
The financial records do overlap.

48
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Where are you?

49
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,660
Hey, Min-guk, this is your brother's laundry shop.

50
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,750
You little shit, just stay still, I

51
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,120
Oh my! Really, really

52
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,540
Hey, you went to get that dry cleaned?

53
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,380
If you look at it that way, the Yongcheon floor incident was all about Min-guk hyung? Huh?

54
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,380
Okay, okay, get moving!

55
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,340
Oh, and if you see someone similar to that montage

56
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,470
I'll check your background, okay? Yes.

57
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,560
Team leader, Min-guk and I will stop by for a bit

58
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,390
Just in case there's any more good information out there

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,210
Hey, Yoon Se-eun

60
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,340
If this goes on, everything will be ruined

61
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,440
Would you like me to teach you too?

62
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,940
Fold the cloth and put it together

63
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,480
This needle

64
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,570
If you put them alternately between these folded fabrics,

65
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,290
With a ribbon knot

66
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,580
completion!

67
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,080
Doesn't it look great when sewn like this?

68
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,880
They don't seem separate, do they?

69
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,050
Play with it and say, "It's pretty."

70
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,470
If you rip it again, you'll get a big scolding from your sister

71
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Eunseo, you, go to your room and study now.

72
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,080
Yes, Dad

73
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,130
I'll come later

74
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,770
Don't slack off and practice

75
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,020
I have to go on a business trip soon.

76
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,720
So what happened to Eunseo?

77
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,850
Did you kill him?

78
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,970
When bitten by a dog, don't try to pull your hand away.

79
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,270
Need to push deeper

80
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,770
Open your mouth and let go of your hands

81
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,320
Well, here it is, huh?

82
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,950
203 Building 802

83
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,170
Pink blouse 20,000 won

84
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,460
Pick up in person on February 13th

85
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, that's right

86
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,590
You haven't come back since then?

87
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,130
Yeah, I didn't see it?

88
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,880
When you drop off your laundry and pick it up

89
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,260
The content of the phone call was a bit strange.

90
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,850
Or was there anything like that where you felt uneasy about the person you came with?

91
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,390
Oh, well

92
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,020
I think I came alone both times

93
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,980
There was nothing special about it

94
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,610
But if it's Daemyung Apartment, it's in the new city center.

95
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,900
Do you get guests there too?

96
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,030
ah

97
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,860
Well, that's it, our laundry is a little bit

98
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,280
Here, my brother's family is the best in Yongcheon.

99
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,740
There are quite a few people here

100
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,740
Oh, well, not really like that

101
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,580
Our Hyukgeun's pants are washed by his older brother

102
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,210
Seriously, I was really surprised.

103
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,000
I saw you were shaking your leg a little bit earlier.

104
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,960
Oh, oh, this?

105
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,670
Oh, is this too obvious?

106
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Oh, my older brother had a car accident a while ago.

107
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,190
Anyway, me, brother, what

108
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,850
Thank you for your time

109
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,060
Oh, oh, no, thank you

110
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,440
Come anytime if you have any problems

111
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,440
Thank you, brother

112
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,650
But what is that?

113
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,400
Oh, that's the laundry room.

114
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,740
Can I take a look for a moment?

115
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,490
Yes? Oh, what, back there again?

116
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,620
Just go, go, oh, no, no

117
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,500
Because the door is open

118
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,120
Take a look around

119
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,560
Ha, sir

120
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,270
I'm sorry, bro.

121
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,310
Well, no, that could be possible.

122
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,110
Yongcheon Middle School

123
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,320
Yongcheon Middle School

124
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,010
I'm sorry, bro.

125
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,930
No, if it's originally stuck

126
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,680
I'm going to yell at you without thinking about the consequences.

127
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,350
Oh, sometimes I really want to just throw it away

128
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,270
No, you might be wondering, well

129
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,410
Oh, bro, hold on to your phone for a second

130
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah

131
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,580
Oh, it's over now?

132
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,670
Oh, you've worked hard. How's your condition?

133
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,130
Nothing much, right?

134
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,130
Oh, it's been so long

135
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,430
I'm a little embarrassed to show you

136
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,100
Because I'm just trying to make a living

137
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,100
No, thank you for your cooperation.

138
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,720
Child, whenever you need

139
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,270
Why are you like that?

140
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,440
what?

141
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,080
No, I just went out to explore.

142
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,830
Stir up all the karma

143
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,120
Even if this is a city

144
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,330
Unlike Seoul, word spreads quickly

145
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,250
Later there

146
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,210
Go buy something to drink and bring it with you

147
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,590
'I'm sorry', huh?

148
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,760
Please speak so honestly

149
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,970
Senior

150
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,140
Let's investigate President Choi Min-guk.

151
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,510
Oh, why is the conversation going in that direction again?

152
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,140
It also falls into the category of acquaintance crime

153
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,600
Also, laundromats use bleach, needles and thread, etc.

154
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,610
Plastic products such as buckets and cleaning brushes are also widely used.

155
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,520
Oh, what should I say again?

156
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,650
By that logic, I should be investigated too.

157
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,610
We have a ton of those at our house.

158
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,860
then

159
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,660
How about this?

160
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,210
Similar, right?

161
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,000
Didn't this person walk normally?

162
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,630
That's true, though

163
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
uh?

164
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,720
Manager Seo, my goodness

165
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,300
Since we are neighbors, we meet again like this

166
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,270
Yeah, but where are you going?

167
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,310
uh?

168
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,770
Are you hurt?

169
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,560
I just bumped into something

170
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,110
But what

171
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,820
Is it blood?

172
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,990
blood?

173
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,530
It's nothing special

174
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,320
ah

175
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,580
I thought you were hurt again

176
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,830
then

177
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,080
Hey, manager

178
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,790
Well, we have that.

179
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,290
Oh, I forgot

180
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,000
This is the drug test report for the first and second incidents.

181
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,590
I've been out of my mind lately

182
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,380
I only received it verbally and didn't get the documents.

183
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,720
Could you please forward it to me?

184
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,470
Oh, that

185
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,010
I have to give it to you

186
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,520
How long should I give it to you?

187
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,230
Oh, that's it

188
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,150
These days, I have to report to the chief every day.

189
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,570
Is it possible for you to do this today?

190
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,940
I'll give it to you today if possible.

191
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,160
Well then, thank you for your hard work.

192
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,290
Take care

193
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,050
Did you get in okay?

194
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,220
What do you want to do?

195
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,090
That's what dad would say

196
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,340
Were you really planning to kill me?

197
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,680
That's not for you to say

198
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,850
They are petty and they are burning people with electricity

199
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,140
No, then

200
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,270
A daughter who I haven't seen in a long time points a knife at her father

201
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,270
Becoming a parent

202
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,320
Can't you even give me that much advice?

203
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,610
Have you seen the montage?

204
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,280
What montage?

205
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,530
Your gift

206
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,360
It was all over Yongcheon

207
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,240
Oh, that? Do you like it?

208
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,250
Dad can do other things too

209
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,620
Depending on what you do

210
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,790
I'm in a lot of trouble right now because of you.

211
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,710
Let's not do this among ourselves

212
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,970
Let's create a criminal

213
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,680
and

214
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,600
Oh, this, this is Manager Seo's story, right?

215
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,140
Oh, I thought the incident was over

216
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,390
Oh my, what kind of trouble is this over a single pill?

217
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,350
But what about this guy? He's really a drug user, right? Rumors are going around.

218
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,480
Oh, what is this, 'inability to feel emotions'?

219
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,860
Oh, I don't know who wrote this

220
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,900
Manager Seo, you must have a huge headache.

221
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,570
Round knee

222
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,660
Did you spray the montage? Yes

223
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,870
What is the status of the report?

224
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,120
Well, it's still quiet

225
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,250
What, I was going crazy like crazy while searching for the wooden door and the search box.

226
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,040
Well, nothing is quite clear yet

227
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,250
No, what if you give me even a little bit?

228
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,340
So, the blue barrel incident I mentioned yesterday

229
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,340
This kid is really telling me to let him know, shit

230
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,300
Didn't I tell you not to even mention the US name?

231
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,140
Yes, I know

232
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,800
But please listen to me just once

233
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,720
I do that because it really looks like there's something there.

234
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,520
It's also very related to our case.

235
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,930
Honestly, the culprit of this incident

236
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,270
No one thinks this is their first offense, right?

237
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,070
Look

238
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,950
A body washed in seventeen pieces with bleach

239
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,240
Death from cervical fracture

240
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,990
Pancuronium from needle marks

241
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,740
In addition, this suspect, Godusam,

242
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,700
We also had a daughter of the same age as the child in our photo.

243
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,040
Oh, if only there was medicine

244
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
It's exactly like us.

245
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,080
Hey, Mr.

246
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,210
Whose side are you on?

247
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,090
Where is the convenience? To investigate

248
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,630
So, regarding the girl in the photo discovered this time,

249
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,420
As the investigation progresses

250
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,970
If you dig into this case, something will come out

251
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,090
Yeah, okay

252
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,470
That makes sense

253
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,760
That's a very plausible logic.

254
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,350
I will give full authority to Team Leader Jeong in this regard.

255
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,480
Let's try to push it forward freely

256
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,150
Really? Huh

257
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,020
But I can't get the kids out

258
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,190
Kids who are already busy

259
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,440
If you turn it to the US, everyone will rise up

260
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,660
This is Team Leader Jeong's idea, so it's Team Leader Jeong's line.

261
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,700
Let's try to solve it somehow

262
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,830
Okay, and let's not get discouraged, okay?

263
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,540
No, we need to show that we are focused on the current situation.

264
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,710
280,000 citizens of Yongcheon sleep soundly

265
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,840
And you, Team Leader Jeong

266
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,300
You have to salvage at least some of the will you showed.

267
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,930
Oh man, shit

268
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,230
Now the team leader too

269
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,770
It's time for you to feel it

270
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,610
In the midst of this shortage of manpower,

271
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,110
We need to focus the investigation on one path.

272
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,650
If the team leader wanders around like this alone,

273
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,700
The ones who really put in the effort are my team members.

274
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,670
Let's create a culprit?

275
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,800
Do you still have Oh Min-ho's body?

276
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,760
Hand that over to me, along with your long-term.

277
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,350
I'll plant another guy's DNA and make you a suspect.

278
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,100
What you did

279
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,310
I can handle everything neatly

280
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,060
hmm

281
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,270
Will you take care of it?

282
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,530
But why did our Se-eun's heart suddenly change?

283
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,110
If only you hadn't put my picture on the corpse

284
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,030
This would never have happened

285
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,070
So, let's organize it

286
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,250
Let's clean up the mess and start over.

287
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,330
hmm

288
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,590
okay

289
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,960
I'll prepare the culprit for you

290
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,800
There's a guy the police are watching anyway

291
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,850
If you go to their house and bring them something that could be used as DNA

292
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,930
I'll plant it in the dismembered corpse and throw it away

293
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,730
Then you autopsy it

294
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,900
And then you just need to check the suspect's identity.

295
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,110
It's more fun having a daughter who is a forensic scientist

296
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,570
Dad will prepare the tea for you too.

297
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,360
It's been a while since I've stretched out my body a bit.

298
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,330
'Incapable of emotion'

299
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,240
Are you okay?

300
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,200
If there's anything I can help you with, please feel free to contact me.

301
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,050
Daughter, how are you?

302
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,060
Ha, it's noisy.

303
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,580
Oh, Dad forgot

304
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,420
Dad didn't have time to clean up, please take care of that.

305
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,630
what?

306
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,180
The equipment is my dad's, so you can use it as much as you want.

307
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,350
I see everything

308
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,770
This kid

309
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,720
Se-eun-ah

310
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,510
Time is up

311
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,180
yes

312
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,140
What the fuck, who are you?

313
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,390
Who are you to kill me? Who sent you!

314
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,560
I see

315
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,820
What are you, sir?

316
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,030
uh?

317
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:28,330
I feel like I've seen this somewhere before, huh?

318
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,870
Oh, you're on TV
