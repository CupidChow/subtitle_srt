1
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,410
On this birthday

2
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,420
My sister will throw me a birthday party without telling dad.

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,130
Just roughly clean up this place with rocks

4
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,750
I'll wash it all tomorrow

5
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,720
Change your clothes and do it, if you jump in you'll stink

6
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,990
Okay, so I was attacked while I was sleeping.

7
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,280
Why did that woman show up and attack me again?

8
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,820
And you treated him?

9
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,990
Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's right! Yes?

10
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,870
How many times do I have to say this!

11
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,330
Okay, okay, look, look, okay?

12
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,840
It's all sewn up here, right?

13
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,130
wait for a sec

14
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,800
Is that woman really this woman?

15
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,090
Yes, that's right

16
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,890
That's right, that's right!

17
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,720
But why didn't you report it right away?

18
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,720
How is it?

19
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,730
They say if you don't want to die, hide for a week.

20
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,150
Oh, I told you that if you didn't listen, I was going to kill you.

21
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,650
If you don't want to die

22
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,450
Been hiding for a week

23
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,410
Do you remember who attacked first?

24
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,290
no

25
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,290
Oh, that happened so quickly

26
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,170
ah

27
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,670
What smell? What smell?

28
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,590
smell of rocks

29
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,300
That's right

30
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
It came out of my hand

31
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,970
I'm sleeping

32
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,260
Then that pungent smell of laxatives came in

33
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,020
I'm deep in here

34
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,520
Detective Se-Hyeon is talking

35
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,320
I've been living off energy bars for the past 5 years.

36
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,360
They say killing takes a lot of energy

37
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,660
Would a child like that commit such a heinous act?

38
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,330
You said you didn't believe me

39
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,250
But what else do you need to say?

40
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,510
What did Kwon Hyung-jo say?

41
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,840
Oh, things have gotten really funny.

42
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,550
They say there is someone else who attacked you

43
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,260
Seo Se-Hyeon actually gave her treatment?

44
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,810
then

45
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,890
In the first place, Manager Seo wasn't the culprit.

46
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,350
That's how it happens

47
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,150
I couldn't see his face, but he was a man.

48
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,280
You said your hands smelled like bleach?

49
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,700
Does it smell like rocks? Yes.

50
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,450
Surely it's as the team leader said

51
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,250
It seems more likely to be Choi Min-guk

52
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,540
And Seo Se-Hyeon for some reason

53
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,840
I already knew about Choi Min-guk's existence

54
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,050
He may be an accomplice

55
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,630
It might not be the case, considering he attacked Choi Min-guk.

56
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,720
Oh, of course

57
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,560
They may have conspired to confuse the investigation.

58
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,980
No, that won't be the case.

59
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,190
Oh, well, we'll find out if we investigate.

60
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,820
The problem is this

61
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,150
The team leader

62
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,740
It'll be very difficult to get the chief's approval.

63
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,950
With the public wanted list and Kang Soo-dae's presence

64
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,410
Hey

65
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,290
Oh, I wonder if Team Leader Hong could raise the flag a bit, right?

66
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,290
I will do it without your permission.

67
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,210
yes?

68
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,540
Senior

69
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,630
Please help me

70
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,130
Yongcheon Clean Laundry CEO Choi Min-guk

71
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,340
I said we should investigate him as a strong suspect.

72
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,720
therefore

73
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,100
You said you'd do it after Seo Se-hyeon caught it, but don't you understand?

74
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,020
Hey, what do you think, Team Leader Hong?

75
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,110
Just because it smelled like rocks

76
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,980
Choi Min-guk, the current victim of the 5th incident

77
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,900
Can't we just assume he's a suspect?

78
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,160
And I heard that he has a disability in his legs.

79
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
The suspect in the CCTV of the second bus

80
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,330
In the process of chasing the victim

81
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,250
showed normal gait

82
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,370
okay?

83
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,420
Oh, yeah, well, that's true

84
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,340
And the point of contact for the first and third victims is the laundry shop run by CEO Choi Min-guk.

85
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,170
Of course, it should be investigated

86
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,140
I understand that the investigation has already been conducted

87
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,970
Yes? Oh, yes

88
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,310
Oh, yeah, what

89
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,770
Because back then the situation was a bit different from now

90
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,810
No, I'm investigating the witness

91
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,400
Are you saying that it depends on the situation?

92
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,650
No, that's not it

93
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,480
No, but Team Leader Hong really talks strangely, huh?

94
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,030
No, so what are you saying is we've been messing around with the investigation until now?

95
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,490
It's noisy

96
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,990
What did you do to deserve raising your voice?

97
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,620
Team Leader Hong did all the work for me

98
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,580
Are you just having some free time?

99
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,750
You, Changjin

100
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,710
Go down to the traffic department right away starting today.

101
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,040
Hey, chief

102
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,630
Oh, that's a bit

103
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,590
Incidents keep happening

104
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,130
A kid who was just dragged around helplessly

105
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,220
Where are you talking about American products without any fear?

106
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,600
You're touching innocent civilians who have no connection to anything?

107
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,520
Go down and reflect before you take off your clothes.

108
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,600
Oh, brother!

109
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,900
What if you really go?

110
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,980
Oh, just hold on tight!

111
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,530
Even if I try to open the stomach, it'll just burst my stomach.

112
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,160
No, I can't. I'll just go and take it.

113
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,320
Just stand still

114
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,200
Oh, then, even knowing this unreasonable situation

115
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,620
Are you telling me to stay still, right now?

116
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,160
Hey, stay still

117
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,830
It's okay, I'll be back soon.

118
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,120
But Team Leader Jeong isn't here either

119
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,040
Oh, if you go too, my brother, our team will be completely torn in half.

120
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,340
kid

121
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,470
Me, that, Min-guk hyung, no

122
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,010
Min-guk Choi, are you giving up like this?

123
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,850
Why give up? We need to investigate.

124
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,430
Yes? Then, is there a big picture that you designed?

125
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
hey

126
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,230
Team Leader Jeong's personality

127
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,110
I'm sure I'll be able to hang on even if I'm alone

128
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,360
Shouldn't we help out a little bit too?

129
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,610
Oh, then of course we should go too.

130
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,860
You guys are out

131
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,160
This is ridiculous! Why are we missing out!

132
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,080
Hey, Inma, how long has it been since you joined the Power Team?

133
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,370
It just keeps growing

134
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,710
With my accumulated investigative know-how,

135
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,330
It can prolong life in an emergency, but

136
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,790
Hey, you're a human, you're just out

137
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,550
no way

138
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,340
Brother, you're not in a position to take such an adventure.

139
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,260
My sister-in-law seems to be feeling a little sick and is taking it easy.

140
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,050
This just won't pass, will it?

141
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,930
My brother's pension is at stake, so I'll just do it

142
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,600
My wife won't say anything

143
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,520
I've become a fan of Team Leader Jeong in the meantime

144
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,030
Hey, that kid, even in the midst of all that busy work

145
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,700
He took great care of my wife as she was in and out of the hospital room.

146
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,660
Go

147
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,240
I don't know what you're up to, brother.

148
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,620
I don't know about Seok-woo, but don't even dream of getting rid of me, okay?

149
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,290
Hey, what are you doing? Hey, I absolutely can't get off either.

150
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,130
Get on, brother! Let's go!

151
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,290
hey

152
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,590
Oh, this bird

153
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,840
Yes, sir

154
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,680
Where are you?

155
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,100
Oh, that's near the police station.

156
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,430
I also moved to the civil affairs office today!

157
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,640
Senior, is it because of me?

158
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,150
Yes! It's 100% because of the team leader.

159
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,440
So from now on, you have to listen to me.

160
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,360
Yes? Before Choi Min-guk was discharged from the hospital.

161
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,450
I'm thinking about robbing the laundry shop

162
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,240
Can you come now?

163
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,530
If you don't come, it's a betrayal, a betrayal! Team leader, you must come!

164
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,450
Almost there now!

165
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,910
I'm really upset, if you don't come for a long time!

166
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,140
Have you finished the discharge procedures? Oh, yes.

167
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,470
Come visit our laundry shop later.

168
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,770
I take responsibility

169
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,850
We will definitely give a 30% discount to our nurses.

170
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,230
Oh my, really?

171
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,020
Oh, yes, please spread the word.

172
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,630
But senior

173
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,040
Is it okay for the civil affairs office seat to remain empty?

174
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,880
Oh, what, what is it, what

175
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,300
Isn't lunch time an excuse?

176
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,510
sorry

177
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,890
For no reason because of me

178
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,970
Hey, stop it!

179
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,140
Brother, look here.

180
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,730
It looks like a girl's room

181
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,150
But didn't you say that Choi Min-guk's daughter died?

182
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,240
container

183
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,490
Right?

184
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,170
What the heck?

185
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,160
hey

186
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,830
There aren't any fingerprints?

187
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,750
Oh, how could that be possible without deliberately erasing it?

188
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,000
Team leader

189
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,250
Choi Min-guk has appeared, Choi Min-guk

190
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,300
Come, come

191
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,170
Please give me some time

192
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,600
Brother, I'm surprised

193
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,360
Hey, are you discharged from the hospital already?

194
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,030
Yeah ah

195
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
what

196
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,490
There was no serious injury

197
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,880
Me, brother

198
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,250
He, he returned to the scene of the incident so quickly

199
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,090
Is the doctor okay?

200
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,340
Yes? That

201
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,300
Post-traumatic stress disorder? Well, there's something like that.

202
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,760
You've been through such a hard time here, yes

203
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,970
Just, the events of that day just came to mind, yeah

204
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,100
It's annoying

205
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,440
are you okay

206
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,400
Oh, I see

207
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,150
Detective Park

208
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,960
You're talking a bit too long today.

209
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,920
ah

210
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,210
Me?

211
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,680
Huh? Huh, bro, just a minute

212
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,100
Yes, brother

213
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,520
Oh, yes, I will go now.

214
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,560
Brother, I'll go first

215
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,560
Yes, brother, ah, yes, yes, yes

216
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,140
If you cut towards the inside of the blade, it will cut better.

217
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,520
No need to hurt your pride

218
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,360
When I was young too

219
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,780
My sister told me everything

220
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,280
I can do it by myself

221
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,920
But my dad said that

222
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,380
Sister, you said your sister killed you?

223
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,380
Sister, sister

224
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,210
Is that Eunseo?

225
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,230
I think I need to go to the hospital.

226
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,860
No, you have to stay here until dad comes.

227
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,480
I'm in serious condition

228
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,740
Do you think your dad will just leave you alone if I do something wrong?

229
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,950
Just a moment

230
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,630
Do you know what that is?

231
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,170
It's a watch

232
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,130
That's not just a watch

233
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,470
When you need help

234
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,100
It's a very special watch that can call someone.

235
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,890
Oh, that's ridiculous

236
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,060
Don't you believe it?

237
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,560
Long press the big button next to it

238
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,110
The red button is floating

239
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,860
Just press that

240
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,900
then

241
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,360
Someone will come to save you.

242
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,160
Then who's coming? Dad?

243
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,910
at that time

244
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,290
The person you want to see the most

245
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,260
Look, that won't work.

246
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,060
That's because the battery is dead

247
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,020
If you pretend to charge your dad's phone

248
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,480
Oh, I know what it is

249
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,150
This is where you plug in the wire.

250
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,230
that's right

251
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,900
You're smart

252
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,990
Sister, sister!

253
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,630
Yes, this is Choi Min-guk.

254
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,040
Hello, this is Mr. Choi from Yongcheonseo Joint Team.

255
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,920
Oh, yes, hello

256
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,960
Yes, but why

257
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,590
Yes, nothing else

258
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,260
Uh, we're in this attack

259
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,760
I would like to conduct a reference investigation.

260
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,970
I'm sorry, but you're still recovering.

261
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,560
Would you be able to visit today?

262
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,560
Oh, oh, yes

263
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,850
Or to where we are

264
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,480
Oh, I have to go.

265
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,230
Yes, everyone is working hard day and night

266
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,320
See you later then

267
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,480
Yes, yes, I understand.

268
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,440
Then I will come to you within an hour.

269
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,360
yes

270
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,740
Those idiots

271
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,700
Investigate for a hundred days, day and night

272
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,160
Sister

273
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,790
are you okay?

274
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,420
Sister

275
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,670
Sister, are you okay?

276
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,880
Hey ah

277
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,090
It's me, sir

278
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,680
Did something come out?

279
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,430
Um, that's it

280
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,600
yesterday

281
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,100
Did you deposit the car rental fee?

282
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,190
Rental car?

283
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,480
No, why did the gentleman in the hospital rent it?

284
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,980
Is it suspicious?

285
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,160
Rental car number not confirmed?

286
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Hand over

287
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,830
Brother Changjin

288
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,410
Can I get CCTV there?

289
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,590
The car that Choi Min-guk rented just passed through Yongcheon IC.

290
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,540
I'm still tracking it

291
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,460
I will share it with you as soon as I confirm the location.

292
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,010
Take the highway first

293
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:50,770
"72 hours"

294
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,830
dad

295
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,960
How are you, sister?

296
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,750
I need to go to the hospital

297
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,520
To go on a boat by the appointed time

298
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,350
I have to leave right now

299
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,270
Where are we going?

300
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,110
Sister, you take care of it yourself

301
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,200
dad

302
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,420
dad

303
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,470
I'm so sick

304
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,880
'87 weeks 6890'

305
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,300
Senior, please check 6890 in 87 weeks

306
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,050
Diazepam

307
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,720
Amoxicillin

308
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,390
Oxycodone

309
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,720
please

310
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,730
It has to be these drugs

311
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,650
Got it?

312
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,750
Did you hear from your sister that you should buy some medicine?

313
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,410
Yes, I wrote it all down here.

314
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,090
You go and come back

315
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,380
Dad will take care of my sister

316
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,730
Come here

317
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,860
Just hold on a little longer

318
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,160
Dad's hands are healing hands

319
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,290
Dad's hands are healing hands

320
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:52,920
Yes, sir

321
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,550
Yes, I checked and it's 6890 at 87 weeks.

322
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,800
It was a vehicle number that had been reported stolen.

323
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,600
I found it. I'll take a picture of the location.

324
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,930
We're almost there now

325
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,020
Please wait a moment

326
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,190
Hey, team leader!

327
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,400
No matter what happens, never move alone.

328
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,440
You knew it, right?

329
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,800
Why don't you just come in with money?

330
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,510
That's what my sister wrote down

331
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,060
You need a prescription to buy it

332
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,860
What kind of medicine is it?

333
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,690
Open your hands

334
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,070
Hurry up!

335
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,090
dad

336
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,470
Show me your scars

337
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,470
Could you please buy me some first aid supplies?

338
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,750
Hey, team leader!

339
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,580
No matter what happens, never move alone.

340
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,590
You knew it, right?

341
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,840
Yes, welcome

342
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,390
Oh, yes, hello

343
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,310
Oh, yes, well, what would you like?

344
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,520
Oh, yes

345
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,810
My daughter got hurt a little bit, so mom

346
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,480
Oh my, oh my, what happened

347
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,690
no

348
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,780
But this isn't something you should come to the pharmacy for.

349
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,110
I think you should go to the hospital.

350
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,240
My daughter is a doctor, a doctor

351
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,200
No, still

352
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,040
I think you should go to the hospital.

353
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,200
it's okay

354
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,960
Because we only do basic treatment before going to the hospital

355
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,960
Anti-inflammatory pain reliever and wound ointment

356
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,840
Just give me a compression bandage and gauze.

357
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,090
Oh, yes

358
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,550
wait a minute

359
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,150
here

360
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,900
How much is it?

361
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,440
Yes, it's 8 thousand won.

362
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,490
Here it is, here it is

363
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,450
Yes, just a moment, yes

364
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,960
Dad! Dad!

365
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,340
Se-eun-ah, Se-eun-ah

366
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,050
Dad! Call the police right away!

367
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,720
Dad! Dad! Se-eun, Se-eun

368
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,930
