00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:21,633
(Park Joo Hyun)

2
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:27,867
(Park Yong-woo)

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,333
(Kang Hoon)

4
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:55,067
(Hunter with a scalpel)

5
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:57,133
(The names of the places and characters in this drama
The background setting is purely fictional and has nothing to do with reality)

6
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:59,067
(Child actors are accompanied by their guardians during filming
Animal scenes have experts on site and follow animal protection regulations)

7
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,800
I don't want to cut

8
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,333
I also want to grow long hair like my sister

9
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,600
What nonsense

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,800
How beautiful you are now

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,933
Didn't Dad say that?

12
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:15,033
We are

13
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,167
Different from other ordinary children

14
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:21,533
When I went on a business trip with my father

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,333
Short hair is more convenient, isn't it?

16
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,833
(Gao Enshu)

17
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,333
Almost done

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,133
How about it? It's beautiful, right?

19
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:50,700
Eun-seo, come here

20
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,267
Let's take a photo together after a long time.

21
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,233
Shien put his hand down

22
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:05,233
Look at the lens

23
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,067
Just look at the lens

24
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,433
I want to take a photo

25
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:14,167
One Two

26
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:23,367
(Hunter with a scalpel)

27
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:25,433
(Episode 6)

28
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:27,100
madman

29
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,233
He really tried hard to ask us to play with him.

30
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,967
hateful

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,467
The ink on the report I wrote today hasn't even dried yet.

32
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,833
Deliberately want us to eat turtle

33
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,333
Near the police station

34
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:43,000
The director will go crazy again if he finds out.

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,067
Damn

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,700
How did that guy know this late at night?

37
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,100
- Get him out of here
-yes

38
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,467
Brother, why are you here again?

39
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,433
Let's go out first.

40
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,567
- Get out first
- What is it?

41
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:01,433
No photography allowed

42
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,833
Please go out first

43
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,067
Are you scared?

44
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:09,233
no

45
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,200
Who discovered it first?

46
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,067
Yes, this is our district.

47
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,467
Around 2:24

48
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:18,400
Received a report of a body being found

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,867
After finding out it was a homicide, they immediately took control of the scene.

50
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,367
Did the original reporter leave any personal information?

51
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:26,400
This one... She should be around here

52
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,500
Over there

53
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,367
After confirming the site, apply for a photo check.

54
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,500
Because the experience is complete.

55
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:02,867
Are you doubting me?

56
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,967
I feel like I'm under investigation now

57
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:08,700
No, I doubt you.

58
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,000
Even if a temporary autopsy room is set up

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,100
It's not like every time you need an autopsy

60
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,700
You are such a busy person, but you live here directly.

61
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,533
Even if it's about your team members, it's still a little suspicious.

62
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:20,167
Does Guokesou agree with you to do this?

63
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:22,600
You are asked to personally participate in the investigation and find the body.

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,733
Does Guokesou also have skip-level promotions?

65
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:28,367
If you solve a big case, you can rise quickly.

66
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,200
Well, detectives,

67
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,000
What if a team member is killed?
Will you still remain indifferent?

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,067
You just called me suspicious, didn't you?

69
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,967
I think your reaction is weird.

70
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,333
The second victim, Wu Minhao

71
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,233
He's the medical examiner in charge of this case.

72
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:47,733
So far no one has found out

73
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:50,667
Why did forensic doctor Wu become the target of this case?

74
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,200
We also...

75
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,000
Our scientific research is more than ever
Take this case more seriously.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
Set up a temporary autopsy room at Ryongchon University Hospital

77
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,033
It is also to show our determination to investigate the case.

78
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:04,067
He even said he was promoted above his level... That's amazing

79
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,800
Just saying it casually

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,600
The search was originally to start
Start by carefully checking the small places

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,233
If Chief Rui Ke could be like today

82
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:16,533
An autopsy at the crime scene would be a good thing for us.

83
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,967
It will definitely help us with our investigation.

84
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:24,600
I am Zheng Zhengxian

85
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,867
OK, I know.

86
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:31,633
The autopsy has been requested. Let's go.

87
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,667
She really doesn't hold back when she speaks.

88
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,667
Really indifferent

89
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,533
I don’t think…

90
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:49,267
Is she a little scary?

91
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,133
When she spoke

92
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,633
Eyes never blinked

93
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:54,667
It's like...

94
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:58,500
To make sure your lies are not discovered

95
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,133
You guys are really

96
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,867
People who deal with corpses every day
Of course it will be cold and scary

97
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:04,800
Will it be cheerful and lively?

98
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,733
What are you talking about?

99
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,033
sorry

100
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:12,333
They didn't mean that.

101
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,600
It's just that the atmosphere in our group is not very good right now.

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,200
I can't find any clues, but I still have to find a way to solve the case.

103
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,800
Everyone has become very sensitive

104
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,533
I understand

105
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,400
I really can't find the time to fix the car. It's really cold.

106
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:29,800
It doesn't matter

107
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,967
sorry

108
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,633
You must be frightened by the corpse.

109
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:41,200
Even though I perform autopsies every day and face corpses

110
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,400
-It would probably scare you too...
- I'm not afraid

111
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:47,033
He's dead anyway.

112
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,267
But you were wandering around outside alone in the early morning

113
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,300
Horrible accidents may happen

114
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,133
I know the case is related to your colleague, so you will be anxious.

115
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,200
But if you act alone, something bad will happen.

116
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,233
We too... must act as a group

117
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,800
Team Leader Zheng seems to have always been acting alone

118
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,467
Hey, why do you keep bringing up the past?

119
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,767
It's much better now.

120
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:20,567
Anyway, if something happens later

121
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,667
Just contact me directly

122
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:26,100
Just in case, this is for you

123
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,100
What's this

124
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,433
Well...

125
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,767
The murderer is a dangerous person

126
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:36,467
I am a little worried about the murder of forensic doctor Wu

127
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:38,500
I'm worried about you

128
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,667
I don't know if this kind of thing is useful.

129
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:45,700
Anyway, they would call the police only after meeting the murderer face to face.

130
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,467
I don't know what the meaning of this thing is

131
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,233
Or do you want a follower?
Following you 24 hours a day

132
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:57,933
This or follow me, you choose one.

133
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,633
At least it's better than nothing.

134
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,567
(Please help me!)

135
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:26,000
Let’s start collecting samples

136
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,600
(Zheng Yiying)

137
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,500
The cross section of the corpse shrinks inward and dries

138
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,033
For posthumous truncation

139
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,967
The entire left hand can be seen very deep

140
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:50,167
Active or passive defensive traces

141
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,767
There are signs of peeling from the wrist to the palm

142
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:03,233
Venous punctate bleeding

143
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:05,000
tweezers

144
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,567
There seems to be something in the mouth

145
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,033
Just look at the lens

146
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:29,500
How old is she?

147
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:31,533
7 years old?

148
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,633
I don't know

149
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,967
It's hard to judge the child's age.

150
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:44,367
In the oral cavity oropharyngeal airway

151
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:47,900
Found a piece of photo paper rolled into a cylinder

152
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:58,133
Width 8 cm Length 10 cm

153
00:10:58,133 --> 00:10:59,900
Confirmed as a photo

154
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,700
(Temporary store closure)

155
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,333
You must have been shocked.

156
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,567
The woman's white legs

157
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:48,633
Just blocking my door like this

158
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:50,633
I couldn't move at that moment

159
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:53,667
Frightened and fell to the ground

160
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,333
How could this happen?

161
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:00,133
Why don't you call the patrol to clean up?

162
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,067
Of course I called

163
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:07,167
But the lady upstairs in my house said

164
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:10,200
Nothing can be done until the forensics team arrives.

165
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,400
Come forward and stop us

166
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,967
No, we should first care about the people who are scared to death.

167
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:18,800
It's so cold-blooded.

168
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,433
No matter how I think about it,

169
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:21,900
That lady is a jinx.

170
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,967
What

171
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:26,133
It must be that lady who brought the ghost here.

172
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,800
Since she came to rent the house

173
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,300
I just think she's eerie and not right.

174
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,500
but…

175
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,200
Where is President Choi when such a big thing happened?

176
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,200
(Temporary store closure)
He should be back late today.

177
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Didn't he say he was going to the graves of his children and his wife?

178
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,067
Oh no

179
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:46,133
I'm too scared to live here anymore

180
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:12,000
(Danxiang Village)

181
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:27,333
That's my dad and sister.

182
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,167
The place where we lived together before

183
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:33,100
Our home is much better.

184
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,600
This must be the message from the criminal.

185
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,167
This serial killer loves to show off.

186
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:41,500
This means that the child is closely related to his crime.

187
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,867
Did you see the sea behind?

188
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:49,567
Wasn't sodium found in the soil in the last Li Yuanzhu case?

189
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:52,733
This means that the crime scene is a salty area.

190
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,433
Don't you think the clues are fitting together?

191
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,333
It's hard to say

192
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,633
Didn't Li Yuanzhu's body get found?
Cleaner and brush?

193
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:02,900
The cleaning agent was also found in the body of Wu the forensic doctor.

194
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:06,533
Seeing this reminded me of something.

195
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:08,967
That was a case I reported when I was a student.

196
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:13,100
The "Blue Bucket Case" occurred in Qingyun Port in 1999

197
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,367
When cleaning or pickling

198
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:17,667
Don't we all use that blue plastic bucket?

199
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,833
Body parts that had been brushed with detergent were found inside.

200
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,533
What did the criminal use to brush?

201
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:24,367
A brush, of course.

202
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,400
What do you think?

203
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,167
At first glance, it does sound a bit like

204
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,933
But it still seems too far-fetched.

205
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:37,167
And there was no clue found in that case.

206
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:42,067
It is true.

207
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:44,433
Also correct

208
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:48,267
A drug called Pavlon was also found in that case.

209
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:57,133
If drugs with similar ingredients are also detected this time

210
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,767
We can combine the investigation with that case.

211
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,767
When will I receive the results?

212
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:04,767
DNA and drug test reports of photos

213
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,867
- Chief Rui
-What

214
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,500
The photo has traces of film cleaner being used to remove it

215
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Even if the DNA test

216
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,000
It's useless if there's no control group.

217
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,233
Accurate test results

218
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,567
Usually seven days

219
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:29,867
No, this is an emergency case.
Can't it be faster?

220
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,900
From preliminary inspection and collection to analysis

221
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
No matter how hard I work

222
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
At least four days

223
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,167
OK

224
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:42,567
I hope you can handle it as soon as possible.

225
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,300
There is currently no direct evidence

226
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,700
This photo may be a major clue

227
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:01,067
But I did say

228
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:04,533
Didn't you find any clues in the blue barrel incident?

229
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:12,067
I've looked before.

230
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:14,367
That case...

231
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,833
I also think there are similarities

232
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:05,433
this…

233
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:08,133
This is what I did

234
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,500
Do you want it?

235
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:05,567
(White Snow and Red Rose)

236
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:18,067
(3D simulation image restoration system)
Found a clue?

237
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:20,200
The child in the photo is the key clue

238
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,367
Even so, at this critical moment
Is it reasonable to search for missing children?

239
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:27,000
What about the investigation now?
Are you going to leave it alone?

240
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,833
That just extends the investigation.

241
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,067
Unidentified fingerprints found in the first two cases

242
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,033
It is also possible that they are underage children.

243
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,133
But the leader

244
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:36,467
Currently, whether it is adult women or missing children

245
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:38,567
There are too many to investigate.

246
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,000
How can we be enough with just the four of us?

247
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,533
If you want to investigate, you must first lock in the control group

248
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:45,067
So I thought about it

249
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:47,267
How about investigating the unsolved cases together?

250
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,100
There is an incident called "Blue Bucket Case"

251
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,300
It was a dismemberment case that happened in Qingyun Port in 1999.

252
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,333
Hello

253
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,867
Are you crazy?

254
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:59,033
The media is already watching
How can you criticize us?

255
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:01,533
You said you wanted to investigate missing children.
Even the unsolved case

256
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:03,833
But the prisoner used detergent to clean the body.

257
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,967
It is very similar to the method of dismembering a body along the joints...

258
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:07,367
It's so noisy

259
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:09,400
Adding staff

260
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,200
Can we discuss this after the simulated portrait comes out?

261
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,733
- End of meeting
-Section Chief

262
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,533
You really don't know how high the sky is. What are you talking about?

263
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,033
That's a hot potato.

264
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:22,933
hateful

265
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:25,400
-Don't do that...
-Don't stop me...

266
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,233
I'm not going to argue with him.

267
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,100
You have to convince him.

268
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,233
If he lets us do whatever we want, we'll all be doomed.

269
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,500
I know. I'll tell you later.

270
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,733
Be Cool

271
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,533
Damn

272
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,433
(Danxiang Village)
Looking back

273
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:52,000
We were really happy in Helong.

274
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,867
Actually, if it wasn't for Eun-seo's relationship

275
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,700
We should still be together now.

276

(Unidentified suspect: Godussen)
1999 Qingyungang Blue Barrel Dismemberment Murder Case

281
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:13,533
The only suspect at the time was Godussen

282
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:15,933
(Witness: Ms. Hyun Jin-sook, 43 years old)
Due to eyewitness testimony

283
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:19,733
He was the last person to be with the victim.

284
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,567
Police at a residence in Danhyang Village, Halong, South Chungcheong Province

285
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,567
Arrest him urgently

286
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:27,867
However, due to insufficient evidence, he was released after only two days in detention.

287
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:31,000
It was later discovered that the witness suffered from schizophrenia

288
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,733
Plus residents' complaints

289
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:34,733
Eventually he was removed from the suspect list.

How is the house?

299
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,833
Because you're coming, I repainted the whole place

300
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,500
You look more normal than I expected.

301
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,300
I have confirmed it with my own eyes

302
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,300
You fell down the hill.

303
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,600
Someone who picked herbs happened to save me.

304
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,233
Fortunately, I met him

305
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,700
It seems that the person who collects herbs

306
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,967

312
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,433
Your face was more beautiful before

313
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:07,733
The nose moved.

314
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:09,667
Why did you become like this?

315
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:13,867
My Shien used to have a round nose.

316
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,367

Just a name change

00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:31,600
You are my daughter, right?

322
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,000
You never treated me as a daughter. I was just an assistant.

323
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,467

As long as you change your mind

334

340
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:48,467
Give me a nod back

In the end, in this world...

342
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,367
Only I will love you with all my heart

343
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,367
Then you will agree to anything I ask.

344
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,300
certainly

345
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,467
I just want one thing now

346
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,933
What's up

347
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,333
I want to...

348
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,900
You go to hell

349
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:31,433
How dare you wield a knife at my father?

350
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:36,633
-Where
- This way

351
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,833

354
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:01,133
Did you lose your mind when you thought of Eun-seo?

355
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,267
That's right

356
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,000
I just want you to remember her.

357
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,467
Let you feel it thoroughly

358
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:09,433
How did she destroy you?

359
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,467
So what happened to Eun-seo?

360
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:21,967
Did you kill her?
