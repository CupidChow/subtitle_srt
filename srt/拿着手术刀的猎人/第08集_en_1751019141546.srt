1
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,110
What should I do? Does it hurt a lot?

2
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,700
I like it better

3
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,200
are you okay

4
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,960
That's ridiculous

5
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,420
What's good about it?

6
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,750
It's still this hot

7
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,680
You don't have to go on a business trip with dad.

8
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,180
why?

9
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,100
What do you do when you go on a business trip with your dad?

10
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,390
uh?

11
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,730
Don't say anything

12
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,480
why?

13
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,610
just

14
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,990
Because I don't want to do it

15
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,550
A skinny kid like this

16
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,390
Sitting in the trunk

17
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,640
I pulled the hem of the blanket

18
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,440
Skinny kid, accomplice kid?

19
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Are you talking about Godusam's daughter?

20
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,360
Eunseo Ko? No! Not her.

21
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,530
This is a different kid

22
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,530
Go Eun-seo

23
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,780
On the head, it's this short

24
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,370
There are horns sticking out here and there

25
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,750
Devilish base

26
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,750
Short, spiky hair

27
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,720
A bald head

28
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,700
Wow, what kind of information is that?

29
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,120
Oh, this is the Cheongun Port I told you about

30
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,420
No, no, please continue what you were doing, Team Leader.

31
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
I came to change my underwear for a bit.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,920
Whew

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,340
I feel really uncomfortable because I haven't changed my clothes for three days.

34
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,630
Oh, yes

35
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,300
ah

36
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,640
It's been two weeks since Changjin's brother came

37
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,640
yes

38
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,310
Yes? Sister-in-law, you couldn't go to the hospital.

39
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,230
Hospital?

40
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,480
If you are a team leader, please pay attention to your team members.

41
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,480
My senior's wife

42
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,030
Where does it hurt?

43
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,530
It's been quite some time since you were diagnosed with kidney cancer.

44
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,160
You had a transplant earlier this year.

45
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
The results are not very good

46
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,540
He was receiving dialysis three or four times a week.

47
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,750
Should I take care of the kids or my sister-in-law?

48
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,500
I'm going crazy because I have to work two shifts during that time.

49
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,920
In the eyes of the team leader

50
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,670
We are only focused on securing our seats

51
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,430
They may seem like pathetic guys, but

52
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,350
We also want to catch the culprit

53
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,260
We are trying to find our own way.

54
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,310
Our way

55
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,390
But the team leader keeps playing individually

56
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,560
If you do something wrong, Brother Changjin will take your clothes off.

57
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,980
Seok-woo, that bastard barely got his police officer badge

58
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,900
I'm about to collapse again

59
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,610
Is that so?

60
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,740
I didn't know

61
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,700
Oh, tsk, sorry, I talked too long.

62
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,040
I'll go

63
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,550
I

64
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,130
Senior

65
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,860
Hey, Seokwoo

66
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,490
yes

67
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,990
I have to stop by the hospital over there

68
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,700
Yeah, you go in first, okay?

69
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,000
Hey, Mr. Lee! Get up, ah ah, yeah, ah-yu

70
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,620
Oh my, that's surprising

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,840
What is it?

72
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,760
sorry

73
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,550
Oh my

74
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,890
Oh, it's not the team leader's fault that my wife is sick.

75
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,020
What are you sorry about?

76
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,020
Hyukgeun, this kid

77
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,930
The more I do that, the funnier I become, y'know?

78
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,100
No, I was short-sighted

79
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,360
A detective should never think that he or she is the only one who is good.

80
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,030
I know we have to collaborate, but I'm still anxious

81
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,110
I know

82
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,620
Wouldn't I have done the same thing when I was young?

83
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,240
I don't know if you can believe it or not

84
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,870
The manager did the same thing

85
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,660
The knife wielded by the murderer

86
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,960
Until I lost my partner

87
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,590
But

88
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,340
A sense of mission alone is not enough

89
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,550
It also requires some skill

90
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,680
If an obstacle appears, you have to go back and try again.

91
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,810
If you stand up to the wind, will it only break?

92
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,390
I waited, thinking it was the wind

93
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,730
I did that because I was worried a typhoon might come

94
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,360
If there are more victims

95
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,530
I think it would be difficult for me to handle it

96
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,280
that

97
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,620
The Blue Can incident that the team leader mentioned

98
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,660
That's the incident where my classmate took off his clothes.

99
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,410
If something goes wrong

100
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,920
Of course, there is no discipline or suspension.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,840
If you're unlucky, you'll end up collapsing.

102
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,130
Is that okay?

103
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,420
It doesn't matter

104
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,170
Anyway, I

105
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,760
I have no desire to get promoted

106
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,340
Oh, I don't know about that.

107
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,850
My goal is to reach retirement age

108
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,600
Having two children

109
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
yes

110
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,230
I did it all by myself

111
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,560
Never let any harm come to your seniors or teammates.

112
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,780
I will definitely take responsibility

113
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,740
But I won't turn it over easily either.

114
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
As the senior said, I also use my wits

115
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,910
I will definitely make a hole for you to escape through.

116
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,330
Oh my

117
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,870
Oh, please go and see it quickly.

118
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,330
I have to go on a date with my wife.

119
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,770
hello

120
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,980
Did you finish it well?

121
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,060
then

122
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,020
Who are you messing with?

123
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,940
It took some time though

124
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,320
That's right

125
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,740
The kid who was trying to kill me suddenly changed his attitude

126
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,360
From a father's perspective, he should get some insurance.

127
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,320
doesn't care

128
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,910
The fresher the evidence to plant, the better.

129
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,000
If you are identified as a suspect

130
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,210
Because I was going to deal with it before I got caught anyway

131
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,670
Yeah, yeah, dad thinks so too

132
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,050
If you make a suspect and then the police catch him,

133
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,420
It's useless

134
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,880
I'll tell you the place now, so come there.

135
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,800
No, I'll send you the location.

136
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,810
You take good care of Oh Min-ho's body.

137
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,740
'You didn't give permission'?

138
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,370
The team members are now trying to catch the suspect through the bus CCTV.

139
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,830
48 hour surveillance, search and rescue, what are you doing?

140
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,580
What the witness, this kid? Chief, I

141
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,750
No, no, leave it alone, leave it alone, you can hit me some more

142
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,130
You, that eyewitness testimony

143
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,630
Do you know how many kids have been stripped naked before you jump in?

144
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,170
Do you know that that guy has a history of mental illness or not?

145
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,840
I know, but how can you say something like that?

146
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,800
Because of you, you smart bastard, all our kids have to take off their clothes

147
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,930
Are you going to take responsibility then?

148
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,680
I also know what you mean, sir.

149
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,600
So I'm sorry

150
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,390
Why do you keep doing such a sorry thing, Inma?

151
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,980
Why, why, why!

152
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,940
Oh, kid, really, shit

153
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,860
Team Leader Jeong, please!

154
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,030
If you touch this, it's wrong

155
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,490
You're not the only one going to the goal, Inma

156
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,830
We're all fucked!

157
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,750
Team leader, I sent you the contact information and address of my colleague who investigated this case.

158
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,420
Try calling them and if they don't answer, try visiting their house.

159
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,540
Go

160
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,460
What are you doing now? Oh, sir.

161
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,590
Let's give it a try like the team leader said.

162
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,550
Blue Can This has a lot of overlap with our case.

163
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,840
Witness testimony at the time

164
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,010
There are many parts that are quite similar to the child in our photo.

165
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,140
This level of similarity is not common.

166
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,680
Hey! Why!

167
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,140
You fucking punk, stop what the kid wants to do, you little shit!

168
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,440
I always used polite language with my classmates

169
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,190
You fucking idiot, since when did you start feeling like a fucking old fart?

170
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,190
Oh, yes, sir

171
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,150
sorry

172
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,030
Hey, Inma! Stop it, Inma!

173
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,660
Oh, let go, kid.

174
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,120
Oh, what are you doing in front of Seok-woo?

175
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,790
Yes, Manager Yang

176
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,050
Oh, Team Leader Jeong, how have you been?

177
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,010
Oh, yes, that's okay.

178
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,720
What should I do, it's really hard

179
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,350
I don't know why this keeps happening in Yongcheonseo.

180
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,640
I have to catch the culprit quickly, but I'm embarrassed.

181
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,640
What is that

182
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,020
It's not just Team Leader Jeong's responsibility.

183
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,150
Manager Seo, I wish you had set up a temporary autopsy room there too.

184
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,650
I have to do my part

185
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,020
no

186
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,150
Just being there for me helps a lot

187
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,360
is it so?

188
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,370
In reality, there isn't much that Manager Seo can do alone.

189
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,740
But why

190
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,120
Oh, right

191
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,370
No, Manager Seo

192
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,290
Please call me as soon as the test results come out.

193
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,620
You're pestering someone so much and then you don't pick up the phone.

194
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,460
What else came out?

195
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,260
The third case drug results came out though

196
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,880
This time it's pancuronium

197
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,590
yes?

198
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,300
Is it pancuronium?

199
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,590
That's why

200
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,930
Because it also appeared in the first and second incidents

201
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,220
1st or 2nd?

202
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,890
You didn't know?

203
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,440
Oh, yes

204
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,100
No, no

205
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,060
Anyway, thank you

206
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,610
Oh, I'm just now

207
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,900
I have to go to a meeting, so I'll contact you again.

208
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,610
yes

209
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,900
You could just do it over the phone

210
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,070
You're busy, why are you coming all the way here?

211
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,870
While I was in Seoul, I stopped by for some investigation.

212
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,080
ah

213
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,080
I've been out of my mind lately

214
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,040
I deleted the email that Manager Seo sent me.

215
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,420
I can't even tell you that I didn't organize the documents properly.

216
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,380
I'm a little sorry and so

217
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,300
Well done

218
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,550
If you had told me, I would have probably worn a mask?

219
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,390
Our manager doesn't seem to have any filtering skills.

220
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,300
Oh, yes

221
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,010
Here you go, team leader

222
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,220
I will also resend it to you by email.

223
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,730
yes

224
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,240
'Pancuronium'

225
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,200
'Incapable of emotion'

226
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,100
Are you here?

227
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,350
This is the drug test report for the first and second incidents.

228
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,220
Oh, that

229
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,680
I have to give it to you

230
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,520
If the connection fails, it will be transferred to voicemail.

231
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,810
My daughter is just because of this

232
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,850
Are you saying this to your dad?

233
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,230
But you can't catch me with something like this

234
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,360
I reported the death last night.

235
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,400
Well, with a dead person

236
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,820
Are you going to make me a suspect?

237
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,410
It doesn't matter, I'm still alive

238
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,000
Just plant the evidence

239
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,910
Anyway, you'll just be found dead later.

240
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,750
Like that truck over there that you treat like a clone

241
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,710
Oh my, our Se-eun

242
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,550
You're really all grown up, you're all grown up

243
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,100
I know that look

244
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,390
When people are scared to the bone in front of you

245
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,400
Overdoing it to avoid being caught

246
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,030
Your expression right now

247
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,200
Don't you remember?

248
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,910
I don't remember, I don't remember, how could I forget that?

249
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,790
Sehyun-ah, Yoon Se-eun

250
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,250
You have to think carefully

251
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,550
If you keep doing this, you could lose your entire career.

252
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,670
Call me Se-Hyeon

253
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,430
You were a bit flustered

254
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,640
Oh, what are you talking about?

255
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,260
I'm saying this because I'm worried, huh?

256
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,650
well

257
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,980
Even if it takes

258
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,860
I think you'll sleep better than you'll live

259
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,660
How many times have I saved your life so far?

260
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,910
You should give me a chance too

261
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,450
hey

262
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,540
Are you really going to kill me?

263
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,750
You're doing this because you're scared.

264
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,540
You're acting scared to me right now, aren't you?

265
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,670
Hey, you're screwed, you little shit!

266
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,380
It's really noisy

267
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,640
Let's really end it now

268
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,830
Where are the car keys?

269
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,040
Where are the car keys!

270
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,660
madam

271
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,610
I hope it goes your way

272
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,490
Don't even dream

273
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,530
okay?

274
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,410
I

275
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,790
Even if I die

276
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,750
To our daughter

277
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,880
I'm going to die

278
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,590
I didn't think about it

279
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,260
It was so refreshing today

280
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,230
But I won't kill you

281
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,490
How much I care about you

282
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,780
still

283
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,540
You deserve to be punished

284
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,330
What's that over there!

285
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,970
Se-eun!

286
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,010
I have to go to dad!

287
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,170
Se-eun-ah! Se-eun-ah! Cross twice

288
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,630
Double vertical

289
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,340
You have to be a great person

290
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,930
I can't get scolded by my dad

291
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,220
How was your day?

292
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,140
Be honest with me

293
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,610
Wasn't it freaking good when you strangled your dad?

294
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,700
You can't get away from me

295
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,160
absoluteness

296
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,790
My baby

297
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,350
Se-eun, where are you going?

298
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,480
Se-eun, Se-eun!

299
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,770
Se-eun! You have to come to daddy.

300
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,440
You should come to dad, Yoon Se-eun!

301
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,320
Se-eun! Se-eun!

302
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,910
You can't get away from me

303
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,500
Where are you going?

304
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,670
Se-eun, I forgive you.

305
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,850
Manager Seo

306
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,660
are you okay?

307
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,170
Can you give me some toilet paper?

308
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,950
I was worried because I couldn't contact you and you didn't come to work.

309
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,160
Have you been very busy?

310
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,540
yes

311
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,580
yes

312
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,750
To avoid further injury

313
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,050
Please take it three times a day

314
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,560
Take a rest

315
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,400
I'll just summarize it and go.

316
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,830
I'm just sitting there because I'm out of my mind.

317
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,490
yes?

318
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,380
You can just stay still

319
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,930
Manager Seo

320
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,060
Sir, why did you become a medical examiner?

321
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,150
To reveal the truth

322
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,360
To prevent more victims

323
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,740
To the bereaved families

324
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,910
I hope this helps a little

325
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,080
I'm doing it

326
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,500
If you don't feel that way

327
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,170
This work

328
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,000
It would be hard to do

329
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,010
It's a bit of a stretch, but

330
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,180
When I was a teenager

331
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,430
I've been having a lot of accidents

332
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,430
It feels like I have no one on my side in this world

333
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,940
I was always very angry

334
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,810
One day

335
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,360
The store I often went to was robbed.

336
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,940
The police caught him

337
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,110
Don't ask

338
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,320
They say I'm the culprit without even hearing it

339
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,030
There is no CCTV around.

340
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,950
I was really going crazy

341
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,960
Even though I say it's not me

342
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,290
Nobody believed it

343
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,130
I'm going crazy because I'm so wronged

344
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
There is no way to prove it

345
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,930
I thought it was going to be like this

346
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,510
But suddenly

347
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,890
They told me to go home because they caught the real culprit.

348
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,470
I found out later

349
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,100
Because I feel so wronged

350
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,110
The captain of the police station who arrested me

351
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,570
You investigated alone

352
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,320
So I went there and asked

353
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,110
Why did you help me?

354
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,240
So do you know what he said?

355
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,540
'I told you with my eyes'

356
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,080
'Please help me'

357
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,830
and

358
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,210
How cool he looked back then

359
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,670
I decided that day

360
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,800
'I should become a police officer'

361
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,050
'So that no one is wronged'

362
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,010
'Let's become investigators who catch the real culprit'

363
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,230
That's what I'm saying

364
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,490
I have a question

365
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,740
The team leader is a good person

366
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,910
So don't support me

367
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,210
Don't give up, please

368
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,070
'Cheongun Port'
