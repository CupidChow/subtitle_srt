1
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,980
Did you find anything?

2
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,810
If that were the case, would I be sitting here now?

3
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,820
We'll have to wait and see the results

4
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,690
Why does this feel so strong?

5
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,530
Oh no, this is a big problem.

6
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,990
I know that student well because he is a regular at my house.

7
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,990
Even before the incident, the victim

8
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,410
I left my clothes here.

9
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,160
So, I went to deliver clothes and the house was empty so I took them

10
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,620
I've been disappointed many times

11
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,960
What's up lately

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,540
Have you seen any suspicious people around you?

13
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,420
Suspicious person?

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,210
Oh, but isn't this the old town's love room?

15
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,420
Oh, I should show you the picture.

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,130
Oh, there's a picture? Yes.

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,310
Well, if you look at it this way

18
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,940
I'm not sure about wearing a hat

19
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,400
Oh! By the way

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,860
I heard your sister-in-law was discharged from the hospital?

21
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,900
Wow, brother, I already heard the news here.

22
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,280
Oh, well, the surgery went well and I came home the day before yesterday.

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,740
That's so great, huh?

24
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,160
Kidney transplant surgery is not easy.

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,290
Yeah, you've had a hard time.

26
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,790
Oh my, oh my, what, what's the trouble I'm having?

27
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,290
Hey, you're calling

28
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,550
It's my brother's

29
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,600
Yes, team leader

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,260
Oh, now?

31
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,520
I'm exploring

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,430
Oh, yes

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,730
Okay, yes, then please call me when you arrive.

34
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,610
yes

35
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,940
He, the new team leader?

36
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,480
Shouldn't everyone go in and see it?

37
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,530
No, I went to Seoul in the morning to do an autopsy.

38
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,610
What did you say?

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,990
No, the coroner wants to see the scene himself.

40
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,950
He said to wait and come down together.

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
yes?

42
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,580
Anna, this is really fucking annoying, man.

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,330
Oh, are you some kind of detective? What the heck, who's coming?

44
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,420
Yes, I am Seo Se-Hyeon, a dog from the National Institute of Scientific Investigation.

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,840
He was notorious for having fun playing detective chief.

46
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,630
Anna, you really hit the nail on the head, man.

47
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,260
Because I said I hate you, I hate you

48
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,140
The autopsy doctor also came and picked out something similar, huh?

49
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,600
The wait is freezing, I'm just too busy exploring! Shit, tsk

50
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,810
Brother, turn off the phone.

51
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,980
Habits must be established at the beginning.

52
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,110
Is that so?

53
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,610
These people are going to get scolded by the team leader

54
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,860
turn off

55
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,330
Nam Seung-hyeop this

56
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,090
Is it that hard to deal with a simple assault rather than drugs?

57
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,590
Oh, if it becomes like this

58
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,880
Oh, what's the point of my reputation in front of the inspiration?

59
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,050
Don't worry

60
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,720
Mr. Oh, unconditionally until today

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,260
Because I said I would meet with Manager Seo and negotiate

62
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,850
Just wait a little bit

63
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,770
What makes you so relaxed?

64
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,600
Oh, you're misunderstanding me again.

65
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,690
When will I come again?

66
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,360
So, I'm personally taking care of everything like this.

67
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,860
When our senior received the gold badge

68
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,910
I want to make it flawless

69
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,160
Hey, right, tsk

70
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,460
Oh, but

71
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,880
Why don't you tell me not to grip too hard?

72
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,090
If you turn around and report the already twisted kid,

73
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,090
Oh, Mr. C

74
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,260
Chief Seo is a person who can do nothing but autopsy.

75
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,600
Besides, my transfer to the main office is just around the corner.

76
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,930
I guess he has that much insight, right?

77
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,810
Oh, Mr. Oh, call him once.

78
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Mr. Oh, I went down to Yongcheon with Manager Seo this morning.

79
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,360
Hey, again?

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,360
Hey, don't do that, I told you. Seriously.

81
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,800
Is the scene tidy?

82
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,050
No, it was left as it was when it was discovered.

83
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,380
But judging by the cleanliness of the scene, this probably isn't the first murder.

84
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,970
Why?

85
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,430
If it was the first murder, there would have been a great emotional disturbance.

86
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,560
Of course, the site is bound to become messy.

87
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,350
excuse me

88
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,440
These are the boots the culprit left behind.

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,320
The culprit changed into that and dumped the body.

90
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,650
No matter how well planned the abandonment was,

91
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,200
It's hard to be adept at using items found at the first murder scene.

92
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,080
You're pretty sharp.

93
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,830
Oh, actually I'm into criminal psychology

94
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,410
But isn't that a bit hasty?

95
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,330
If the criminal hadn't expected the mud,

96
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,500
Of course I needed different shoes.

97
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,920
ah

98
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,340
If you think about it with an answer in mind, you may be moving away from the truth.

99
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,190
The criminal's hands are all over the dissected body

100
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,990
A corpse left behind as if it were nothing in a clean scene

101
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,530
The criminal is skilled in everything from body disposal to abandonment.

102
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,830
This murder will not be the first.

103
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,710
If you wanted to hide it, you could have hidden it perfectly.

104
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,510
Why would they put the corpse on display here?

105
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,020
if

106
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,610
If you want someone to find it

107
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,490
To someone

108
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,330
If it's a message you send

109
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,700
Why is that

110
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,330
We're doing a soil test to make sure this is the actual murder site.

111
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,710
I want to check

112
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,670
Is the evidence list complete?

113
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,130
Still in progress

114
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,300
When the results come out, please send a list of evidence to this email address.

115
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,650
How do you plan to proceed with the investigation going forward?

116
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,780
Oh, that's

117
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,450
I know, detectives, you hate asking questions like this.

118
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,820
But this is my way

119
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,240
I will do it according to the principle.

120
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,250
First, we will investigate the area around the scene of the incident and the area around the victim.

121
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,540
In fact, there have been many reports of stalking recently.

122
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,580
The victim was one of them, so

123
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,420
I was thinking of digging that up first

124
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,670
I saw a dense scene with no evidence

125
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,220
I feel like it's closer to a planned crime than an accident.

126
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,800
I plan to go through the initial investigation step by step.

127
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,140
Should we rule out the suspect and go back to the beginning?

128
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,480
It's not that I won't investigate.

129
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,770
I'm going to look for a target

130
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,230
It has been revealed here and there in advance

131
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,780
I think it doesn't quite match the situation on the ground

132
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,190
I want to see the evidence collected.

133
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,740
Didn't you say that earlier?

134
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,950
If you decide on an answer, you may end up getting further from the truth.

135
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,330
What about CCTV?

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,410
Oh, yes

137
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,710
That's it anyway

138
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,710
As you can see

139
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,090
There is no such thing on this road now

140
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,670
What is that?

141
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,840
Oh, that's lighting up the road, so it's on the scene

142
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,760
There is no sign of bending over the body.

143
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,140
Then of course you used a big vehicle.

144
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,100
There are no tire marks of a specific vehicle around the scene.

145
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,060
I came by another route

146
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,520
Then it must have been captured on the CCTV at that intersection.

147
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,690
ah

148
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,780
yes

149
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,490
Yeah, that's right

150
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,490
When I checked the CCTV

151
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,080
There were a lot of taxis coming and going.

152
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,240
Well, since I'm already looking for it

153
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,660
I guess I'll have to check all the delivery vehicles.

154
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,210
Are you going straight away?

155
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,300
I will contact you as soon as the autopsy report comes out.

156
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
yes

157
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,800
Be careful when climbing up!

158
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,010
Let's have dinner together and go

159
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,480
Yes, sir

160
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,400
oh my

161
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,070
Oh, by the way, I didn't even realize my battery was dead while I was exploring.

162
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,070
Are you still at the scene?

163
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,780
Yeah, what

164
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,700
But where are you now?

165
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,570
Given the on-site situation, it may not be easy to obtain additional DNA.

166
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,860
First, let's at least identify the location of the crime.

167
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,530
I'm leaving the soil analysis that was just collected urgently

168
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,830
Are you listening?

169
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,000
Please pay, manager.

170
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,920
what?

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,460
It's Nam Seung-hyeop's case

172
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,460
I think I already answered that

173
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,800
If that's true then

174
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,680
I will send it directly to the director.

175
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,100
This is my case, which the director personally entrusted to me.

176
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,520
Why did the director assign that job to Mr. Oh?

177
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,020
Because the manager does not follow the rules

178
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,650
It must have come to me

179
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,530
It's not a cause, it's an opportunity.

180
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,030
Then it won't work?

181
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,490
Oh, to be honest

182
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,740
I will do it instead of the manager

183
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,580
Do you know how many slaps you've gotten from detectives?

184
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,410
I endured that time and now

185
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,500
I'm trying to become independent, so please help me.

186
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,710
What if it becomes a problem of trust in our organization?

187
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,920
The authenticity and trustworthiness of the autopsy

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,920
Well, these are all excuses

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,210
You're doing that because of the promotion.

190
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,050
really

191
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,800
Do I really have to go this far?

192
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,850
I've already made up my mind

193
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,390
Think about it until tomorrow

194
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,470
Please let me know

195
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,350
I don't do it

196
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,560
jeon

197
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,110
I will do it

198
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,120
A little bastard

199
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,440
There is no sign of bending over the body.

200
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,780
Then of course you used a big vehicle.

201
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,970
Yes, strong team Jeong Jeong-Hyeon

202
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,680
Team leader, I am reporter Kim Hyeong-su.

203
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,810
Yes, are you okay?

204
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,810
Yes, there isn't.

205
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,250
Oh, you're here?

206
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,330
Thank you for your hard work.

207
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,920
Is everything okay, Mom?

208
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,170
Yes, you were in good condition today.

209
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,880
Thank you always. Eat this when you go out.

210
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,840
Oh my, why are you always like this?

211
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,350
I will eat it with gratitude

212
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,510
yes

213
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,690
I won't stay still this time either

214
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,520
I'll sort it out by Monday

215
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,690
Manager Yang, please speak to the director carefully.

216
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,450
Yes, I will contact you again.

217
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,450
yes

218
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,990
Yes, come in, sir, yes.

219
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,670
what!

220
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,880
But who is your sister?

221
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,350
Mom, you're my daughter.

222
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,600
Seo Se-Hyeon

223
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,310
Don't you remember?

224
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,940
My mom is on my scalpel

225
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
I even engraved your initials on it

226
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,160
Sister, you are so pretty

227
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,330
Sister, you are a good person.

228
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,170
Mom is pretty too

229
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,680
Oh my, what a strange person

230
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,810
Why am I your sister's mom?

231
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,600
ouch

232
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,690
Oh, it hurts

233
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,670
Yes, this is Seo Se-Hyeon.

234
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,220
I was going to call you anyway because I saw you missed my call.

235
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,310
On the morning of the 7th in Yongcheon-si, Gyeonggi-do

236
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,730
The body of a woman in her 20s was found

237
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,520
The body was found

238
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,110
All organs except the stomach were gone.

239
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,610
In the cross section of the corpse

240
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,940
Traces of attempts to suture with ordinary household thread were detected.

241
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,860
It's shocking

242
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,780
The incident was reported on SNS

243
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,330
Also known as the 'Tailor Murder Case'

244
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,160
It's spreading rapidly

245
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,000
Along with the fact that the victim had reported stalking before his death

246
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,750
The Yongcheon Police Station in charge

247
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,670
As it became known that they had failed to arrest the stalking suspect,

248
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,340
Citizens' anxiety is growing

249
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,430
The police's initial response was inadequate.

250
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,890
Criticism is growing louder

251
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,850
As of now, there has been no progress in the investigation.

252
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,350
What a little kid!

253
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,520
Which kid leaked it to the press?

254
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
uh?

255
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,110
Jeong Jeong-hyeon, is that you?

256
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,060
It's not me

257
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,400
Anyway, let's find out what kind of guy he is!

258
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,610
I'll rip your mouth open, Mr. Lee.

259
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,160
What about Changjin?

260
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,950
Senior Changjin is still

261
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,280
Yes, that's it

262
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,950
Something urgent came up and I took my annual leave today.

263
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,080
Who cares?

264
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,460
Are you okay with it?

265
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,500
yes?

266
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,380
Sorry, oh my, I'm the team leader

267
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,970
Yeah, cool, cool

268
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,390
Fantastic guys, very

269
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,650
Oh, shit, seriously

270
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,730
Oh, the police station is in trouble. There really isn't a single quiet day.

271
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,150
Hey, team leader

272
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,860
But isn't that true?

273
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,200
What do you mean?

274
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,990
No, I heard you spoke to reporter Kim.

275
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,030
You said you've already checked everything?

276
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,700
I never talked about the incident

277
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,790
Yeah, yeah, well, I guess so.

278
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,500
But, the internal gunfire is a bit

279
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,210
Aren't you annoyed?

280
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,960
Is there any room inside to shoot?

281
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,800
You guys are ignoring me and doing whatever you want

282
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,010
As you wish?

283
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,430
Team leader, what is the attitude you are talking about now?

284
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,550
What's your attitude?

285
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,140
What, did I say something wrong?

286
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,970
And senior Changjin doesn't do that either

287
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,770
It's an emergency right now, so if something comes up

288
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,520
Report to me first?

289
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,730
Wow, shit, you're really going to do this

290
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,360
Okay, since we're on the subject, let's take off the rank badges and take a look.

291
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,240
Do you think it's possible that you're older than our Changjin hyung right now?

292
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,200
Dude, dude, fuck, you're out, stay still

293
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,030
He graduated from Kyunghee University and got the team leader position for free.

294
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,280
He is arrogant and doesn't even listen to what others say!

295
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,120
Oh, let's stop, okay? You're the only cop?

296
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,290
Are you the only one who thinks so great?

297
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,330
Oh, shit, let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see

298
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,210
Oh, what the hell is that guy swearing at? Kid

299
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,050
Okay, let go, let go, come on!

300
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,470
Oh, right

301
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,970
Ha, really

302
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,770
Oh, really, you're being rude to me when you're a rookie?

303
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,560
Just wait and see

304
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,520
I'm gonna make you cry soon, sir

305
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,310
My brother was wrong

306
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,360
Oh, you're right in labeling me a traitor without any evidence.

307
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,650
This kid is real

308
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,860
Hey, whose side are you on?

309
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,030
Brother, where is the convenience in this matter?

310
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,700
This kid, oh my, shit! Ah!

311
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,410
wait for a sec

312
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,870
Oh, brother, call me, brother Changjin

313
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,830
Yes, brother

314
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,620
Hey, hey, hey give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

315
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,080
Yes, brother, that, how, that

316
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,960
Sister-in-law, did your second surgery go well?

317
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,680
This is Jeong Jeong-hyeon. Are you very busy?

318
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,850
The team leader must be busier, right?

319
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,770
Oh, you saw the article.

320
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,890
I saw it

321
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,560
The chief asked if we had leaked it to the press.

322
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,560
It's a total mess

323
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,110
The atmosphere here is no joke because of that.

324
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,770
I'm also really broken

325
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,190
I think the investigation will progress if it is exposed to the media.

326
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,030
Hey, that's not true

327
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,240
Honestly, even if the media made a fuss,

328
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,280
Is this just provoking the criminal to do it one more time?

329
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,450
then

330
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,620
Just catch it when it appears

331
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,840
Is that easier said than done?

332
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,170
But why did you call?

333
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,380
Oh, yes

334
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,970
I was wondering if there was anything else that came out

335
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,890
Specimens and boots

336
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,430
There is nothing specifically checked on vinyl

337
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,350
The above contents result

338
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,410
Twice horizontally, twice vertically

339
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,410
The above contents result

340
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,250
Not yet

341
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,170
yes

342
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,670
Well, the same goes for drugs.

343
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,180
yes

344
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,220
I know you have a lot to check and are busy.

345
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,930
Could I ask you a favor?

346
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,470
Since there is no corner to follow

347
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,100
Waiting for the results feels like a million years

348
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,020
I'm really worried that we won't be able to catch the culprit if this continues.

349
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,730
I'll hang up first

350
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,610
Oh, that's a surprise, oops, tsk

351
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,950
What happened to the thing I asked you to investigate back then?

352
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,040
Are you talking about that mold?

353
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,710
Is that really from a corpse?

354
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,590
Anything else?

355
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,630
Honey, do you have any guesses?

356
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,800
It's not a guess, it's a reasonable suspicion.

357
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,300
therefore

358
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,390
We must share that reasonable doubt

359
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,480
I'll focus on that next time too

360
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,530
When I was in college

361
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,610
During the summer vacation of the first year of the department, we do an anatomy lab.

362
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,410
At that time, the cadaver assigned to our group

363
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,240
Is it because the medication wasn't fixed properly?

364
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,200
It was moldy

365
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,790
Once the dissection begins, it will take several weeks

366
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,040
I'm living by holding onto that one cadaver

367
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,580
The mold spreads differently every day.

368
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,170
So before I leave the dissection room every day

369
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,630
Pour disinfectant

370
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,430
I scrubbed the washing solo until it made a thumping sound.

371
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,260
then

372
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,680
A person with medical knowledge

373
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,600
Could he be a suspect?

374
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,890
Maybe it's the other way around

375
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,860
That's an ignorant way to do it.

376
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,730
I wash dishes with a washing brush and clean with a washing brush.

377
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,900
The body is just right for that person

378
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,990
That's what it means, I guess

379
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,700
Honey, this is really creepy

380
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,080
No, actually

381
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,750
From that mold

382
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,670
Plastic fragments were detected

383
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,340
Because it is a material that is widely used

384
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,840
It may be difficult to determine the exact purpose, but

385
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,090
Judging by the shape and thickness of the plastic piece,

386
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,340
The size of the washing brush is just right

387
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,430
Next time, let me know in advance if there's an angle, so I don't keep it to myself.

388
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,600
Thank you for checking the results quickly.

389
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,020
Hey, Mr. Oh, you didn't come to work today?

390
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,110
why?

391
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,360
Did you fight?

392
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,990
You fought

393
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,990
What's going on?

394
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,620
What are you hoping for?

395
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,040
What? Is this a kindergarten?

396
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,130
Don't come to work because you had a fight

397
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,090
The only thing you managed to salvage was a washing brush?

398
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,050
Oh my, I have no clues

399
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,140
Hey, is there anything coming out on the stalker side?

400
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,390
yes

401
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,140
That's it, not much to say yet

402
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,310
Oh my, what is this, let alone the suspect

403
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,030
I can't find the thing to chase after, oh my

404
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,650
sorry

405
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,860
so

406
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,740
How will the investigation proceed?

407
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,320
Yes, there is no sign of bending on the body.

408
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,790
Assuming that you were traveling in a large vehicle

409
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,700
Analyzing the intersection CCTV

410
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,330
Drivers who are caught behaving strangely in a truck or passenger vehicle

411
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,670
We plan to conduct an investigation focusing on cannon cars.

412
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,500
What about the three-way CCTV idea? Not a bad idea, right?

413
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,550
Of course we should look into it.

414
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,380
There's no point in dragging this out.

415
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,550
Arresting the suspect is the top priority, right?

416
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,850
yes!

417
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,850
ah

418
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,780
Where are you guys going?

419
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,440
yes?

420
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,320
Aren't you going to analyze the three-way CCTV?

421
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,650
ah

422
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,530
Well, I have to do it, I have to do it

423
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,200
Let's do it tomorrow, with a clear mind.

424
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,660
See you tomorrow

425
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,160
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

426
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,920
Come quickly

427
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,460
yes

428
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,980
That can't be true

429
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,620
I'm sure he died then
