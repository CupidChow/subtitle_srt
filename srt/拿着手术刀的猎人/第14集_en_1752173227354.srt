1
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,980
I am

2
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,940
He is a prime suspect in the Yongcheon serial murder case.

3
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,610
From 1999 to 2004

4
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,780
A total of six

5
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,320
The real culprit of the unsolved murder case

6
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,120
I am Yoon Jo-gyun's daughter.

7
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,870
And I

8
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,750
A total of 5 years, from the age of 5 to 10

9
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,630
If Yoon Jo-gyun commits murder, he disposes of the body.

10
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,510
Assisted in murder

11
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,680
During the time I spent with Yoon Jo-gyun in Ha-ryong

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,890
I wasn't even registered at birth

13
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,430
I didn't receive any education

14
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,680
Only moving between top trucks and containers

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,980
He washed and sewed up the dismembered body.

16
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,400
We just spent our days together

17
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,190
And during those five years, Yoon Jo-gyun

18
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,320
September 1999

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,320
In addition to the Blue Tong Dismemberment Murder Case in Cheongun Port,

20
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,780
Still unsolved

21
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,240
September 2000, Ancheon City Landfill

22
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,580
February 2001, Haeryeong Baekho Amusement Park

23
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,790
September 2003, Jinyang Cheonhaedo Pier

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,840
February 2004, Seol-am Mountain near Taean City

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,130
and

26
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,680
February 2004, Unsu Valley, Hamyeong-si

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,140
He committed five more murders in total.

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,560
Also, Yoon Jo-gyun

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,230
Not included in the unsolved case

30
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,980
He committed a total of seven more murders of men and women.

31
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,520
Seven bodies

32
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,150
All abandoned on the West Coast Expressway

33
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,610
I want to catch Yun Jo-gyun with my own hands

34
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,070
As a forensic scientist, you should not falsify emotional data.

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
It caused confusion in the investigation.

36
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,040
Because of that

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The investigator in charge

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,170
There was an incident where he was attacked

39
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,000
I would like to take this opportunity to

40
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,510
To the investigation team and the victims

41
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,090
I sincerely apologize

42
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,190
finally

43
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,200
There is a girl being held captive by Yoon Jo-gyun.

44
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,200
He's a kid who doesn't even reach my shoulders.

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,490
My name is Se-eun

46
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,870
I don't know the exact age, but

47
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,790
Estimated to be around ten years old

48
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,580
That child

49
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,210
please

50
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,460
I need to save you

51
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,050
Just like I did

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,050
The child has never been to school

53
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,590
I don't even know what a friend is

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,470
Only a murderer father

55
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,020
Sister

56
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,400
I thought my murderer father was my whole world

57
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,740
I am a living child

58
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,400
please

59
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,530
Riding a white top car

60
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,370
If you see a girl with messy hair,

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,160
please

62
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,870
Please report it

63
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,230
I'm truly so grateful

64
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,110
I'm really afraid that the team leader won't wake up

65
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,860
How worried I was

66
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,150
Brother Changjin was no joke either

67
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,440
Me too

68
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,030
It's the first time I've seen Changjin hyung like that

69
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,570
He, his hands were shaking like this

70
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,830
'Oh my, team leader, team leader'

71
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,080
When will I be back again

72
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,790
'Oh my, team leader, oh my, team leader'

73
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,670
When did I ever say that? You're exaggerating too much.

74
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,920
That's what happened, brother. You cried.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,090
This is real

76
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,010
Oh, by the way, did you see the press conference that Manager Seo held?

77
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,640
Yeah, but like now

78
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,430
In a situation where the whereabouts of him, Yoon Jo-gyun, are somewhat unknown

79
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,270
This is indeed Manager Seo

80
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,730
I don't know if this will be a profitable confession.

81
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,770
Rather, there is circumstantial evidence that the two are accomplices.

82
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,980
I guess it could be used, right?

83
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,270
In my childhood

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,650
As he has already confessed to helping Yoon Jo-gyun commit a crime,

85
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,360
There is a lot of room to see this as something the two of them had planned from the beginning.

86
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,820
The kidnapping of Yoon Jo-gyun

87
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,030
What if the show is trying to distract attention?

88
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,950
We can't rule out that possibility.

89
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,370
right

90
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,420
I think we also need to check the credibility of the confession.

91
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,460
Oh, but

92
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,040
There was also a malicious reaction that he was being emotionally exploited as a child.

93
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,800
It's rising so much

94
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,840
Hey, don't look at that

95
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,300
We must save that child.

96
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,890
If you see a girl with messy hair,

97
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,310
please

98
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,180
Please report it

99
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,440
still

100
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,240
It's because of the child

101
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,160
I'm sure it's true

102
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,580
That day

103
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,160
Manager Seo held the child's hand

104
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,460
I held on tight

105
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,520
Dad, the food is ready.

106
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,080
Where on earth did that unwell gentleman go?

107
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,620
So, huh?

108
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,120
What, the laundry shop and the house were just completely empty?

109
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,170
A gentleman who is soft and gentle

110
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,460
I was so surprised that I couldn't even come home.

111
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,710
Oh my, you are too, oh my, tsk

112
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,840
Hey, you'll come when the time comes, okay?

113
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm not going to keep the store closed for long, tsk

114
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,180
Now is not the time

115
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,480
It's cold outside, so you won't come here feeling even worse

116
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
I guess I should boil the oxtail in advance

117
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,020
Oh my, our president is really

118
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,150
Anyway, what President Choi loves is, oh my, yeah, yeah, yeah

119
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,320
I have to know, oh my, really

120
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,410
Breaking news

121
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,370
Seo Se-hyeon, the prime suspect in the recent Yongcheon serial murder case,

122
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,830
He made a shocking statement at a press conference.

123
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,830
This serial murder case has entered a new phase.

124
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,750
The police then arrested Yoon Jo-gyun.

125
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,420
The prime suspect in the Yongcheon serial murder case

126
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,510
Defined as Seo Se-hyeon's accomplice

127
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,720
Urgent public wanted notice

128
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,760
Yoon Jo-gyun has been

129
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,300
I used someone else's identity forged

130
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,220
Recently, he has been using a fake identity called Choi Min-guk.

131
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,810
It is said that he ran a laundry in Yongcheon.

132
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,350
Stabbing the police

133
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,690
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness!

134
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,730
Your Majesty? Come to your senses, Your Majesty, oh my.

135
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,820
Your Majesty!

136
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,110
Oh my, what is this, your Majesty!

137
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,240
Hey, if you're done, come quickly

138
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,830
You're a detective? What are you doing there?

139
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,160
Manager

140
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,910
Boy, where is there a hotter event than this right now?

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,500
Do you think they would put the culprit on the stand now that all the evidence has been revealed?

142
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,750
This is not bait right now, bait

143
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,340
Oh, don't you get the feeling?

144
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,840
Just wait and see, okay?

145
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,180
Rather than just playing around

146
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,930
This kind of thing is a much more profitable business.

147
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,220
Oh, anyway, I'll contact you again later, okay?

148
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,020
I'm hanging up, yeah, yeah

149
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,020
Oh my, you annoying human, really, oh my

150
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,030
Oh, I'll pass.

151
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,990
Okay, okay, come in, yeah

152
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,300
Oh, the argument that Manager Seo has been talking about so far

153
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,430
To prove that it is true

154
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,930
More direct evidence is needed

155
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,810
If there is evidence

156
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,600
Look for the white truck he was driving.

157
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,850
All corpse desecration

158
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,190
Because it all happened in the cargo hold of that truck.

159
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,230
I will take note

160
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,490
Thank you for your cooperation over a long period of time.

161
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,030
Hey, Manager

162
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,200
Have you figured out the whereabouts of Yoon Jo-gyun and his child?

163
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,870
As you are currently under investigation

164
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,500
I can't share any details about the incident.

165
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,760
But to find Yoon Jo-gyun and the child

166
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,630
I'm doing my best

167
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,590
Of course, we are also paying special attention to Manager Seo's safety.

168
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,890
no

169
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,180
Please keep the boundaries around me to a minimum.

170
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,850
What I want is not safety

171
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,650
Yoon Jo-gyun is the one who makes me come to him.

172
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,010
That's not just a watch

173
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,560
When you need help

174
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,480
It's a very special watch that can call someone.

175
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,360
Then who's coming? Dad?

176
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,610
The person you want to see the most

177
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,840
You were up?

178
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,260
How are you feeling?

179
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,680
It's time to move now

180
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,760
What is this? Are you working already?

181
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,270
Oh well, anyway, I told you to rest when you can.

182
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,730
Go

183
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,540
Okay, let's end the press conference here.

184
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,980
Go up

185
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,120
It's the 4th floor

186
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,600
From now on, I will allow interviews with Manager Seo Se-hyeon and Team Leader Jeong.

187
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,100
Just wait for now

188
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,350
All right

189
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,520
How are you feeling?

190
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,060
What about me

191
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,860
I'll recover soon though

192
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,070
This one?

193
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,410
It doesn't matter

194
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,370
If I could just catch that guy, this would be nothing

195
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,000
The watch I gave you

196
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,290
You said you wouldn't use it

197
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,290
Then we

198
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,590
I could have gotten it sooner

199
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,630
I gave it to him instead

200
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,590
This kid has a lot in common with me

201
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,430
I don't know if I'll use it or not

202
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,440
Oh, I saw this too

203
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,820
That's true

204
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,150
I thought Manager Jeon Seo was a genius since he was born.

205
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,490
But looking at this

206
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,200
Your dictation skills are about the same as mine

207
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,040
sorry

208
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,910
What are you sorry about?

209
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,290
The days written here

210
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,130
It was the happiest time

211
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,720
Se-eun!

212
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,010
Sister, you're here!

213
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,270
How to write letters, arithmetic, and even write a diary

214
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,070
I learned everything from my older sister

215
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,110
For me, who couldn't go out of the house

216
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,450
My sister was my only friend and everything

217
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,950
So what my sister does is

218
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,660
I wanted to follow everything

219
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,500
In my eyes, Eunseo is

220
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,210
It looked so shiny

221
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,350
And then little by little

222
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,720
I started to hate going on business trips with him.

223
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,600
I am changing

224
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,690
Of course he felt it too

225
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,810
I thought it was all because of my sister

226
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,360
Then one day

227
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,030
On my tenth birthday

228
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,950
My sister learned the meaning of business trip

229
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,160
My sister was shocked

230
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,000
He just ran away with me

231
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,330
But it didn't take long before he finally

232
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,050
I buried my sister in the mountain near my house

233
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,890
I lost consciousness next to him

234
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,430
At that moment when I was about to lose my breath

235
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,770
It was discovered by a hiker by chance.

236
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,820
After that, I met my mother at the orphanage I was assigned to.

237
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,360
If I think about it, I really

238
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,160
I was a lucky kid

239
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,630
The bacteria

240
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,590
I will never give up on you

241
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,800
I told you where I was

242
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,640
There will be a reaction in some way.

243
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,720
Than Yoon Jo-gyun

244
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,270
Are you more concerned about that child?

245
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,020
I have an older sister and a mother

246
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,990
That kid

247
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,820
There's no one there

248
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,820
This time absolutely

249
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,450
Don't try to solve it alone

250
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,960
I will be with you

251
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,560
Follow me

252
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,900
This time absolutely

253
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,730
Don't try to solve it alone

254
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,900
Manager Seo

255
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,150
Are you okay?

256
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,280
yes

257
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,450
I

258
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,700
Team Leader Jeong for a moment

259
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,890
What about Se-eun?

260
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,140
what?

261
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,770
Taking risks

262
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,770
Is that the first thing you say to a father who came to rescue his daughter?

263
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,190
Se-eun

264
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,110
Where are you?

265
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,070
At your press conference

266
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,240
He only talked about the Jeongmi incident

267
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,790
'Why did you do that?'

268
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,080
'ah'

269
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,080
'Our daughter'

270
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,460
'You sent me a signal.'

271
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,680
'Please save me'

272
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,480
Don't laugh, it makes me sick

273
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,610
Just tell me where Se-eun is

274
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,860
Down below, in the car

275
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,530
lie

276
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,950
If you go together, you'll understand

277
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,700
But there is something, right?

278
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,870
No matter how much the commander in chief instructs

279
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,040
Can we stay like this?

280
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,880
Hey, no problem

281
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,630
Please confirm Mr. Seo Se-Hyeon's return

282
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,010
Call Se-eun and tell her to come up.

283
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,480
You really think about Se-eun

284
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,480
But what should I do?

285
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,480
If you don't go with me now

286
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,320
Se-eun died

287
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,160
With your mom

288
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,200
You take a look around Team Leader Jeong's hospital room.

289
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,620
I went to the situation room and checked the CCTVâ€¦

290
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,460
Now is your last chance

291
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,970
Decide

292
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,820
What's going on?

293
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,820
Oh, so that's it

294
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,240
Hey, have you finished your work?

295
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,360
yes

296
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,790
Hey, come back quickly

297
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,300
Oh my, sir

298
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,890
Who the hell thought you couldn't get in if you blocked it?

299
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,140
No, at this point in time

300
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,310
What item is as great as the Seo Se-hyun interview?

301
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,980
They're all just a nuisance, really, shit, tsk

302
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,940
If you die here

303
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,320
A big fish is definitely caught

304
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,490
Oh my, I'm dying from exhaustion, dammit

305
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,790
Oh, sir, what

306
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,760
Come on, sir

307
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,210
If there is evidence

308
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,050
Look for the white truck he was driving.

309
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,010
All corpse desecration

310
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,720
Because it all happened in the cargo hold of that truck.

311
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,510
Based on the statement of Seo Se-hyeon, the results were confirmed

312
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,560
The first and second cases of the Yongcheon serial murders

313
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,020
The expected date and time of the incident

314
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,440
Seo Se-Hyeon's alibi has been confirmed

315
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,860
I passed the lie test too

316
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,610
So from now on

317
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,280
At the same time, we are searching for the whereabouts of Yoon Jo-gyun and his child.

318
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,610
Please make an effort to secure a top car.

319
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,740
He, the pharmacy escape route for several days

320
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,450
We searched for the truck through CCTV near the tollgate, but

321
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,750
Nothing is hanging

322
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,250
It looks like you used a license plate number that was reported stolen.

323
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,840
Chasing license plates doesn't seem to make much sense.

324
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,880
Then the search area becomes too wide.

325
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,920
Isn't it possible that they abandoned the truck and moved on?

326
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,760
I will never throw away my car.

327
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,810
That's not just any car

328
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,930
It's probably a clone of himself who's done all sorts of things.

329
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,690
These are the locations of the six unsolved cases that Seo Se-hyeon talked about.

330
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,650
All past events

331
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,530
Between Mujin and Ha-ryong

332
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,530
That is, it occurred along the West Coast Expressway.

333
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,240
If it's the west coast

334
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,410
Are you perhaps considering smuggling?

335
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,160
I think so too

336
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,790
And if so

337
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,460
here

338
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,710
In this area

339
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,290
There is a high probability that they are planning to smuggle

340
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,920
Then we go to the vicinity of Yeongpo

341
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,800
Let's investigate ship owners with a history of smuggling.

342
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,890
yes

343
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,680
Seo Se-hyeon will be discharged from the hospital in three days.

344
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,980
Then, you will be sent to the prosecution immediately with the arrest warrant.

345
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,480
Catch the virus within 72 hours

346
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,150
We need to secure evidence of the murder.

347
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,980
72 hours

348
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,570
Let me say it again

349
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,610
I don't have time

350
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,530
certainly

351
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,740
We need to catch Yoon Jo-gyun

352
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,940
Never go out of the house without your father's permission.

353
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,000
Oh, shit

354
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,340
Oh, where did that kid go?

355
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,090
Oh, did you notice and steal it?

356
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,840
Ha, sir

357
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,140
Hey! Over there, over there, over there

358
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,470
Didn't you see the person who got out of the car?

359
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,600
No, I haven't seen it.

360
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,740
Because of that

361
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,830
The investigator in charge

362
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,250
There was an incident where he was attacked

363
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,050
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the investigation team and the victims.

364
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,090
I sincerely apologize

365
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,470
And finally

366
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,180
A girl is being held captive by Yoon Jo-gyun.

367
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,940
He's a kid who can't even reach my shoulders

368
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,230
It's a calculation

369
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,190
I use the name Se-eun

370
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,030
I don't know the exact age, but

371
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,820
Estimated to be around ten years old

372
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,400
please

373
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,030
Riding a white top car

374
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,330
If you see a girl with messy hair,

375
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Please be sure to report it

376
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,460
Huh? Me

377
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,090
They say she's a girl of about ten years old.

378
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,670
Oh my, where did you go again?

379
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,090
The name is Yoon Se-eun and the height is about 120 to 130 cm.

380
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,760
Oh, I don't think I could have gone far, sir.

381
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,640
They say he has a thin body

382
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,680
There are people with bob cut styles around

383
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,550
uh?

384
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,560
Isn't that him?

385
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,430
okay

386
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,060
Got the number right, dude

387
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,940
Heaven help me, sir

388
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,230
It's 100 million, 100 million

389
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,280
If you don't go with me now

390
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,870
Se-eun died

391
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,240
With your mom

392
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,250
Now is your last chance

393
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,130
Decide

394
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,140
Se-eun-ah

395
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,470
Let's go home

396
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,770
Se-eun!

397
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,900
Se-eun, what's wrong?

398
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,690
Se-eun! Let's go! Se-eun, hurry!

399
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,950
Se-eun, come here!

400
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,610
Se-eun, hurry!

401
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,380
Se-eun-ah

402
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,300
I have to go to dad

403
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,900
I told you not to go too far outside, right?

404
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,110
Dad, don't do it

405
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,340
dad?

406
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,050
Where is dad?
