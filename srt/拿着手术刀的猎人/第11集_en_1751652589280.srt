1
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,000
evil!

2
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,600
Oh my, isn't that President Choi?

3
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,560
Oh, what should I do?

4
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,440
Oh my! Are family the only guardians?

5
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,230
In this neighborhood, I am the protector of President Choi! Get out of the way.

6
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,150
In a jiffy, let's go!

7
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,940
oh my!

8
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,450
Keep people out

9
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,370
Everyone stand back!

10
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,380
What happened?

11
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,340
From the syringe found at the scene

12
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,630
Seo Se-hyeon's fingerprints were detected

13
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,670
It's also a pancuronium drug.

14
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,180
It also matches with President Choi's statement that it was Manager Seo.

15
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,180
Oh, is this possible? Yes?

16
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Oh, the house is in such a state, if it falls over, it will fall right in front of you

17
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,280
Shoes with worn-out heels

18
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,040
It's similar to the footprints I saw back then

19
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,710
What is this?

20
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,880
There is no birth report record

21
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,010
Huh? That's right, really.

22
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,970
Before entering the orphanage on February 18, 2004

23
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,430
There are no records at all?

24
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,390
Isn't this the kid in the evidence over there?

25
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,060
So this kid is Manager Seo?

26
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,940
Did you all get one?

27
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,070
yes

28
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,980
Okay, everyone, pay attention.

29
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,320
Okay, the child in the evidence photo of the third incident

30
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,200
It turned out to be Seo Se-hyeon

31
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,540
And the fourth injection drug was pancuronium.

32
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,700
One Room Evidence No. 1 Ear Piece is the 3rd victim

33
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,870
Cell phone number 2 is the secondary victim

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,040
The contents of the blue container No. 3

35
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,670
Because it was finally confirmed that they were the 1st and 2nd victims

36
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,250
Identify Seo Se-hyeon as the culprit

37
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,170
Put a public wanted notice right now

38
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,130
No, you can't do that now.

39
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,260
It can get really hard to find

40
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,220
How are you going to catch it if you don't?

41
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,850
Even after going to a nursing home, they missed the suspect right in front of their eyes.

42
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,350
Yesterday, I visited the house of Godusam, the suspect in the Blue Tong incident.

43
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,190
These are footprints taken inside a container in the yard of Godusam's house.

44
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,360
And this is a photo of Seo Se-hyeon's shoes collected from a studio apartment.

45
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,030
Look

46
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,200
Sole pattern and paint traces here

47
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,750
All are the same

48
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,370
Oh, then Seo Se-hyeon recently

49
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,870
They say he was at Godusam's house

50
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,500
And the one next to Seo Se-hyeon's footprints

51
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,670
Unidentified footprints, presumed to be of a rounded knee

52
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,550
I'm not sure who it is yet though

53
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,840
At that time, Seo Se-hyeon

54
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,010
I'm sure I was with someone

55
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,510
So what you're saying is

56
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,930
Hey, you have an accomplice?

57
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,430
Yes, that's right.

58
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,770
I think Choi Min-guk is a strong candidate

59
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,310
yes?

60
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,440
Who is Choi Min-guk?

61
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,980
I am the president of Yongcheon Clean.

62
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,980
The laundry shop owner here?

63
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,110
yes

64
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,030
I've had similar feelings since the bus CCTV man

65
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,910
The point of contact for the 1st and 3rd incidents is also Min-guk Choi's laundry.

66
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,240
And cut off the leg

67
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,990
There are also signs of a bunion on the shoes I wear.

68
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,250
Wait a minute, just a moment ago

69
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,160
From the call history of Manager Seo Se-hyeon, after the second incident

70
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,290
It was discovered that he was in regular contact with the cannon phone.

71
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,880
This is the base station near Yongcheon and Cheongun

72
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,010
Hey, are you sure? Yes.

73
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,260
Why are you telling me that now? I saw it earlier.

74
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,930
Hey, be quiet, yikes, tsk

75
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,220
Sir, then the accomplice is now

76
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,850
It has now been confirmed that it is in our area.

77
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,350
wait for a sec

78
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,730
Okay, okay, okay, then

79
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,270
Is there any direct evidence that President Choi is an accomplice?

80
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,650
At least that cannon phone is CEO Choi's.

81
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,780
Those guys who missed the culprit, why are the meetings taking so long?

82
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,120
From now on, the Yongcheon murder case

83
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,750
We are conducting a joint investigation with the Gyeonggi Southern Provincial Police Agency's Violent Crime Investigation Unit.

84
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,550
I was appointed as the head of the joint investigation team for the Yongcheon serial murder case.

85
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,880
This is Hong Jin-woo, head of the Southern District Prosecutor's Office's criminal investigation division.

86
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,630
i look forward to

87
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,100
From now on, don't spit on Team Leader Hong's story.

88
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,350
Let's cooperate unconditionally with one mind and one purpose

89
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,690
We must arrest Seo Se-hyeon, the prime suspect.

90
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,120
Why do you sleep so much?

91
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,330
Let me go

92
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,800
Hey, solve this

93
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,300
Sister, are you good at this?

94
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,720
Dad is now teaching me to learn from my sister

95
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,100
If you let me go, I can teach you something or not

96
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,350
Sister, you practiced a lot too, right?

97
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,400
How much do I have to do to get good at it?

98
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,190
You can't do it like me

99
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,360
Why? I can do it.

100
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,940
Why do you want to be so good at it?

101
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,530
You have to be a great person

102
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,490
To do that, you have to practice and practice again.

103
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,740
My dad said so

104
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,040
That kind of thing doesn't make you a great person

105
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,080
Your dad lied

106
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,330
No, Dad doesn't lie!

107
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,290
You haven't even been to school.

108
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,340
Can you read a book?

109
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,510
School is boring, so you don't have to go.

110
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,010
But how do you know? Is it fun or not?

111
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,600
When I go to school, I read books, draw pictures, and sing songs.

112
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,560
I also went on a picnic with my friends

113
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,350
There are so many fun and good things

114
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,270
It's not fun at all

115
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,810
I can do it on my own, so I don't need to go to places like that.

116
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,730
Is that what your dad does too?

117
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,980
Why do you keep talking bad about my dad?

118
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,110
What does my sister know?

119
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,240
I study too, I know everything!

120
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,790
Hey, team leader, the real culprit is

121
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,040
Do you think it's Seo Se-Hyeon?

122
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,710
Even if you just look at the scene of the incident, it is true.

123
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,010
It was clean until the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd time

124
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,260
From then on, it suddenly became messy

125
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,390
All at once, as if they were screaming for someone to catch them.

126
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,390
The team leader said that Seo Se-hyeon was at the scene of the incident.

127
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,640
Do you think he's the kind of person who would leave evidence?

128
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,310
To be completely honest

129
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,440
Team leader, you know what kind of personality Seo Se-hyeon has, right?

130
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,980
Isn't it strange?

131
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,610
Seo Se-hyeon is the autopsy doctor in charge.

132
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,530
He's a criminal who even manipulated the results

133
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,450
That's why

134
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,820
Why, why are you suddenly doing this after trying so hard to hide it?

135
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,160
I can't believe it

136
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,450
Something is off

137
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,950
then

138
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,750
Shouldn't we also check the authenticity of the evidence?

139
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,000
In my opinion

140
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,170
Are you the one who's misaligned?

141
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,050
Senior Hong

142
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,970
You can't look at this case objectively.

143
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,220
Is it because of Seo Se-Hyeon?

144
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,390
yes?

145
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,640
What is that

146
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,850
I heard it from Manager Yang Jun-kyung

147
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,100
The emotional statement was manipulated

148
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,690
You said you already knew before the National Forensic Service's official document came out?

149
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,150
But why didn't you report it?

150
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,820
that

151
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,610
After checking with myself first

152
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,400
I saw you leaving Seo Se-hyeon's studio at dawn.

153
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,780
Some people have seen it

154
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,700
Team leader, that's it

155
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,830
Jeong Hyeon-ah

156
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,500
You'd better stay out of this investigation.

157
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,540
brother!

158
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,000
Return your ID and work cell phone.

159
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:55,920
Take a rest

160
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,420
Think again

161
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,550
Then you have the overall direction

162
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,470
You'll find out how far apart you are

163
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,600
That can't be done

164
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,970
This is a case where no suspect has ever been suspected.

165
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,100
But then it suddenly gets solved in an instant?

166
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,020
There is clearly an accomplice

167
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,650
It is also connected to the Cheongun Port unsolved incident that I mentioned earlier.

168
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,400
The place where the third evidence photo was taken is also the suspect in that case, Ko Du-sam.

169
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
I'm done talking

170
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,860
If you don't want to be punished more severely, do as you are told.

171
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,620
Huh? Team leader

172
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,120
Team leader! Team leader, team leader!

173
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,380
Hey, Jeong Jeong-hyeon!

174
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,500
hey

175
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,550
hey!

176
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,880
AC

177
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,840
Are you okay?

178
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,850
Hey, Jeong Jeong-hyeon! Hey!

179
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,570
Oh my, oh my

180
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,200
Are you really okay? Huh?

181
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,990
Yes, it's okay, Chairman.

182
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,080
Me, at the hospital too

183
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,490
Well, I'll see how it goes today or tomorrow

184
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,200
He told me to go home if it was okay.

185
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,330
Oh no

186
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,500
Yeah? I'm going to rest while I'm at it.

187
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,920
On the outside, the wounds are just shallow

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,050
That, what is that, that

189
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,760
Oh, trauma or something, something

190
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,680
There's something serious like that, right?

191
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,300
Me too, I'm scared these days

192
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,390
You can't sleep at night?

193
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,640
No, yeah, Mr. Choi, you weren't scared, were you? Yeah?

194
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,980
Oh, it was scary

195
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,980
Just that day

196
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,360
I lock eyes with that woman

197
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,610
He was laughing

198
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,740
Oh my, oh my, goosebumps, oh my

199
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,490
Oh my, really

200
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,660
Oh, that kind of person is just

201
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,830
We need to catch him and monitor him

202
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,660
I can't do anything weird, ugh

203
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,770
Family Relationships, Mother Seo Won-hee

204
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,100
Father, no brothers or sisters

205
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,400
No criminal record

206
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,860
Se-eun-ah

207
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,490
Let's go now

208
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,520
I would never do that

209
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,230
As your primary care physician

210
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,820
Are you medically sure?

211
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,320
Detective

212
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,280
Why do you think humans develop demonic tendencies?

213
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,540
That's the desire for recognition

214
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,410
The desire to be loved by people

215
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,000
Because it is not filled

216
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,500
especially

217
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,130
From my closest parents

218
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,420
The power would be enormous

219
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,510
But Sehyun

220
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,590
This is a child who grew up receiving lots of love from his mother.

221
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,180
I believe in that power

222
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,890
One day a nun came to see me.

223
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,350
I have a new child

224
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,900
Keep catching animals

225
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,820
They say they're going to cut open the ship and dismantle it.

226
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,530
And then it happened

227
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,780
I'm curious about what's soft in the stomach

228
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,250
But I'll sew it up nicely again.

229
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,590
I'll even build you a grave

230
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,880
It won't be easy, Sister.

231
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,970
The numbers are equivalent to those of a severe sociopath.

232
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,310
You can see that he has little sense of guilt and empathy.

233
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,810
still

234
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,440
It means that they will sew and build a grave for you.

235
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,400
I don't have any empathy at all

236
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,530
Isn't there no hesitation in killing?

237
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,820
That's because the child was surprised

238
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,660
Young

239
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,330
In this cold winter

240
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,040
Found unconscious in the woods

241
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,000
If the hikers hadn't noticed

242
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,420
Probably dead

243
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,010
If you are in such fear,

244
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:33,930
for a moment

245
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,430
Even so

246
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,300
Living with other children is dangerous

247
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,390
How about sending it to the facility?

248
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,850
Are you talking about a place like a hospital?

249
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,020
yes

250
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,400
By the way, teacher

251
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,150
Then next to that child

252
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,280
You'll be without anyone for the rest of your life

253
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,660
So you returned to secular life

254
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,870
I tried to dissuade him, but

255
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,920
There must be a reason why God sent the child to you.

256
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,510
I won't tell you anything after that

257
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,640
How great must that love and effort have been

258
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,720
I'll leave it to your imagination.

259
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,890
then

260
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,850
Are your symptoms getting better?

261
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,230
Childhood wounds don't heal so easily

262
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,230
I could go on forever

263
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,280
I'm just trying

264
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,360
Sehyun said

265
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,240
The nun was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

266
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,780
Let's save our seats

267
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,370
I've been living off energy bars for the past 5 years.

268
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,160
They say killing takes a lot of energy

269
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,580
Even if we do that

270
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,250
He was a boy who tried to keep his promise to his mother.

271
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,590
That kind of kid

272
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,050
Would you have committed such a heinous act?

273
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,070
Okay, eat this.

274
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,530
My dad bought it for me to eat, so I'll share it with you.

275
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,820
Weren't you angry at me?

276
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,450
My dad told me to be close with my sister.

277
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,330
Where is your father now?

278
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,290
Aren't you eating?

279
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,500
Where are you?

280
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,290
If you don't eat it, it's okay

281
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,890
Did your dad send you to school?

282
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,390
no

283
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,980
But how do you know?

284
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,770
What are you doing at school?

285
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,580
You can eat it

286
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,010
If you don't submit, it's rock paper scissors!

287
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,390
minus one

288
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,140
yes!

289
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,640
No, where do you get two?

290
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,850
♪ The flowers have bloomed ♪

291
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,070
♪ The Rose of Sharon has bloomed ♪

292
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,150
♪ The Rose of Sharon has bloomed ♪

293
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,650
♪ Rose of Sharon ♪

294
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,530
Gotcha! No way!

295
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,470
My sister told me

296
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,680
Sister, do you have an older sister?

297
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,430
huh

298
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,890
Where are you now?

299
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,100
well

300
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,570
I don't know

301
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,080
eat

302
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,700
If you let me go, I'll eat it.

303
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,210
are you okay

304
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,830
Anyway, the legs are still the same

305
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,840
Just let me go for a moment

306
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,720
I don't think so, I'll feed you.

307
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,720
Say 'Ah'

308
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,980
Chew it

309
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,620
I'll come back later when Dad comes.

310
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:31,430
During the investigation of the 4th and 5th incidents that occurred recently, suspects were identified.

311
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,850
For this reason, in order to quickly arrest

312
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,310
We have decided to publicly search for the suspect.

313
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,390
The name of the prime suspect in this case is

314
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,270
Seo Se-Hyeon

315
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,440
He is a former forensic scientist at the Seoul Institute of Scientific Investigation.

316
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,320
Age 31, Height 166cm

317
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,360
A brother with a slim body and a slender face

318
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,660
The hair length is medium length.

319
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,490
There is a possibility of possession of a weapon, so please be careful

320
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,540
Even if you find it, do not approach it.

321
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,120
Please report immediately

322
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,500
Have you identified the suspect's whereabouts?

323
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,580
What is this?

324
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,920
Has the motive for the murder been revealed?

325
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,500
Yes, regarding the part you asked about

326
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,920
The police are currently investigating.

327
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,600
As soon as the investigation is completed, we will make an official announcement.

328
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,930
I will try to answer you.

329
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,100
Oh, I'm going crazy

330
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,480
Since the initial mesh came out

331
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,730
I knew this would happen, why is this happening again?

332
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,810
Just where?

333
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,440
The forgery of the pancuronium certificate has now been explained.

334
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,490
I already have a terrible headache because of the Nam Seung-hyeop case.

335
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,070
Then you can reinvestigate it. What are you worried about?

336
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,490
What if we re-examine?

337
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,830
It's not us

338
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,620
The signature of Nam Seung-hyeop's drug test result

339
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,750
Manager Seo said it

340
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,130
No, is Seo Se-Hyeon helpful in this situation?

341
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,050
Okay

342
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,680
'The Reality of a Famous Forensic Doctor Blinded by Personal Interests'

343
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,890
'It turned out he was a murderer'

344
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,970
'He was a master of evidence manipulation'

345
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,560
Killing the headline, sir?

346
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,350
Breaking news

347
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,520
A prime suspect in the recent serial murder case in Yongcheon

348
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,280
Seo Se-hyeon, an autopsy specialist at the National Forensic Service, was named.

349
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,740
Wanted publicly

350
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,530
Police believe Mr. Seo is on the run.

351
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,160
To secure Mr. Seo's new recruits

352
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,990
I'm putting all my effort into it

353
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,120
Mr. Seo was revealed to the media as a suspect on the 19th.

354
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,370
Oh my, tsk

355
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,380
And he committed another attempted murder

356
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,340
He disappeared

357
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,840
Yeah, I see

358
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,010
Please check the shipping schedule for me.

359
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,930
A week later?

360
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,060
Oh, that's too late. Isn't there something a little faster?

361
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,690
Yeah, try your best

362
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,600
Two people

363
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,190
no

364
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,360
As an adult

365
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,900
Two people

366
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,030
Since you asked me what I think, I'll tell you.

367
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,580
I would never do that

368
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,370
Oh Min-ho

369
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,920
This is my team member

370
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,720
The team leader is a good person

371
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,260
So don't support me

372
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,720
Don't give up, please

373
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,810
But now I don't know

374
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,270
Can I trust the manager?

375
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,940
No matter what I say anyway

376
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,320
You won't believe me

377
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,940
Isn't it?

378
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,530
Good luck catching the culprit

379
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,700
Never again

380
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,660
Let's not look

381
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,010
Yes, sir

382
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,050
yes?

383
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,180
Who is alive?

384
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,280
You woke up just in time?

385
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,180
hmm

386
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,260
Dad, is this thickness enough?

387
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,100
You cut it so nicely, huh?

388
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,990
Should I show you something fun?

389
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,910
Look, this is really fun.

390
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,670
It was a bit creepy

391
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,300
I was also obsessed with dead bodies.

392
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,630
I was very interested in the police investigation.

393
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,800
And they even intervened openly

394
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,390
He was the number one person investigators avoided.

395
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,220
Because of the Nam Seung-hyeop incident

396
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,520
Oh, I had a lot of fights with Mr. Oh.

397
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:54,230
No, because Seo Se-hyeon kept trying to manipulate the evidence, Mr. Oh

398
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:58,190
As a result of conducting a comprehensive investigation into the cases handled by Seo Se-hyeon,

399
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,450
Also in the autopsy report of the Nam Seung-hyeop case

400
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,820
There was an individual's arbitrary manipulation of the autopsy report.

401
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,200
It turned out

402
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,660
To ensure that something like this never happens again

403
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:17,380
All humans are like that, huh?

404
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,840
In the world

405
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,670
You can only trust your dad, right? Okay?

406
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,430
Do you understand now?

407
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,890
Euig

408
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,220
hmm

409
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,110
What are you going to do now?

410
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,730
Is the fire done?

411
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,070
Se-eun-ah

412
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,320
Can you go to the car and get me some gas?

413
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,490
yes

414
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,870
What should I do? What should I do?

415
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,670
I have to start again, now

416
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,130
With family

417
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,050
Pentecost

418
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,010
I have to live well again

419
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,020
What about him?

420
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,600
I told you before

421
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,440
It's not cool at all

422
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,320
But still he

423
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,650
I think I like you a lot

424
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,200
Why do I need him when I have you?

425
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,660
He'll finish it off in no time

426
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,210
Let's go boating together tomorrow

427
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,800
don't worry

428
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,920
If you go out for a few days

429
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,930
As if it had never happened

430
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,050
It'll be quiet

431
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,970
Humans are originally

432
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,930
They are seeds that don't care about others.

433
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,160
They've all cut it out, humans

434
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,330
I warned you not to show your teeth?

435
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,370
Dad, huh?

436
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,080
You're not listening, are you?

437
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,210
Then you should be punished and come to your senses
