1
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,410
On this birthday

2
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,420
My sister will throw me a birthday party without telling dad.

3
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,130
Just roughly clean up this place with rocks

4
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,750
I'll wash it all tomorrow

5
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,720
Change your clothes and do it, if you jump in you'll stink

6
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,990
Okay, so I was attacked while I was sleeping.

7
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,280
Why did that woman show up and attack me again?

8
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,820
And you treated him?

9
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,990
Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's right! Yes?

10
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,870
How many times do I have to say this!

11
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,330
Okay, okay, look, look, okay?

12
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,840
It's all sewn up here, right?

13
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,130
wait for a sec

14
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,800
Is that woman really this woman?

15
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,090
Yes, that's right

16
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,890
That's right, that's right!

17
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,720
But why didn't you report it right away?

18
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,720
How is it?

19
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,730
They say if you don't want to die, hide for a week.

20
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,150
Oh, I told you that if you didn't listen, I was going to kill you.

21
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,650
If you don't want to die

22
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,450
Been hiding for a week

23
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,410
Do you remember who attacked first?

24
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,290
no

25
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,290
Oh, that happened so quickly

26
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,170
ah

27
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,670
What smell? What smell?

28
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,590
smell of rocks

29
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,300
That's right

30
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
It came out of my hand

31
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,970
I'm sleeping

32
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,260
Then that pungent smell of laxatives came in

33
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,020
I'm deep in here

34
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,520
Detective Se-Hyeon is talking

35
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,320
I've been living off energy bars for the past 5 years.

36
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,360
They say killing takes a lot of energy

37
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,660
Would a child like that commit such a heinous act?

38
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,330
You said you didn't believe me

39
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,250
But what else do you need to say?

40
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,510
What did Kwon Hyung-jo say?

41
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,840
Oh, things have gotten really funny.

42
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,550
They say there is someone else who attacked you

43
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,260
Seo Se-Hyeon actually gave her treatment?

44
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,810
then

45
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,890
In the first place, Manager Seo wasn't the culprit.

46
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,350
That's how it happens

47
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,150
I couldn't see his face, but he was a man.

48
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,280
You said your hands smelled like bleach?

49
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,700
Does it smell like rocks? Yes.

50
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,450
Surely it's as the team leader said

51
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,250
It seems more likely to be Choi Min-guk

52
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,540
And Seo Se-Hyeon for some reason

53
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,840
I already knew about Choi Min-guk's existence

54
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,050
He may be an accomplice

55
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,630
It might not be the case, considering he attacked Choi Min-guk.

56
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,720
Oh, of course

57
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,560
They may have conspired to confuse the investigation.

58
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,980
No, that won't be the case.

59
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,190
Oh, well, we'll find out if we investigate.

60
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,820
The problem is this

61
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,150
The team leader

62
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,740
It'll be very difficult to get the chief's approval.

63
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,950
With the public wanted list and Kang Soo-dae's presence

64
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,410
Hey

65
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,290
Oh, I wonder if Team Leader Hong could raise the flag a bit, right?

66
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,290
I will do it without your permission.

67
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,210
yes?

68
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,540
Senior

69
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,630
Please help me

70
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,130
Yongcheon Clean Laundry CEO Choi Min-guk

71
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,340
I said we should investigate him as a strong suspect.

72
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,720
therefore

73
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,100
You said you'd do it after Seo Se-hyeon caught it, but don't you understand?

74
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,020
Hey, what do you think, Team Leader Hong?

75
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,110
Just because it smelled like rocks

76
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,980
Choi Min-guk, the current victim of the 5th incident

77
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,900
Can't we just assume he's a suspect?

78
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,160
And I heard that he has a disability in his legs.

79
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
The suspect in the CCTV of the second bus

80
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,330
In the process of chasing the victim

81
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,250
showed normal gait

82
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,370
okay?

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,420
Oh, yeah, well, that's true

84
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,340
And the point of contact for the first and third victims is the laundry shop run by CEO Choi Min-guk.

85
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,170
Of course, it should be investigated

86
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,140
I understand that the investigation has already been conducted

87
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,970
Yes? Oh, yes

88
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,310
Oh, yeah, what

89
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,770
Because back then the situation was a bit different from now

90
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,810
No, I'm investigating the witness

91
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,400
Are you saying that it depends on the situation?

92
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,650
No, that's not it

93
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,480
No, but Team Leader Hong really talks strangely, huh?

94
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,030
No, so what are you saying is we've been messing around with the investigation until now?

95
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,490
It's noisy

96
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,990
What did you do to deserve raising your voice?

97
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,620
Team Leader Hong did all the work for me

98
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,580
Are you just having some free time?

99
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,750
You, Changjin

100
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,710
Go down to the traffic department right away starting today.

101
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,040
Hey, chief

102
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,630
Oh, that's a bit

103
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,590
Incidents keep happening

104
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,130
A kid who was just dragged around helplessly

105
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,220
Where are you talking about American products without any fear?

106
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,600
You're touching innocent civilians who have no connection to anything?

107
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,520
Go down and reflect before you take off your clothes.

108
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,600
Oh, brother!

109
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,900
What if you really go?

110
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,980
Oh, just hold on tight!

111
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,530
Even if I try to open the stomach, it'll just burst my stomach.

112
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,160
No, I can't. I'll just go and take it.

113
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,320
Just stand still

114
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,200
Oh, then, even knowing this unreasonable situation

115
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,620
Are you telling me to stay still, right now?

116
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,160
Hey, stay still

117
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,830
It's okay, I'll be back soon.

118
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,120
But Team Leader Jeong isn't here either

119
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,040
Oh, if you go too, my brother, our team will be completely torn in half.

120
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,340
kid

121
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,470
Me, that, Min-guk hyung, no

122
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,010
Min-guk Choi, are you giving up like this?

123
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,850
Why give up? We need to investigate.

124
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,430
Yes? Then, is there a big picture that you designed?

125
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
hey

126
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,230
Team Leader Jeong's personality

127
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,110
I'm sure I'll be able to hang on even if I'm alone

128
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,360
Shouldn't we help out a little bit too?

129
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,610
Oh, then of course we should go too.

130
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,860
You guys are out

131
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,160
This is ridiculous! Why are we missing out!

132
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,080
Hey, Inma, how long has it been since you joined the Power Team?

133
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,370
It just keeps growing

134
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,710
With my accumulated investigative know-how,

135
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,330
It can prolong life in an emergency, but

136
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,790
Hey, you're a human, you're just out

137
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,550
no way

138
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,340
Brother, you're not in a position to take such an adventure.

139
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,260
My sister-in-law seems to be feeling a little sick and is taking it easy.

140
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,050
This just won't pass, will it?

141
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,930
My brother's pension is at stake, so I'll just do it

142
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,600
My wife won't say anything

143
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,520
I've become a fan of Team Leader Jeong in the meantime

144
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,030
Hey, that kid, even in the midst of all that busy work

145
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,700
He took great care of my wife as she was in and out of the hospital room.

146
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,660
Go

147
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,240
I don't know what you're up to, brother.

148
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,620
I don't know about Seok-woo, but don't even dream of getting rid of me, okay?

149
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,290
Hey, what are you doing? Hey, I absolutely can't get off either.

150
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,130
Get on, brother! Let's go!

151
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,290
hey

152
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,590
Oh, this bird

153
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,840
Yes, sir

154
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,680
Where are you?

155
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,100
Oh, that's near the police station.

156
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,430
I also moved to the civil affairs office today!

157
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,640
Senior, is it because of me?

158
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,150
Yes! It's 100% because of the team leader.

159
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,440
So from now on, you have to listen to me.

160
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,360
Yes? Before Choi Min-guk was discharged from the hospital.

161
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,450
I'm thinking about robbing the laundry shop

162
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,240
Can you come now?

163
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,530
If you don't come, it's a betrayal, a betrayal! Team leader, you must come!

164
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,450
Almost there now!

165
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,910
I'm really upset, if you don't come for a long time!

166
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,140
Have you finished the discharge procedures? Oh, yes.

167
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,470
Come visit our laundry shop later.

168
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,770
I take responsibility

169
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,850
We will definitely give a 30% discount to our nurses.

170
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,230
Oh my, really?

171
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,020
Oh, yes, please spread the word.

172
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,630
But senior

173
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,040
Is it okay for the civil affairs office seat to remain empty?

174
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,880
Oh, what, what is it, what

175
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,300
Isn't lunch time an excuse?

176
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,510
sorry

177
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,890
For no reason because of me

178
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,970
Hey, stop it!

179
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,140
Brother, look here.

180
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,730
It looks like a girl's room

181
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,150
But didn't you say that Choi Min-guk's daughter died?

182
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,240
container

183
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,490
Right?

184
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,170
What the heck?

185
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,160
hey

186
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,830
There aren't any fingerprints?

187
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,750
Oh, how could that be possible without deliberately erasing it?

188
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,000
Team leader

189
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,250
Choi Min-guk has appeared, Choi Min-guk

190
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,300
Come, come

191
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,170
Please give me some time

192
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,600
Brother, I'm surprised

193
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,360
Hey, are you discharged from the hospital already?

194
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,030
Yeah ah

195
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
what

196
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,490
There was no serious injury

197
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,880
Me, brother

198
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,250
He, he returned to the scene of the incident so quickly

199
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,090
Is the doctor okay?

200
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,340
Yes? That

201
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,300
Post-traumatic stress disorder? Well, there's something like that.

202
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,760
You've been through such a hard time here, yes

203
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,970
Just, the events of that day just came to mind, yeah

204
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,100
It's annoying

205
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,440
are you okay

206
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,400
Oh, I see

207
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,150
Detective Park

208
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,960
You're talking a bit too long today.

209
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,920
ah

210
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,210
Me?

211
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,680
Huh? Huh, bro, just a minute

212
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,100
Yes, brother

213
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,520
Oh, yes, I will go now.

214
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,560
Brother, I'll go first

215
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,560
Yes, brother, ah, yes, yes, yes

216
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,140
If you cut towards the inside of the blade, it will cut better.

217
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,520
No need to hurt your pride

218
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,360
When I was young too

219
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,780
My sister told me everything

220
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,280
I can do it by myself

221
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,920
But my dad said that

222
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,380
Sister, you said your sister killed you?

223
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,380
Sister, sister

224
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,210
Is that Eunseo?

225
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,230
I think I need to go to the hospital.

226
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,860
No, you have to stay here until dad comes.

227
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm in serious condition

228
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,740
Do you think your dad will just leave you alone if I do something wrong?

229
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,950
Just a moment

230
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,630
Do you know what that is?

231
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,170
It's a watch

232
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,130
That's not just a watch

233
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,470
When you need help

234
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,100
It's a very special watch that can call someone.

235
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,890
Oh, that's ridiculous

236
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,060
Don't you believe it?

237
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,560
Long press the big button next to it

238
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,110
The red button is floating

239
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,860
Just press that

240
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,900
then

241
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,360
Someone will come to save you.

242
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,160
Then who's coming? Dad?

243
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,910
at that time

244
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,290
The person you want to see the most

245
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,260
Look, that won't work.

246
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,060
That's because the battery is dead

247
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,020
If you pretend to charge your dad's phone

248
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,480
Oh, I know what it is

249
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,150
This is where you plug in the wire.

250
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,230
that's right

251
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,900
You're smart

252
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,990
Sister, sister!

253
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,630
Yes, this is Choi Min-guk.

254
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,040
Hello, this is Mr. Choi from Yongcheonseo Joint Team.

255
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,920
Oh, yes, hello

256
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,960
Yes, but why

257
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,590
Yes, nothing else

258
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,260
Uh, we're in this attack

259
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,760
I would like to conduct a reference investigation.

260
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,970
I'm sorry, but you're still recovering.

261
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,560
Would you be able to visit today?

262
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,560
Oh, oh, yes

263
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,850
Or to where we are

264
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,480
Oh, I have to go.

265
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,230
Yes, everyone is working hard day and night

266
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,320
See you later then

267
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,480
Yes, yes, I understand.

268
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,440
Then I will come to you within an hour.

269
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,360
yes

270
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,740
Those idiots

271
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,700
Investigate for a hundred days, day and night

272
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,160
Sister

273
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,790
are you okay?

274
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,420
Sister

275
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,670
Sister, are you okay?

276
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,880
Hey ah

277
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,090
It's me, sir

278
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,680
Did something come out?

279
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,430
Um, that's it

280
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,600
yesterday

281
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,100
Did you deposit the car rental fee?

282
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,190
Rental car?

283
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,480
No, why did the gentleman in the hospital rent it?

284
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,980
Is it suspicious?

285
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,160
Rental car number not confirmed?

286
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Hand over

287
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,830
Brother Changjin

288
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,410
Can I get CCTV there?

289
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,590
The car that Choi Min-guk rented just passed through Yongcheon IC.

290
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,540
I'm still tracking it

291
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,460
I will share it with you as soon as I confirm the location.

292
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,010
Take the highway first

293
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,770
"72 hours"

294
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,830
dad

295
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,960
How are you, sister?

296
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,750
I need to go to the hospital

297
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,520
To go on a boat by the appointed time

298
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,350
I have to leave right now

299
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,270
Where are we going?

300
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,110
Sister, you take care of it yourself

301
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,200
dad

302
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,420
dad

303
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,470
I'm so sick

304
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,880
'87 weeks 6890'

305
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,300
Senior, please check 6890 in 87 weeks

306
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,050
Diazepam

307
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,720
Amoxicillin

308
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,390
Oxycodone

309
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,720
please

310
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,730
It has to be these drugs

311
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,650
Got it?

312
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,750
Did you hear from your sister that you should buy some medicine?

313
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,410
Yes, I wrote it all down here.

314
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,090
You go and come back

315
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,380
Dad will take care of my sister

316
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,730
Come here

317
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,860
Just hold on a little longer

318
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,160
Dad's hands are healing hands

319
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,290
Dad's hands are healing hands

320
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:31,920
Yes, sir

321
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,550
Yes, I checked and it's 6890 at 87 weeks.

322
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,800
It was a vehicle number that had been reported stolen.

323
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,600
I found it. I'll take a picture of the location.

324
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,930
We're almost there now

325
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,020
Please wait a moment

326
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,190
Hey, team leader!

327
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,400
No matter what happens, never move alone.

328
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,440
You knew it, right?

329
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,800
Why don't you just come in with money?

330
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,510
That's what my sister wrote down

331
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,060
You need a prescription to buy it

332
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,860
What kind of medicine is it?

333
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,690
Open your hands

334
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,070
Hurry up!

335
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,090
dad

336
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,470
Show me your scars

337
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,470
Could you please buy me some first aid supplies?

338
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,750
Hey, team leader!

339
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,580
No matter what happens, never move alone.

340
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,590
You knew it, right?

341
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Yes, welcome

342
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,390
Oh, yes, hello

343
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,310
Oh, yes, well, what would you like?

344
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,520
Oh, yes

345
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,810
My daughter got hurt a little bit, so mom

346
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,480
Oh my, oh my, what happened

347
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,690
no

348
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,780
But this isn't something you should come to the pharmacy for.

349
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,110
I think you should go to the hospital.

350
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,240
My daughter is a doctor, a doctor

351
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,200
No, still

352
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,040
I think you should go to the hospital.

353
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,200
it's okay

354
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,960
Because we only do basic treatment before going to the hospital

355
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,960
Anti-inflammatory pain reliever and wound ointment

356
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,840
Just give me a compression bandage and gauze.

357
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,090
Oh, yes

358
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,550
wait a minute

359
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,150
here

360
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,900
How much is it?

361
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,440
Yes, it's 8 thousand won.

362
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,490
Here it is, here it is

363
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,450
Yes, just a moment, yes

364
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,960
Dad! Dad!

365
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,340
Se-eun-ah, Se-eun-ah

366
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,050
Dad! Call the police right away!

367
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,720
Dad! Dad! Se-eun, Se-eun

368
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,930
