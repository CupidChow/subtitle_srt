1
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,670
Come out, come out, fuck!

2
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,339
What the heck, get out of the way!

3
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,624
Manager

4
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,501
We need to collect the evidence now.

5
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,586
I think you should give me back my knife.

6
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,672
Anyway, I'll wrap it in something and stab it

7
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,757
Nothing will come out of here

8
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,217
Hey, Chief, Carl

9
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,178
oh my

10
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,389
I contacted you to say I was sending you the body for autopsy.

11
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,015
How, you came in person

12
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,600
I stopped by on the way.

13
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,227
Hey, anyway

14
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,396
Just passion

15
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,817
The victim is Nam Seung-hyeop

16
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,361
29 years old, professional baseball player

17
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,698
I was attacked defenselessly at 2am today.

18
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,243
An open space where many people gather

19
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,912
A sword swung without hesitation

20
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,706
The criminal is impulsive

21
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,791
I feel no fear at all

22
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,836
Was it really necessary to stab him all the way to the neck?

23
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,212
yes?

24
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,798
You probably already knew you were going to die anyway

25
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,343
Well, then it could be an incident caused by resentment.

26
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,347
Did you enjoy it?

27
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,601
The stabbing speed is slow

28
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,396
There is a unique sound when a person dies.

29
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,524
For this knife

30
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,110
I can feel it through my hands

31
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,030
I bet you enjoyed that feeling

32
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,492
Well, that's cruel.

33
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,620
But how do you know that?

34
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,917
I heard it from someone before

35
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,045
Anyway, in this case

36
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,797
drunk on drugs or

37
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,673
Or a psychopath

38
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,803
Well, in that room anyway

39
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,931
We are investigating a few drug dealers.

40
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,724
Ah, let go of this! Ah!

41
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,935
Do you know who my dad is? Oh, yes.

42
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,228
Oh, I touched it!

43
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,521
Oh, my legs hurt!

44
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,730
Wake up, you little shit, get up

45
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,273
Let go, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck

46
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,858
I see

47
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,152
Excessive self-defense and aggression

48
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,863
Oh, it's dangerous, okay? Get out quickly.

49
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,324
You're not the kind of guy who'd kill anyone, kid, let go!

50
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,035
Don't come, put down your sword, Inma

51
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,830
Get down, get down, see, hey, hey don't come

52
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,414
Try again

53
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,332
seed

54
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,917
No

55
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,672
You have to hold it like this

56
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,967
If you catch it like that, you won't be able to kill even one baby bug.

57
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,053
Hey kid!

58
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,780
Do you want to try and catch it?

59
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,834
I'm sure he's on drugs

60
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,503
Don't be shaken in this situation

61
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,755
On a bloody knife

62
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,550
Those eyes are rather happy

63
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,681
Is this yours?

64
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,058
What the fuck, Mr. Lee

65
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,943
Blood-stained clothes were found in the bathroom.

66
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,570
Check it out, yes, team leader.

67
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,740
This is that kid's

68
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,702
Take him in! Yes!

69
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,746
Boy, what the fuck

70
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,272
Oh, that's weird

71
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,857
It's definitely on

72
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,859
Why the wind

73
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,070
That's broken

74
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,326
What are you doing in a car with no heater?

75
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,079
No, but I received simple stalking from Yeocheong

76
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,872
Why do we have to go undercover?

77
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,167
It's not just stalking, this is already the third time.

78
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,379
They all have similar impressions and are clearly looking for a target.

79
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,880
This kind of kid should be caught in the wild. Oh no.

80
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,883
Oh my, it's so cold I can't stand it

81
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,261
I'm thinking of buying something hot, what about you, Team Leader?

82
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,888
Just stay in the car, no need

83
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,857
Oh, good

84
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,652
Whew

85
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,779
How did something like that roll in, really?

86
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,447
What a frustrating kid, ugh

87
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,006
Hey, stay still, ma'am

88
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,051
Wow, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

89
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,221
Ah, let go! Stay still, stay still.

90
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,764
Oh my!

91
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,558
What are you doing?

92
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,684
Come to work

93
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,269
Go in

94
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,606
No, this guy steals chocolate.

95
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,609
Chocolate? What are you going to do with it?

96
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,987
Oh, what should I do? I have to go to the West and contact my parents.

97
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,447
You're undercover right now

98
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,825
What is ambush, freezing to death

99
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,993
Oh, well, at Kyungdae

100
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,787
It looks like you've done something like having a criminal mentality.

101
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,164
The scene is different

102
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,415
That kid isn't coming

103
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,333
Ah, let me out!

104
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,210
So, are you protesting?

105
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,087
You're just talking

106
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,423
A needle thief becomes a cattle thief, yes?

107
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,717
These guys later become criminals

108
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,552
Violent crime, stabbing with a knife and all that.

109
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,471
Let me out, stay still! See?

110
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,514
Don't be so quick to judge

111
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,058
Even though I'm still young, I can still call him team leader

112
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,770
Have you ever raised a child? I raised two kids this size.

113
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,813
I'm not going to say anything, so get out of the way.

114
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,607
I do it my way

115
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,400
Hold on, ah, senior!

116
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,153
ah

117
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,613
kid

118
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,698
Hey, stay still

119
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,034
Sit down, sit down

120
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,911
ah

121
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,396
Hey, get out of the way!

122
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,861
Move, move! Move, move, sir!

123
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,238
Get out of the way! Mr.

124
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,880
madam!

125
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,204
Tell Manager Hong

126
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,124
The hit-and-run driver who committed suicide is not the culprit

127
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,626
Mr. Lee Sang-jun's signature

128
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,337
It is certain that cervical compression asphyxiation occurred

129
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,771
Mr. Lee Sangjun

130
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,108
Did you say there was an inheritance issue with your brother? Yes.

131
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,985
I told you to investigate from there.

132
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,237
Please give me the time and place to visit

133
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,615
Oh, sir, are you going to go again?

134
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,742
The detectives are so disgusted

135
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,006
Ah, Teacher Chun

136
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,717
Because there's a high chance that it's the callus culprit

137
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,177
I will be going to the genetic analysis department today

138
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,511
I'm going now anyway

139
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,055
I'll be back!

140
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,370
Nam Seung-hyeop

141
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,205
Haven't you had your drug test re-checked?

142
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,667
Oh, yes, not yet

143
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,751
why?

144
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,802
Request a re-examination today and ask for the results by tomorrow.

145
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,721
If not, then stretch out in front of the toxic chemistry department

146
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,398
Yes, author

147
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,609
Yes, I'm leaving now anyway

148
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,530
Oh my, you suck, man

149
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,073
hey

150
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,574
hey!

151
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,535
The chief said to just let the water flow quietly

152
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,203
Did you do it or not? You little punk.

153
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,579
sorry

154
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:09,872
Find the escape route and recapture the suspect.

155
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,916
Do you have any evidence that that kid is the culprit?

156
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,918
It is still in the cognitive investigation stage.

157
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,837
A man in his mid 170s, weighing 70kg

158
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,755
It was similar to the common testimony of the reporters.

159
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,301
Are there only one or two people with 70 out of 170 on the Yongcheon floor? Inma!

160
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,635
As soon as they saw us, they ran away.

161
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,846
We must secure your identity and evidence as quickly as possible.

162
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,847
Definitely something!

163
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,599
Yes, I will definitely catch it.

164
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,686
Wow, this kid is really

165
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,521
Can't you hear what I'm saying right now?

166
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,399
Hey, you get out. If you stay here, what will happen to me?

167
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,151
I think something's going to happen, so take this kid out.

168
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,277
Get out, you little shit.

169
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,320
Aha, right, really

170
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,905
Oh my

171
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,532
Oh, tsk

172
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,325
and

173
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,164
AC

174
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,957
Is it broken a lot?

175
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,252
Brother, did you have a nice trip?

176
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,839
Oh man, that damned tantrum is back again, yikes, tsk

177
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,342
Oh, I'm not adding fuel to the fire.

178
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,845
In that case, you should definitely say that you will hand it over again.

179
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,806
He said he would catch the long-distance runner and do it till the end.

180
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,391
Isn't that obvious?

181
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,726
Once you start something, you have to see it through to the end.

182
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,353
Hey, Team Leader, you said that earlier too.

183
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,189
It is still in the cognitive investigation stage

184
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,148
Oh, but why bother

185
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,823
By all means

186
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,701
Why do I have to fight with the manager?

187
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,995
Don't be impatient

188
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,831
Let's be a little more realistic, okay?

189
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:37,210
You can do this as much as you want, as much as you want

190
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:41,047
Dude, please send me home. My little brother is alone.

191
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,381
Did you contact his parents?

192
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,467
Yes, he doesn't have parents?

193
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,636
What about the guardian?

194
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,096
Well, I have a grandmother

195
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,640
Recently, I was hospitalized due to a fall accident.

196
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,974
Yes, not now

197
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,518
I checked and it was correct

198
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,228
I think the welfare department missed it

199
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,730
First of all, I have requested protection from the child protection center.

200
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,444
Oh, right

201
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,706
Oh, this person is really getting a lot of attention these days.

202
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,793
The chain of acid attacks targeting children

203
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,963
It was a great help in revealing the truth.

204
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,675
National Institute of Scientific Investigation, Seoul Institute of Scientific Investigation, Forensic Medicine Building

205
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,510
We have invited Manager Seo Se-Hyeon to this location.

206
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,262
Welcome, Manager

207
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,099
Yes, hello, this is Seo Se-hyeon.

208
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,600
Thank you for inviting me.

209
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,979
Mr. Choi, what's wrong?

210
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,647
Hey, Mr. Chairman, you're here?

211
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,483
I brought all the laundry I left home this morning.

212
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,862
I know, I was just bored

213
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,698
I wonder if President Choi has eaten

214
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,742
I said that the only person who takes care of me is our president.

215
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,661
It's good to know

216
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,745
But

217
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,332
Last time, Mr. Park from the Yongcheon Beauty Salon

218
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,876
Why did that girl get rejected again?

219
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,877
ah

220
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,296
Are you saying you didn't like me because I wasn't a young lady?

221
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,131
How about I lower my age a little?

222
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,425
Oh, why are you saying that?

223
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,135
You are more than enough for me

224
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:13,222
Am I qualified to say whether I like it or not?

225
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,141
What is CEO Choi doing?

226
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,727
I heard you even got the nickname of a real ghost.

227
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,770
Be honest, be handsome

228
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:23,441
I think I called it that because I liked anatomy class.

229
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,817
The women who are after President Choi

230
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,403
Do you know how many there are at the bottom of this Yongcheon stream?

231
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,323
The chairman is the only one who thinks that way

232
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,116
It's called a gonggeureugi, why?

233
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,451
Oh my

234
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,580
I guess they also use a slingshot when wrapping a corpse

235
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,749
My colleagues are familiar with Manager Seo's unique suture technique.

236
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,294
It's because of a kind of mourning habit.

237
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,712
You gave your testimony

238
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,339
Do you admit it?

239
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,301
I think it's a bit of an exaggeration

240
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,137
You got accepted to Seoul National University Medical School.

241
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,765
You were 17 years old, so

242
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,225
Oh, yes

243
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:01,145
I started school a little earlier than other people.

244
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:04,273
At the age of 21, he became the youngest person to pass the national medical exam.

245
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,108
After that, he worked as a forensic scientist.

246
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,444
You have contributed to uncovering the truth of numerous incidents.

247
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,707
Okay, this

248
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,296
Okay, that's it

249
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,309
If you don't want to eat it, give it to your little brother.

250
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,815
Open your eyes, Inma

251
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,733
I'm not giving it to you because I feel sorry for you

252
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,903
and

253
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,239
This is my brother's phone number.

254
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,241
If you need anything, please contact me anytime.

255
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,413
brother!

256
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,086
Why are you here?

257
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,297
My brother told me not to go out because it was dangerous.

258
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,008
You said you'd be here soon, so why are you here now?

259
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,343
How scared I was alone

260
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,554
Oh, sorry

261
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,685
Okay, this

262
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,147
Wow, this is delicious.

263
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,399
thank you for this food

264
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,446
Thank you

265
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:34,989
let's go

266
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,067
I knew it

267
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,491
miss

268
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,911
No, how many times do I have to tell you?

269
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,663
I told you not to give me food

270
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,458
Oh, if you keep doing that, you'll end up with stray cats

271
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,712
To do business

272
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,380
I'm bothered by it

273
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,883
I have countless

274
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,641
what?

275
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,686
Isn't that a dog?

276
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,531
Let's try this, shall we?

277
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:31,457
As the attending autopsy doctor, how did you feel at the time?

278
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,250
To find evidence

279
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,921
The face of the child sacrificed, unrecognizable

280
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,757
You must have looked at it every day

281
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,259
I think fear was the biggest thing

282
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,763
I'm afraid I won't be able to catch the culprit until the end

283
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,475
So I'm afraid that another child will be victimized.

284
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,899
I think fear was the biggest thing

285
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,194
I'm afraid I won't be able to catch the culprit until the end

286
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,240
So I'm afraid that another child will be victimized.

287
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,744
Here, this way, this way, this way, where?

288
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,679
oh my

289
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,229
Are you sure? You were the one who reported the last stalking incident?

290
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,314
I'm sure

291
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,483
Oh my, you look like you have a headache.

292
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,069
You should have just passed it on when you were told to. It was useless, dammit

293
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,239
Request an autopsy

294
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,492
Okay, yes, sir.

295
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,496
Oh, take Seok-woo with you

296
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,457
Secure the surrounding CCTV and track the criminal's movements.

297
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,084
yes

298
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,505
Senior, yes

299
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,924
Please apply for an autopsy warrant right now.

300
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:27,841
All right

301
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,637
Yes, bro, it's me

302
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,223
I have a favor to ask.

303
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,481
Thank you for your hard work.

304
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,817
Are you from Yongcheon? Yes.

305
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,777
This is Senior Inspector Jeong Jeong-hyeon from the Yongcheonseo Gangnam Team.

306
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,780
The team leader came alone without any subordinates.

307
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,323
I think you're being bullied

308
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,242
yes?

309
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,576
Just kidding, sit down.

310
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,245
Oh, yes

311
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,125
What is your relationship with Chief Hong Jin-woo of the Southern Youth Center?

312
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,710
You called me directly

313
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,128
He is my senior at school.

314
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,422
Hey, it's an honor to meet you in person.

315
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,632
I have seen all the events you have been active in.

316
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:12,428
Yeopyeong mass grave case Gilchang dismemberment murder case

317
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,054
In particular, this incident occurred in the Xi'an area

318
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,099
The hydrochloric acid serial terror attack was truly spectacular.

319
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,560
There was a 99% chance that it would remain unsolved.

320
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,853
The manager clearly knows the crime weapon

321
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,105
Okay, I'll just listen to that.

322
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,065
ah

323
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,151
Incident Record

324
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,570
Isn't that what you brought for me?

325
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,780
Oh, oh, yes

326
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,324
Here it is

327
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,457
We responded to a report at 4:47 this morning.

328
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,000
The scene of the incident was near the university.

329
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,044
It is also a place where nearby residents come and go frequently.

330
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,755
The condition of the corpse was so serious

331
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,549
Yeah, it says there's a lot of corruption.

332
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,760
The corruption is severe, but the problem is the destruction of the body.

333
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,429
It was so visible that it could be seen with the naked eye at the time of discovery.

334
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,722
It was very bad

335
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,682
Have you identified Ms. Lee Yeon-ju?

336
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,810
23 years old, 3rd year student in the Department of Public Administration at Yongcheon University

337
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,520
To prepare for the police civil service exam

338
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,481
I was on a one-year leave of absence

339
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,733
My hometown is Seoul, so I lived alone in Yongcheon.

340
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,070
I was an only child and didn't have a boyfriend or any close friends.

341
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,363
Estimated time of death: three days before

342
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,741
Traces of opening the body by external force confirmed

343
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,202
No clear cause of death due to insect damage

344
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,788
Do you have anything else to say?

345
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,248
doesn't exist

346
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,958
Oh, and

347
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,293
Near the open mark

348
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,796
It felt like something unidentified was slightly attached to me.

349
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:32,549
I'll check it out myself and decide.

350
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,093
Are you going to wait?

351
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,595
yes

352
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,223
Hey, Manager Seo

353
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,479
Please help me catch the culprit.

354
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,440
The scene is also strangely neatly organized.

355
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,026
Leaving only the top

356
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,861
It's also true that all the organs were taken out

357
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,404
Anyway, that body

358
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,366
There are more than one or two strange things

359
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:01,120
If it weren't so strange, I wouldn't even call it a corpse.

360
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,652
Should we take a picture first?

361
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,153
huh

362
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,494
Take a picture here too

363
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,789
Right eye enucleation

364
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,207
Maggot erosion

365
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,501
Compared to the corruption seen with the naked eye,

366
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,795
The maggots look a bit big though

367
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,173
First, check the time of death with maggots.

368
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,258
yes

369
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,265
Did you take all the pictures?

370
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,309
Yes, I took all the pictures

371
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,024
There are bleeding spots on the eyes, gums, and

372
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,779
Needle mark

373
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,032
Traces of drug injection

374
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:21,783
Mess

375
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,246
If you subdue the victim using drugs

376
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,582
The criminal's purpose is not murder itself.

377
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,385
Because it's clear that something was injected into the vein.

378
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,803
I took a drug test and yes

379
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,694
broke my neck

380
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,739
That too at once

381
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,745
Bleeding during blister incision

382
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,165
That's weird

383
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,459
Corruption is at this level and bleeding

384
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:18,173
As you can see, I broke the neck very quickly and accurately.

385
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,052
Fracture of the fifth cervical vertebra before death

386
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,178
yes

387
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,314
Smell it

388
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,070
This smells like rocks

389
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,991
I think it fits the locks

390
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,373
Who was at the scene?

391
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,416
I went out

392
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,084
What was the condition of the body at that time?

393
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,045
Sealed tightly with agricultural plastic

394
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,422
It was left as is

395
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,591
Vinyl has already been analyzed in the genetic analysis department.

396
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,843
Open it up

397
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,700
Manager

398
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,827
I think you should take a look here

399
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,460
Why is this

400
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,462
Is that true?
