Team Leader

28
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,280
I put the surveillance camera that captured the movement of Lee Won-joo and Oh Min-ho

29
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,910
I also got all the dashcam videos.

30
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,110

I'll confirm this.

33
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,640
Then I will go and confirm Li Yuanzhu's movement in Longchuan

34
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,140
and the situation on site

35
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,040
That's right

36
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Mostly the hat guys at the rice roll shop and the bus, right?

37
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,780
That's right

38
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,010
OK Got it

39
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,980

Ouch

45
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,640
Press it to lock.

46
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,910
Bed, TV, washing machine, everything is available

47
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,340
Just move in.

48
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,010
If you want to stay, I will tidy up the place.

49
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,140
Can I move in today?

50
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,680
Today right now?

51
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,880
It's not that I can't.

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,780
But I still have to re-paste the wallpaper and replace the curtains...

53
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,880
No more wallpaper and curtains.

54
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,210
Just change the door locks.

55
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,440
good

(Longchuan Police Station)
But is there something urgent for you?

57
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,110
Rui Shixian, that woman is really scary

58
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,010
Do anything to achieve your goal

59
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,440
She worked with Min-ho for five years but he changed so suddenly.

60
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,510
Why

61
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,940
Of course I'm afraid that Minho will leave.

62
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,610
She just wants to step on everyone to feel at ease

63
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,510
Minho works very hard

64
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,240
It was not easy to win a case

65
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,580
What is the case?

66
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,110
The Case of Nam Seung Hyup

67
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,510
Of course she's not happy.

68
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,980
But Min-ho still tries his best to do things well for the sake of the victim's family.

69
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,880
Anyway, I think Minho's death is because of her.

70
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,480
OK, I know.

71
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,540
I'll contact you if anything happens.

72
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,440
goodbye

73
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,140
what to do

74
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,240
Looks like I have to meet Chief Rico.

75
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,080
That's right.

76
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,410
But she said at the press conference that it was a serial murder case

77
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,010
Team leader Zheng is therefore in high spirits

78
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,580
This seems to be pouring cold water on him.

79
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,010
President is the best

80
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,110
Really

81
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,210
I heard that you like this dish the most, so I specially cooked it.

82
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,180

Even if the sirens sound all day

85
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,110
Will the prisoner jump out and say "I'm right here"?

86
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,110
At least there are police cars patrolling

87
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,780
I think it will make you feel more at ease.

88
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,580
There are a lot of dark corners around here.

89
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,080
There are no street lights.

90
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,980
Speaking of which, President Choi

91
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,480
I have something to ask of you.

92
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,740
Please tell me, President

93
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,380
Could you help me change the door lock on the third floor?

94
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,940
I've already bought new locks.

95
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,280
Is the house rented out?

96
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,940
Yes, I just came to see the house this morning.

97
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,580
Signed the contract immediately

98
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,680
Yeah, that's right

99
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,210
I heard he was a famous forensic doctor from Seoul.

100
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,640
She said she'd move in today.

101
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,880
But the door lock is broken.

102
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,180
That's right.

103
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,940
I just happened to have something to go out today

104
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,880
No matter how late it is, I will definitely change it today.

105
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,180
Please don't worry

106
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,910
Thank you so much

107
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,040
But where are you going?

108
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,110
tomorrow…

109
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,810
It's the anniversary of my wife and children's death.

110
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,340
Oh my god

111
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,080
Yes

112
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,810
Is that day coming again?

114
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,540
You must be very happy in heaven.

115
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,410
I've been watching it for three hours straight...

116
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,980
I didn't see Lee Won-joo anywhere except the rice roll shop

117
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,580

(Yeonsan-ro 13th Street anti-theft surveillance camera)

119
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,640
He got off the bus and behaved in much the same way, then disappeared.

120
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,610
Do you need to go over and take a look?

121

122

I see

124
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,340
The application for a temporary coroner's office has been approved.

125
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,540
So fast?

126
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,140
I'm going to check where Forensic Doctor Wu moved in Seoul

127
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,680

Arrived at the door of Wu the forensic doctor

185
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,410
This is a serial murder case.

186
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,280
It should also be related to the Li Yuanzhu case.

187
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,980
But it has not been found yet

188
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,810
The drug and DNA tests didn't show any other results.

189
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,380
From the corpse...

190
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,010
(A large amount of Pavlon components were detected)
A large amount of Pavlon was detected

191
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,040
Yes no

192
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,980
The man at the rice roll shop I mentioned earlier

193
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,640
Still a suspect

194
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,710
From the outside, the rice roll shop man

195
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,680
Looks a lot like this person now.

196
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,910
However, because of the precedent of the Quan Heng Dynasty

197
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,240
I plan to wait for the identification results before taking action.

198
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,480
When will the result come out?

199
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,580
If it's fast, it's today. The slowest might be tomorrow.

200
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,140
Back to the point

201
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,410
I'm pretty sure this guy has a geographical connection with Longchuan

202
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,080
How do you know?

203
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,910
I followed his route yesterday.

204
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,280
I watched dozens of surveillance cameras near bus stops.

205
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,510
But he wasn't photographed at all.

206
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,480
This means that he knows Longchuan's geographical location very well.

207
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,080
So I'm considering whether to issue a warrant for his arrest.

208
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,110
Do you mean a wanted warrant?

209
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,210
It's quite effective for this

210
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,880
Although we may not be able to see

211
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,640
But people who knew the suspect well could see his features.

212
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,310
In this case

213
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,680
He should have been more secretive before he was caught.

214
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,980
It is true

215
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,740
But if necessary, you still have to do it

216
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,510
It's Section Chief Yin

217
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,610
Drug test results for the second Wu forensic case are out

218
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,310
Are you talking about the Longchuan case?

219
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,810
Same as the first case

220
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,480
The second case of the body

221
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,610
The same amount of Pavlon was also detected.

222
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,380
I see

223
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,310
Any progress?

224
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,280
The drug test results for both cases are out.

225
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,240
good

226
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,610
But is this possible?

227
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,340
There are obvious marks of injection needles.

228
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,410
It is possible that it cannot be tested.

229
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,280
Especially the case of Li Yuanzhu

230
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,780
Seventy-two hours have passed since death.

231
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,980
Forensic doctor Wu was missing the neck part.

232
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,080
It is difficult to confirm whether there are injection marks

233
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,310
right

234
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,910
Although it is true

235
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,580
Wait a minute

236
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,540
Hello, I'm Zheng Zhengxian

237
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,640
Is it the same person?

238
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,840
Are you sure?

239
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,280
The reflection in the video of the rice roll shop is so severe that it is difficult to confirm...

240
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,380
good

241
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,440
good

242
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,540
I see

243
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,080
So I'm considering whether to issue a warrant for his arrest.

244
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,140
Is it the same person?

245
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,340
Are you sure?

246
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,810
I have to find him first

247
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,680
Definitely one step ahead

248
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,580
(Number not shown)

249
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,380
(Number not shown)

250
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,210
Shien

251
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,510
Have you forgotten your father's voice so quickly?

252
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,640
It's so sad.

253
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,780
There are only two of us in the world

254
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,380
Looking back

255
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,910
We were really happy in Helong.

256
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,210
Right

257
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,180
Actually, if it wasn't for Eun-seo's relationship

258
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,610
We should still be together now.

259
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,540
Where are you

260
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,340
My only daughter

261
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,380
Happy birthday

262
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,580
What's going on?

263
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,840
Are you so busy that you even forgot your birthday?

264
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,580
Remember?

265
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,910
When you were a child

266
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,710
Every time someone dies

267
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,140
You will wait for the shooting stars to streak across the night sky

268
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,540
Dad was then

269
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,640
I thought you were praying for those people to rest in a good place.

270
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,980
But one day

271
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,780
You said so

272
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,410
I hope it's not just birthdays and business trips.

273
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,280
If you could enjoy every day...

274
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,280
Fresh cream cake and rice rolls are good

275
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,910
You're actually praying for this

276
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,180
I didn't say it at the time

277
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,710
But Daddy is really sorry for you.

278
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,810
Then buy it for me now.

279
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,180
Do you want this?

280
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,810
You eat quickly

281
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,110
What do you want to do?

282
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,210
Is it revenge?

283
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,610
Revenge?

284
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,880
It's so sad.

285
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,110
I don't understand my father's heart.

286
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,380
Dad, I'm really happy to see you after not seeing you for a long time.

287
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,180
When I was a kid

288
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,580
I was bitten by a stray dog in the community and returned home covered in blood

289
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,240
You said so

290
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,910
The more you try to pull your hand back, the harder the dog bites.

291
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,840
Instead, it should...

292
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,140
Shove your hand deep into the dog's throat

293
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,710
Make it unable to breathe

294
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,980
It will open its mouth and let go of my hand.

295
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,780
Do you still remember what your father said?

296
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,480
Since you bit me

297
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:53,940
I'm gonna stick my hand deep down your throat from now on

298
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,310
How about it

299
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,080
Let's just have a good time.

300
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,940
Like before

301
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,110
dad

302
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,810
good

303
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
We'll see you soon

304
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,210
my daughter
