Please wait here for a moment.

9
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,670
You ruined Shien

10
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,420
It's all your fault

11
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,670
Help…

12
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,720
Shien

13
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,080
It's dangerous over there.

14
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,390
Come here, Dad.

What can I do for you?

20
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,860
I want to know the progress of the search

21
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:46,724
Has anyone reported seeing the child?

22
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:47,857
not yet

23
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:50,624
But there are checkpoints at major ports and roads.

24
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:52,557
He can't escape easily.

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,360
We also ensure your mother's safety...

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,990
So we still don't know where the child is.

27
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,960
It seems like you really care about Shien.

28
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,860
If you don't come with me now

29
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,390
Shien will die

30
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,720
And your mom too

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,290
Any clue of the child

32
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,290
I will let you know as soon as possible

33
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,360
Even if you are anxious, please trust us...

34
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,820
Let me help you.

37
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,820
You've helped a lot.

All seniors

39
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,920
The director has called an emergency meeting.

40
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,220
I think you need to know the situation.

41
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,720
An emergency meeting?

42
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,260
dad

43
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,960
I'm sorry for yesterday

44
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,320
You told me not to go out.

45
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,490
When did our police start

46
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,560
The prisoner was led by the nose after he said a word.

47
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,760
We judge the credibility of the confession to be high

48
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,990
She also passed a polygraph test.

49
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,690
People like Rui Shixian can easily fool a lie detector

50
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,490
We have also confirmed the first two cases

51
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,260
The alibi of Chief Rico is proved

52
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,120
Damn, you don't understand what people are saying?

53
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,560
Continuing to look for Yin Diaojun is another matter

54
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,190
But first we need to send Rui Shixian to the prosecutor's office

55
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,390
If you do this

56
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,220
It's like prosecuting someone who is not a criminal.

57
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,290
What are you doing?

58
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,860
Why did someone who should be hospitalized suddenly come to the police station?

59
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,820
Director, please trust us.

60
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,690
Although Yin Diaojun escaped, our serious crime team

61
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,160
So far, I have never checked the wrong direction.

62
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,820
As long as you continue to trust us

63
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,560
We will definitely catch the real culprit.

64
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,560
All right

65
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,560
Assuming that Yin Diaojun is the real murderer as you said

66
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,190
What evidence is there to prove that Rui Shixian is not an accomplice?

67
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,520
No

68
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,160
That's why we have to sue Rui Shixian first.

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,790
When we catch Yin Diaojun later...

70
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,820
There is no such thing as after

71
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,560
If I take it lightly again this time

72
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,720
It will be like many unsolved cases.

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,520
It was covered up, wasn't it?

74
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,620
Team Leader Zheng is right.

75
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,060
Even if it's too late

76
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,690
We should get everything back on track.

77
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,760
Damn

78
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,760
As a section chief, how can you follow your subordinates in making trouble?

79
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,920
Director

80
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,620
I also think that we must investigate Yin Tiaojun at the same time

81
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,290
So

82
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,760
Are you sure you can catch Yin Tiaojun?

83
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,890
Yes, I am sure

84
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,560
OK

85
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,760
Come on, then.

86
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,620
But you know I can't wait too long.

87
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,990
Are you going to be discharged the day after tomorrow?

88
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,890
I'll take care of it myself as soon as you're discharged.

89
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,520
Remember this for me

90
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,760
Hello

91
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,320
Are you really okay?

92
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,960
I'm fine.

93
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,320
Lying in the hospital is even more tormenting

94
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,860
And the section chief and seniors all support me so much

95
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,190
I must catch Yin Diaojun

96
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,360
Sorry, I should have done this earlier.

97
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,690
Are you apologizing, Chief?

98
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,360
Anyway, after catching that guy

99
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,020
I won't let him go easily.

100
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,790

104

We are near the West Coast Highway

122

When investigating the owner of the smuggling boat

123
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,020
Discovered a hidden case suspected to be committed by Yin Diaojun

124
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,190
Hiding the case?

125
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,360
The skeleton found in the mountains near Yongpu

126
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,020
Identification confirmed

127
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,860
The name is Park Sung Hee

128
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,490
(Identity Check Certificate Park Sung Hee)
I heard that he disappeared eight years ago.

129
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,820
The victim had a 2-year-old daughter.

130
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,060
We also obtained testimony that the victim

131
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,120
Lived with a man who looked similar to Yin Diaojun

132
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,990
If the child is still alive

133
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,190
Now 10 years old

134
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,020
Although this is just our speculation

135
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,820
But that child

136
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,520
It is very likely that this is the girl who has been following Yin Diaojun.

137
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
About this section

138
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,760
Because the victim's DNA has been obtained

139
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,420
As long as we catch her later, we can confirm her identity.

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,390
This Hyun Seok

189
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,960
Because I'm going to take over my position

190
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,090
So call and say hello

191
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,790
What do you mean?

192
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,820
Didn't we say it's my turn next?

193
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,390
If you really want to say it in order

194
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,460
Hyun Seok is your senior, so of course he has priority.

195
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,790
Director

196
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,090
How could you do this to me?

197
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,790
How hard I have worked over the years...

198
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,020
Of course I know

199
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:32,090
But they said they would help me handle the Nam Seung Hyup case

200
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,790
Can I not accept it?

201
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,160
After all, Hyun-seok has a wide network of contacts.

202
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,690
So it would be great if you could build more connections.

203
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,960
This will come in handy at times like this

204
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,860
Are you leaving?

205
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,990
Don't you have something to tell me?

206
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,360
Don't feel too sad

207
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,690
I'll promote you next time.

208
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,760
This was found near the pharmacy earlier.

209
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,820
It has been sent to the National Science Search for inspection.

210
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,290
Do you recognize this dress?

211
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,360
Where's the body?

212
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,060
Only clothes were found at the scene.

213
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,390
It feels like it was deliberately meant to be shown, so only the clothes were left.

214
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,960
The child will be fine.

215
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,360
No

216
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,490
She must have been killed.

217
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,660
He said if I didn't go with him

218
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,560
Kill Shi En

219
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,590
What

220
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,720
What do you mean?

221
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,120
Yin Tiaojun

222
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,690
Been to the hospital

223
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,520
He wants to take me away

224
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,860
Did you say Yin Tiaojun came to the hospital?

225
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,760
when

226
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,060
Please let me leave here, team leader.

227
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,160
What

228
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,990
I have to go

229
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,660
If I don't go, I'll never find the evidence.

230
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,490
Shien's body is nowhere to be found.

231
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,920
Absolutely not

232
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,090
I can't put you in danger.

233
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,760
Plus Shien's body hasn't been found yet.

234
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,220
The police are already searching

235
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,360
You just need to wait...

236
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,320
How long do we have to wait?

237
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,660
Wait until the child's body is found?

238
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,320
What happens next?

239
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,390
What to do next

240
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,420
sorry

241
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,760
Even so

242
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,020
I can't let you out.

243
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,820
But I will definitely...

244
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,360
Find Shien

245
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,120
So please believe me for the last time

246
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,960
From now on, two people will work together for 24 hours

247
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,320
Don't be distracted for a second

248
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,220
Guarding the ward

249
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
You must not let...

250
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,420
Section Chief Rui Shixian leaves the ward

251
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,890
All seniors, please gather with me now.

252
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,390
It's cold. Come here.

253
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,990
Does it hurt?

254
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,960
It's fine

255
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,890
Do you remember

256
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,620
us

257
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,520
When I first arrived at Helong

258
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,890
You put...

259
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,860
Dead Vole

260
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,090
Take it into the room

261
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,590
I yelled

262
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,320
I keep scolding you, don't I?

263
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,720
At that time

264
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,390
I complained to my dad

265
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,620
Say you are scary

266
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,560
I don't want to be with you

267
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,020
sorry

268
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,590
Because I

269
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,190
You have to live outside

270
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,960
I've always felt sorry

271
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,990
You will forgive me

272
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,690
It doesn't matter

273
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,090
Sister...

274
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,520
So

275
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,790
Dad said you should go with me when you leave.

276
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,260
Shien

277
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,590
Died because of you

278
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,390
Pretty, huh?

279
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,060
This was just delivered.

280
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,220
I convinced the police to let me bring it in to cheer you up.

281
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,260
Thank you

282
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,830
(I wish you happiness and health Wuzhen mud beach)

283
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,560
Good, thank you for your hard work.

284
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,820
Fingerprints found on uniforms

285
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,020
Same as the first two cases.

286
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,160
As Chief Rui said, it is indeed the child's uniform.

287
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,790
But the blood on the uniform is not that child's.

288
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,560
is the white blood cell count for adults

289
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,790
So he deliberately got someone else's blood on him?

290
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,720
In this case...

291
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,960
It means Shien is still alive.

292
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,390
The section where the uniforms were found is a one-way street

293
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,190
Only one entrance

294
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,560
The surveillance camera at the entrance did not capture the container truck.

295
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,290
Then he might take public transportation or walk

296
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,820
This means there is a high chance that he is still nearby.

297
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,320
Let's go to the scene first.

298
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,260
Okay, hurry up.

299
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,390
Be patient

300
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,820
I'll pick you up soon.

301
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,290
Have you seen this child?

302
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,260
No

303
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,960
Hello, have you seen this child?

304
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,090
Hello, Grandpa and Grandma

305
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,020
Have you seen a female student who looks like this?

306
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,490
It's a little girl

307
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,520
Didn't see it

308
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,590
Thanks

309
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,790
No one has seen it.

310
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,520
Let's expand the search area.

311
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,160
Team Leader

312
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,620
Leave it to us next time.

313
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,660
You go back and have a rest

314
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,920
I'm fine, keep going.

315
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,920
What's wrong? Look at your face.

316
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,290
It's just terrible.

317
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,890
No

318
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,160
Before finding Shien

319
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,020
I definitely won't go back

320
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,420
Let's go

321
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,790
Um what?

322
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,620
What

323
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,520
What does this mean? Why are you changing your tune now?

324
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
What's going on?

325
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,720
What happened

326
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,620
Someone threw something in from outside.

327
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,620
Go over there to check the situation.

328
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,990
good

329
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,690
What Happened...

330
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,520
Fourth floor needs support...

331
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,190
Section Chief, have you seen any strange people?

332
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,820
What's going on?

333
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,130
(Dressing room)

334
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,160
Family members need to sign a consent form first

335
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,320
What time is convenient?

336
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,500
(High Alert Drugs)

337
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,490
What's going on?

338
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
(Ryongchuan University Hospital)

339
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,200
(Escape ladder)

340
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,900
(Lucky Supermarket)

341
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,020
It seems to be her

342
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,860
Really

343
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,420
It should be yesterday or the day before yesterday.

344
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,160
She came to buy bread

345
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,860
Later, I don't know what happened, but he just ran away

346
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,920
She seems to live in the empty house over there by herself

347
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,090
Where is that house?

348
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,160
Isn't this reporter Kim?

349
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,220
This is Yin Diaojun's good deed.

350
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,160
It should be

351
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,790
but…

352
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,320
The killing method is completely different from the previous one.

353
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,490
This means that Yin Tiaojun is under a lot of psychological pressure now.

354
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,120
If we continue to let this guy go

355
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,620
I really don't know what he'll do.

356
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,890
No, there is only one seat on the boat tonight.

357
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:22,720
Even if you mess around like this, there won't be more.

358
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,260
Are you messing around?

359
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,760
Since we have made an appointment, we should keep it.

360
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,860
I have a plan.

361
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,160
What are you planning when you are in this state?

362
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,620
I don't care about that.

363
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,520
Or accept this position?

364
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,390
Well, forget it.

365
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,920
I guess you can't be picky in your current situation.

366
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,090
If there are not enough seats

367
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,220
One less head is enough.

368
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,560
Isn't it?

369
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,620
While we were identifying the suspect, she...

370
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,190
terribly sorry

371
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,820
At the hospital entrance

372
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,560
Didn't Rui Shixian see anyone when he left?

373
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,120
Because she left the underground parking lot...

374
