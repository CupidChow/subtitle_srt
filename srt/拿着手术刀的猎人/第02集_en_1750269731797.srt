1
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,978
Did you find anything?

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,813
If that were the case, would I be sitting here now?

3
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,815
We'll have to wait and see the results

4
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,692
Why does this feel so strong?

5
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,527
Oh no, this is a big problem.

6
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,989
I know that student well because he is a regular at my house.

7
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,991
Even before the incident, the victim

8
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,409
I left my clothes here.

9
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:19,162
So, I went to deliver clothes and the house was empty so I took them

10
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,622
I've been disappointed many times

11
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,958
What's up lately

12
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,543
Have you seen any suspicious people around you?

13
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,420
Suspicious person?

14
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,214
Oh, but isn't this the old town's love room?

15
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,424
Oh, I should show you the picture.

16
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,134
Oh, there's a picture? Yes.

17
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,309
Well, if you look at it this way

18
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,936
I'm not sure about wearing a hat

19
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,398
Oh! By the way

20
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,858
I heard your sister-in-law was discharged from the hospital?

21
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,902
Wow, brother, I already heard the news here.

22
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:54,281
Oh, well, the surgery went well and I came home the day before yesterday.

23
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,742
That's so great, huh?

24
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,161
Kidney transplant surgery is not easy.

25
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,288
Yeah, you've had a hard time.

26
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,790
Oh my, oh my, what, what's the trouble I'm having?

27
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,294
Hey, you're calling

28
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,545
It's my brother's

29
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,596
Yes, team leader

30
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,264
Oh, now?

31
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,516
I'm exploring

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,434
Oh, yes

33
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,728
Okay, yes, then please call me when you arrive.

34
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,605
yes

35
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,939
He, the new team leader?

36
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,484
Shouldn't everyone go in and see it?

37
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,528
No, I went to Seoul in the morning to do an autopsy.

38
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,613
What did you say?

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,991
No, the coroner wants to see the scene himself.

40
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,951
He said to wait and come down together.

41
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,078
yes?

42
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,580
Anna, this is really fucking annoying, man.

43
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,333
Oh, are you some kind of detective? What the heck, who's coming?

44
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,419
Yes, I am Seo Se-Hyeon, a dog from the National Institute of Scientific Investigation.

45
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,839
He was notorious for having fun playing detective chief.

46
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,634
Anna, you really hit the nail on the head, man.

47
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,260
Because I said I hate you, I hate you

48
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,138
The autopsy doctor also came and picked out something similar, huh?

49
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:03,600
The wait is freezing, I'm just too busy exploring! Shit, tsk

50
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,811
Brother, turn off the phone.

51
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,979
Habits must be established at the beginning.

52
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,106
Is that so?

53
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,608
These people are going to get scolded by the team leader

54
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,863
turn off

55
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,333
Nam Seung-hyeop this

56
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,086
Is it that hard to deal with a simple assault rather than drugs?

57
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,588
Oh, if it becomes like this

58
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,882
Oh, what's the point of my reputation in front of the inspiration?

59
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,051
Don't worry

60
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,719
Mr. Oh, unconditionally until today

61
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,264
Because I said I would meet with Manager Seo and negotiate

62
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,849
Just wait a little bit

63
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,767
What makes you so relaxed?

64
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,603
Oh, you're misunderstanding me again.

65
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,690
When will I come again?

66
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,361
So, I'm personally taking care of everything like this.

67
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,864
When our senior received the gold badge

68
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,907
I want to make it flawless

69
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,161
Hey, right, tsk

70
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,458
Oh, but

71
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,877
Why don't you tell me not to grip too hard?

72
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,089
If you turn around and report the already twisted kid,

73
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,091
Oh, Mr. C

74
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,261
Chief Seo is a person who can do nothing but autopsy.

75
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,597
Besides, my transfer to the main office is just around the corner.

76
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,933
I guess he has that much insight, right?

77
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,812
Oh, Mr. Oh, call him once.

78
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,899
Mr. Oh, I went down to Yongcheon with Manager Seo this morning.

79
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,358
Hey, again?

80
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,361
Hey, don't do that, I told you. Seriously.

81
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,796
Is the scene tidy?

82
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,048
No, it was left as it was when it was discovered.

83
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,384
But judging by the cleanliness of the scene, this probably isn't the first murder.

84
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,969
Why?

85
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,431
If it was the first murder, there would have been a great emotional disturbance.

86
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,558
Of course, the site is bound to become messy.

87
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,352
excuse me

88
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,438
These are the boots the culprit left behind.

89
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,316
The culprit changed into that and dumped the body.

90
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,653
No matter how well planned the abandonment was,

91
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,198
It's hard to be adept at using items found at the first murder scene.

92
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,075
You're pretty sharp.

93
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,828
Oh, actually I'm into criminal psychology

94
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,412
But isn't that a bit hasty?

95
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,333
If the criminal hadn't expected the mud,

96
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,502
Of course I needed different shoes.

97
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,923
ah

98
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,344
If you think about it with an answer in mind, you may be moving away from the truth.

99
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,189
The criminal's hands are all over the dissected body

100
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,985
A corpse left behind as if it were nothing in a clean scene

101
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,533
The criminal is skilled in everything from body disposal to abandonment.

102
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,829
This murder will not be the first.

103
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,714
If you wanted to hide it, you could have hidden it perfectly.

104
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,511
Why would they put the corpse on display here?

105
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,020
if

106
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,607
If you want someone to find it

107
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,488
To someone

108
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,325
If it's a message you send

109
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,701
Why is that

110
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,331
We're doing a soil test to make sure this is the actual murder site.

111
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,707
I want to check

112
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,667
Is the evidence list complete?

113
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,127
Still in progress

114
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,299
When the results come out, please send a list of evidence to this email address.

115
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,651
How do you plan to proceed with the investigation going forward?

116
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,777
Oh, that's

117
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,447
I know, detectives, you hate asking questions like this.

118
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,823
But this is my way

119
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,241
I will do it according to the principle.

120
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:34,245
First, we will investigate the area around the scene of the incident and the area around the victim.

121
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,539
In fact, there have been many reports of stalking recently.

122
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,583
The victim was one of them, so

123
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,419
I was thinking of digging that up first

124
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,672
I saw a dense scene with no evidence

125
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,216
I feel like it's closer to a planned crime than an accident.

126
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,802
I plan to go through the initial investigation step by step.

127
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,138
Should we rule out the suspect and go back to the beginning?

128
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,476
It's not that I won't investigate.

129
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,770
I'm going to look for a target

130
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,231
It has been revealed here and there in advance

131
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,775
I think it doesn't quite match the situation on the ground

132
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,194
I want to see the evidence collected.

133
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,738
Didn't you say that earlier?

134
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,950
If you decide on an answer, you may end up getting further from the truth.

135
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,328
What about CCTV?

136
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,414
Oh, yes

137
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,707
That's it anyway

138
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,709
As you can see

139
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,085
There is no such thing on this road now

140
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,672
What is that?

141
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,843
Oh, that's lighting up the road, so it's on the scene

142
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,761
There is no sign of bending over the body.

143
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,139
Then of course you used a big vehicle.

144
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,100
There are no tire marks of a specific vehicle around the scene.

145
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,060
I came by another route

146
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,522
Then it must have been captured on the CCTV at that intersection.

147
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,691
ah

148
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,775
yes

149
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,485
Yeah, that's right

150
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,489
When I checked the CCTV

151
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,075
There were a lot of taxis coming and going.

152
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,243
Well, since I'm already looking for it

153
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,662
I guess I'll have to check all the delivery vehicles.

154
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,210
Are you going straight away?

155
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,298
I will contact you as soon as the autopsy report comes out.

156
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,716
yes

157
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,802
Be careful when climbing up!

158
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,014
Let's have dinner together and go

159
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,479
Yes, sir

160
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,396
oh my

161
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,067
Oh, by the way, I didn't even realize my battery was dead while I was exploring.

162
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,069
Are you still at the scene?

163
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,779
Yeah, what

164
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,697
But where are you now?

165
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,566
Given the on-site situation, it may not be easy to obtain additional DNA.

166
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,861
First, let's at least identify the location of the crime.

167
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,532
I'm leaving the soil analysis that was just collected urgently

168
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,826
Are you listening?

169
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,000
Please pay, manager.

170
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:26,918
what?

171
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,461
It's Nam Seung-hyeop's case

172
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,464
I think I already answered that

173
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,799
If that's true then

174
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,677
I will send it directly to the director.

175
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,098
This is my case, which the director personally entrusted to me.

176
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,519
Why did the director assign that job to Mr. Oh?

177
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,021
Because the manager does not follow the rules

178
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,648
It must have come to me

179
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,525
It's not a cause, it's an opportunity.

180
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,026
Then it won't work?

181
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,487
Oh, to be honest

182
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,738
I will do it instead of the manager

183
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,575
Do you know how many slaps you've gotten from detectives?

184
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,410
I endured that time and now

185
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,495
I'm trying to become independent, so please help me.

186
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,707
What if it becomes a problem of trust in our organization?

187
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,917
The authenticity and trustworthiness of the autopsy

188
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,919
Well, these are all excuses

189
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,213
You're doing that because of the promotion.

190
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,048
really

191
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,801
Do I really have to go this far?

192
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,845
I've already made up my mind

193
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,389
Think about it until tomorrow

194
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,474
Please let me know

195
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,351
I don't do it

196
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,561
jeon

197
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,105
I will do it

198
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,124
A little bastard

199
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,443
There is no sign of bending over the body.

200
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,779
Then of course you used a big vehicle.

201
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:45,974
Yes, strong team Jeong Jeong-Hyeon

202
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,684
Team leader, I am reporter Kim Hyeong-su.

203
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,810
Yes, are you okay?

204
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:49,811
Yes, there isn't.

205
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,249
Oh, you're here?

206
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,334
Thank you for your hard work.

207
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,919
Is everything okay, Mom?

208
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,172
Yes, you were in good condition today.

209
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,883
Thank you always. Eat this when you go out.

210
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,844
Oh my, why are you always like this?

211
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,345
I will eat it with gratitude

212
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,513
yes

213
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,689
I won't stay still this time either

214
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,524
I'll sort it out by Monday

215
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,694
Manager Yang, please speak to the director carefully.

216
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,447
Yes, I will contact you again.

217
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,450
yes

218
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,994
Yes, come in, sir, yes.

219
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,667
what!

220
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,876
But who is your sister?

221
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,346
Mom, you're my daughter.

222
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,598
Seo Se-Hyeon

223
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,309
Don't you remember?

224
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,938
My mom is on my scalpel

225
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,524
I even engraved your initials on it

226
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,159
Sister, you are so pretty

227
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,327
Sister, you are a good person.

228
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,173
Mom is pretty too

229
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,677
Oh my, what a strange person

230
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,805
Why am I your sister's mom?

231
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,603
ouch

232
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,691
Oh, it hurts

233
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,674
Yes, this is Seo Se-Hyeon.

234
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,219
I was going to call you anyway because I saw you missed my call.

235
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,306
On the morning of the 7th in Yongcheon-si, Gyeonggi-do

236
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,725
The body of a woman in her 20s was found

237
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,519
The body was found

238
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,106
All organs except the stomach were gone.

239
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,607
In the cross section of the corpse

240
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,944
Traces of attempts to suture with ordinary household thread were detected.

241
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,862
It's shocking

242
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,781
The incident was reported on SNS

243
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,325
Also known as the 'Tailor Murder Case'

244
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,160
It's spreading rapidly

245
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,999
Along with the fact that the victim had reported stalking before his death

246
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,750
The Yongcheon Police Station in charge

247
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,671
As it became known that they had failed to arrest the stalking suspect,

248
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,339
Citizens' anxiety is growing

249
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,425
The police's initial response was inadequate.

250
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,885
Criticism is growing louder

251
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,847
As of now, there has been no progress in the investigation.

252
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,349
What a little kid!

253
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,519
Which kid leaked it to the press?

254
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,604
uh?

255
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,105
Jeong Jeong-hyeon, is that you?

256
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,064
It's not me

257
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,401
Anyway, let's find out what kind of guy he is!

258
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,612
I'll rip your mouth open, Mr. Lee.

259
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,156
What about Changjin?

260
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,949
Senior Changjin is still

261
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,284
Yes, that's it

262
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,953
Something urgent came up and I took my annual leave today.

263
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,079
Who cares?

264
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,459
Are you okay with it?

265
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,501
yes?

266
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,383
Sorry, oh my, I'm the team leader

267
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,969
Yeah, cool, cool

268
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,388
Fantastic guys, very

269
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,645
Oh, shit, seriously

270
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:09,732
Oh, the police station is in trouble. There really isn't a single quiet day.

271
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,150
Hey, team leader

272
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:12,860
But isn't that true?

273
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,195
What do you mean?

274
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,988
No, I heard you spoke to reporter Kim.

275
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,032
You said you've already checked everything?

276
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,700
I never talked about the incident

277
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,787
Yeah, yeah, well, I guess so.

278
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,498
But, the internal gunfire is a bit

279
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,209
Aren't you annoyed?

280
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,962
Is there any room inside to shoot?

281
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,798
You guys are ignoring me and doing whatever you want

282
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,007
As you wish?

283
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,426
Team leader, what is the attitude you are talking about now?

284
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,552
What's your attitude?

285
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,137
What, did I say something wrong?

286
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,972
And senior Changjin doesn't do that either

287
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,766
It's an emergency right now, so if something comes up

288
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,518
Report to me first?

289
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,729
Wow, shit, you're really going to do this

290
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,357
Okay, since we're on the subject, let's take off the rank badges and take a look.

291
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,235
Do you think it's possible that you're older than our Changjin hyung right now?

292
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,195
Dude, dude, fuck, you're out, stay still

293
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,031
He graduated from Kyunghee University and got the team leader position for free.

294
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,283
He is arrogant and doesn't even listen to what others say!

295
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,119
Oh, let's stop, okay? You're the only cop?

296
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,286
Are you the only one who thinks so great?

297
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,330
Oh, shit, let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see

298
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,208
Oh, what the hell is that guy swearing at? Kid

299
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,051
Okay, let go, let go, come on!

300
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,469
Oh, right

301
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,971
Ha, really

302
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,765
Oh, really, you're being rude to me when you're a rookie?

303
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,559
Just wait and see

304
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,519
I'm gonna make you cry soon, sir

305
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,312
My brother was wrong

306
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,357
Oh, you're right in labeling me a traitor without any evidence.

307
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,650
This kid is real

308
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,861
Hey, whose side are you on?

309
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,030
Brother, where is the convenience in this matter?

310
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,699
This kid, oh my, shit! Ah!

311
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,409
wait for a sec

312
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,869
Oh, brother, call me, brother Changjin

313
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:45,828
Yes, brother

314
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,621
Hey, hey, hey give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

315
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,082
Yes, brother, that, how, that

316
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,959
Sister-in-law, did your second surgery go well?

317
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,677
This is Jeong Jeong-hyeon. Are you very busy?

318
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,846
The team leader must be busier, right?

319
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,765
Oh, you saw the article.

320
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:06,891
I saw it

321
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,560
The chief asked if we had leaked it to the press.

322
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,561
It's a total mess

323
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,105
The atmosphere here is no joke because of that.

324
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,774
I'm also really broken

325
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:18,194
I think the investigation will progress if it is exposed to the media.

326
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,029
Hey, that's not true

327
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,239
Honestly, even if the media made a fuss,

328
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,284
Is this just provoking the criminal to do it one more time?

329
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,453
then

330
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,623
Just catch it when it appears

331
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,836
Is that easier said than done?

332
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,172
But why did you call?

333
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,381
Oh, yes

334
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,967
I was wondering if there was anything else that came out

335
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,886
Specimens and boots

336
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,430
There is nothing specifically checked on vinyl

337
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,349
The above contents result

338
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:07,409
Twice horizontally, twice vertically

339
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,412
The above contents result

340
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,248
Not yet

341
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,170
yes

342
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,673
Well, the same goes for drugs.

343
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,175
yes

344
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,219
I know you have a lot to check and are busy.

345
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,929
Could I ask you a favor?

346
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,472
Since there is no corner to follow

347
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,100
Waiting for the results feels like a million years

348
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,018
I'm really worried that we won't be able to catch the culprit if this continues.

349
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,728
I'll hang up first

350
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,614
Oh, that's a surprise, oops, tsk

351
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,951
What happened to the thing I asked you to investigate back then?

352
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,037
Are you talking about that mold?

353
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,707
Is that really from a corpse?

354
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,588
Anything else?

355
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,631
Honey, do you have any guesses?

356
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,802
It's not a guess, it's a reasonable suspicion.

357
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,304
therefore

358
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,390
We must share that reasonable doubt

359
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,476
I'll focus on that next time too

360
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,526
When I was in college

361
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,613
During the summer vacation of the first year of the department, we do an anatomy lab.

362
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,407
At that time, the cadaver assigned to our group

363
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,242
Is it because the medication wasn't fixed properly?

364
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,202
It was moldy

365
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,787
Once the dissection begins, it will take several weeks

366
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,040
I'm living by holding onto that one cadaver

367
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,584
The mold spreads differently every day.

368
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,171
So before I leave the dissection room every day

369
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,631
Pour disinfectant

370
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,425
I scrubbed the washing solo until it made a thumping sound.

371
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,261
then

372
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,681
A person with medical knowledge

373
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,600
Could he be a suspect?

374
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,894
Maybe it's the other way around

375
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,855
That's an ignorant way to do it.

376
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,733
I wash dishes with a washing brush and clean with a washing brush.

377
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,902
The body is just right for that person

378
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,987
That's what it means, I guess

379
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,699
Honey, this is really creepy

380
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,077
No, actually

381
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,745
From that mold

382
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,665
Plastic fragments were detected

383
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,335
Because it is a material that is widely used

384
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,837
It may be difficult to determine the exact purpose, but

385
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:27,091
Judging by the shape and thickness of the plastic piece,

386
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,342
The size of the washing brush is just right

387
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,428
Next time, let me know in advance if there's an angle, so I don't keep it to myself.

388
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,599
Thank you for checking the results quickly.

389
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,020
Hey, Mr. Oh, you didn't come to work today?

390
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,107
why?

391
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,359
Did you fight?

392
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,988
You fought

393
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:51,991
What's going on?

394
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,619
What are you hoping for?

395
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,039
What? Is this a kindergarten?

396
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,125
Don't come to work because you had a fight

397
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,092
The only thing you managed to salvage was a washing brush?

398
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,053
Oh my, I have no clues

399
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,140
Hey, is there anything coming out on the stalker side?

400
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,391
yes

401
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,143
That's it, not much to say yet

402
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,313
Oh my, what is this, let alone the suspect

403
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,025
I can't find the thing to chase after, oh my

404
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,651
sorry

405
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,862
so

406
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,739
How will the investigation proceed?

407
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,324
Yes, there is no sign of bending on the body.

408
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,785
Assuming that you were traveling in a large vehicle

409
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,704
Analyzing the intersection CCTV

410
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,331
Drivers who are caught behaving strangely in a truck or passenger vehicle

411
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,667
We plan to conduct an investigation focusing on cannon cars.

412
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,504
What about the three-way CCTV idea? Not a bad idea, right?

413
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,548
Of course we should look into it.

414
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,384
There's no point in dragging this out.

415
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,553
Arresting the suspect is the top priority, right?

416
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,846
yes!

417
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,850
ah

418
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,775
Where are you guys going?

419
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:09,443
yes?

420
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,320
Aren't you going to analyze the three-way CCTV?

421
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,654
ah

422
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,532
Well, I have to do it, I have to do it

423
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,201
Let's do it tomorrow, with a clear mind.

424
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,660
See you tomorrow

425
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,164
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

426
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,918
Come quickly

427
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,461
yes

428
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,982
That can't be true

429
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,617
I'm sure he died then
