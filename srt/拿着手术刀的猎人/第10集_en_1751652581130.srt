1
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,270
This person is a mother and these two are sisters

2
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,810
Like us

3
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,150
Like us? Yeah

4
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,490
This one has white eyes, my older sister

5
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,900
This is red rose, my little brother

6
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,240
And this is a scary bear

7
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,200
I'll read it to you, so listen carefully.

8
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,040
'One cold evening when white snow was falling heavily'

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,210
'White Snow and Red Rose Living in a Cabin in the Forest'

10
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,500
'Sitting by the fire'

11
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,920
'I was playing next to my mom while she was knitting'

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,010
'Then someone knocked on the door'

13
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,800
'I'm a traveler looking for shelter. Please open the door.'

14
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,430
'At their mother's words, the girls quickly ran and opened the door.'

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,770
'But he stuck his head out to say hello'

16
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,520
'It was none other than a big, black bear.'

17
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,780
Didn't Dad tell Se-eun not to come?

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,660
It's dangerous

19
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,000
Dad, wait a minute, Dad

20
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,430
I was wrong, don't lock Se-eun up.

21
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,430
I won't go to Se-eun anymore

22
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,590
Do you know who Go Eun-seo is?

23
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,430
Please tell me

24
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,600
Doesn't the manager know?

25
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,270
Se-eun-ah

26
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,170
Sister

27
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,630
'Sister'?

28
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,270
let's go

29
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,760
The landlord said he hasn't seen you for two days.

30
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,010
What about the orchard?

31
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,430
They said they'd be coming soon

32
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,010
Oh, you're here?

33
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,060
What about the body?

34
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,810
doesn't exist

35
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,440
I think you should take a look at this

36
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,560
What is it?

37
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,070
Hey, it's pancuronium again

38
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,110
Could this also be the tailor's work?

39
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,570
Oh my, why are you acting so awkward, Kwon Hyung-jo, again?

40
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,560
Yes, sir

41
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,020
What are you doing at this hour?

42
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,440
Yes, there, the old man is here now

43
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,980
You are in a state of sudden hypotensive shock.

44
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,240
I think you need to come to the hospital quickly.

45
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,700
Mr. Chairman, I'm here.

46
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,200
Oh, you're here? Want to eat?

47
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,120
No, I'm just going to return that bowl to you.

48
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,000
Did you cry? Oh, who cried?

49
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,750
Your eyes are bloodshot, what is that?

50
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,010
why?

51
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,800
uh?

52
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,050
What's going on?

53
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,220
My son

54
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,310
Something came up suddenly so I couldn't come

55
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,440
Whew

56
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,860
You've been waiting for a long time

57
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,860
What should I do? Work comes first.

58
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,820
Having a capable son is also a problem

59
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,610
You must have been very upset

60
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,820
What the heck, I'll see you next time

61
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,240
Mr. Chairman

62
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,660
I will definitely come

63
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,250
I'm sure they've set a new date, maybe by now?

64
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,710
Is that so? Oh, of course.

65
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,630
Even if it seems like only parents think about their children

66
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,670
Children are the same. Children also want to see their parents.

67
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,340
The days when I used to be hand-tied to my parents when I was young

68
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,010
I really miss you

69
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,230
Hello Ayu, welcome

70
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,270
How many minutes? There are three of us.

71
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,070
Please take a seat where you feel comfortable. Yes.

72
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,570
Oh my, you little brat

73
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,170
My child is my enemy, my enemy

74
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,460
This house or that house

75
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,760
Then what do you do? You're a child.

76
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,430
When you scold someone, scold them harshly

77
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,770
I have to hold you

78
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,940
Ugh

79
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,860
Are you feeling okay?

80
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,450
It has become much more stable, though

81
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,580
I've been feeling a lot less physically tired lately.

82
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,500
It's not yet time to feel at ease

83
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,090
Do you like it?

84
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,680
huh

85
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,510
With this

86
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,310
We need to save many wounded people.

87
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,790
Don't forget

88
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,000
you

89
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,540
He's a good person

90
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
huh

91
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,100
So of all things

92
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,150
Kwon Hyung-jo, whom we accused of being the culprit, has disappeared.

93
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,150
And of all things

94
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,030
Seo Se-hyeon manipulated the emotional results on site

95
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,030
Pancuronium came out, is that it?

96
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,700
Then what about that video?

97
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,160
This alley

98
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,080
They say it's near Kwon Hyung-jo's house.

99
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,370
Yes, and it's roughly in line with the estimated time of the crime.

100
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,290
Seo Se-Hyeon, are you saying that you're the tailor we were chasing?

101
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,830
It's not yet the emotional results yet, though.

102
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,880
Based on circumstantial evidence, it seems

103
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,010
What the hell is going on? That could be the 4th incident.

104
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,510
There has to be something proper

105
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,350
Hey, you talk

106
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,430
Team leader

107
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,230
Are you sleeping?

108
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,190
Get out, Mr.

109
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,900
What do you think about the connection between that video and the incident?

110
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,480
Yes, not yet

111
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,700
The identity of the person who sent the video is also not clear.

112
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,370
The only thing that was captured was the supervisor standing nearby at the time of the incident.

113
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,240
What's in that carrier?

114
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,910
Was there really a manager at the scene?

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,040
I think I need to check it out some more

116
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,130
And is Mr. Kwon Hyung-jo missing or in hiding?

117
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,840
It's still not clear whether he's the victim or the perpetrator.

118
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,130
Oh, but pancuronium came out anyway

119
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,180
This isn't an easy drug to obtain.

120
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,560
It seems clear that it has something to do with us.

121
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,060
So what's the plan for the investigation?

122
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,140
With Mr. Kwon Hyung-jo

123
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,530
I think the first thing to do is to figure out Manager Seo's movements on the day of the incident.

124
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,030
When the results of the evidence collected at the scene come out,

125
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,990
Depending on whether the suspect is identified or not

126
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,030
We are planning to draw up an investigation plan.

127
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,240
When will the on-scene evidence results come out?

128
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,200
I asked the National Institute of Scientific Investigation to send it to me as soon as possible.

129
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,500
By tomorrow at the latest

130
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,710
It's a national treasure

131
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,840
Yes, Mr. Chun, did you get the results?

132
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,340
yes

133
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,140
First of all, the blood test has been completed.

134
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,510
All the bloodstains on the floor and the scalpel

135
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,850
It turned out to be Kwon Hyung-jo's

136
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,560
But, Team Leader, the scalpel you sent me

137
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,150
Are you sure you collected this on site?

138
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,360
Yes, that's right.

139
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,440
Why are you doing that?

140
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,940
I don't know how to say this

141
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,700
This is what I mean

142
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,660
The initials engraved here are

143
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,240
It's exactly the same as Manager Seo's exclusive scalpel.

144
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,590
I'm in a meeting right now, so I'll get back to you later.

145
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,840
Hey, what is this?

146
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,590
So, does that mean Manager Seo is the culprit?

147
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,310
The doctor said my blood pressure was high

148
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,810
You can rest assured.

149
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,390
That's fortunate

150
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,690
yes

151
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,610
Oh, you're going to use the caregiver again?

152
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,770
Should I call you?

153
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,190
No, I'll stay a little longer.

154
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,970
Se-eun, don't do that

155
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,600
Sorry

156
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,360
Because I got caught by my dad

157
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,230
You for no reason

158
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,320
'Don't be afraid'

159
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,700
'It's because it's too cold'

160
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,950
'Let me warm up for a moment'

161
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,960
'Then the mother said to the girls,'

162
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,670
'It's okay, guys.'

163
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,260
'I just came to your house to escape the cold.'

164
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,590
'Please take the snow off my fur'

165
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,590
'The girls only felt relieved then'

166
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,390
'Take a broom and sweep the snow off the bear's fur.'

167
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,640
'I brushed it off carefully'

168
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,230
'The bear lay by the fire and grumbled comfortably.'

169
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,060
'After such a long winter, spring has come'

170
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,360
'The bear told the girls that they had to leave now.'

171
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,200
'The bear spoke to the girls'

172
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,570
'For a long time' 'A long time'

173
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,790
'The person who was good to me' 'The person who was good to me'

174
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,790
'You were the only one' 'You were the only one'

175
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,330
'thank you'

176
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,380
Where? This is Ichan Nursing Hospital.

177
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,050
Are you sure it's still there?

178
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,690
Oh, just a moment

179
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,190
sorry

180
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,220
This fourth victim was identified as a suspect during the first incident.

181
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,600
As it has been confirmed that this is Mr. Kwon Mo,

182
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,940
The crime weapon found at the scene

183
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,360
The police succeeded in identifying the suspect.

184
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,150
Current whereabouts of suspect

185
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,870
Excuse me, where is patient Seo Won-hee's hospital room?

186
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,670
Yes, it's the police. I called you earlier.

187
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,670
Oh, just a moment

188
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,170
Senior, I'll go over there and take a look.

189
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,750
Could you please check the sickroom area? Oh, yes.

190
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,670
307, 307, please go this way.

191
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,980
Oh, right

192
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,240
and

193
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,820
Did you find it?

194
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,450
Oh, the nurse said it was there just a moment ago

195
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,790
My senior and I will start investigating the hospital staff.

196
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,500
Yes, Senior Jang and Senior Park

197
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,750
Go straight to Yongcheon

198
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,540
Please start searching Mr. Seo Se-hyeon's one-room apartment and inspecting the surrounding area.

199
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,090
Yes, I understand.

200
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,170
Let's go

201
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,540
I'm so sorry, Se-eun.

202
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,080
Instead, on this birthday

203
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,170
My sister will throw me a birthday party without telling dad.

204
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,600
Always come alone

205
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,480
I've never seen any other family

206
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,190
It's already been 5 years since the elderly person was hospitalized.

207
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,530
Even if it's late, he comes every day and gives me a massage.

208
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,320
He talked to me and read the Bible to me.

209
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,790
Even if they are children, they are not always the same for that long.

210
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,910
It's really not an easy task.

211
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,340
Elder, please tell me whenever you come to your senses.

212
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,880
It's a gift from God

213
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,640
Whew

214
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,060
Where should we go now?

215
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,940
I confirmed that there is no such thing in the hospital or the orchard.

216
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,190
Should we go to Yongcheon first?

217
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,570
Let's go to Harong

218
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,610
Yes? Right now?

219
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,570
I wouldn't have gone straight to Yongcheon anyway

220
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,120
Let's go to the house of the suspect in the blue barrel incident.

221
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,790
There must be a reason why they hid the pancuronium.

222
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,960
It also matches exactly the volume detected in the blue barrel incident.

223
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,000
Tsk, well, that's what it is

224
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,170
Anyway, I don't know where Seo Se-Hyeon is right now

225
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,510
Oh man, I'll just go through everything, whatever.

226
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,010
Let's go

227
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,100
No, the forensic scientist in charge of the case is the culprit.

228
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,440
Does this situation make sense?

229
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,860
Even if it's temporary, isn't it too bleak?

230
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,610
Let's move quickly, sir.

231
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,360
yes

232
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,420
What is this?

233
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,880
Doesn't that just not suit you?

234
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,970
kid

235
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,230
I see

236
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,370
what?

237
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,420
madam!

238
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,330
Hey, how far do we have to go?

239
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,600
Oh, what happened?

240
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,940
what?

241
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,940
What's coming out?

242
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,910
hey

243
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,120
hey!

244
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,410
Officer Kim, follow me.

245
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,680
hey!

246
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,470
hey

247
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,600
hey

248
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,570
Oh, sorry, sorry

249
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,870
Is this feeling too strong?

250
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,040
No, the Yongcheon situation is also unsettling.

251
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,630
Are we okay with each other?

252
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,550
It doesn't seem like anyone lives there

253
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,930
No, but without going crazy

254
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,560
How could he have found the body of a person who was his teammate?

255
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,850
The contents of the can are similar to human organs.

256
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,100
Whose is it?

257
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,100
It's obvious

258
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,360
Let's go in first

259
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,180
Team leader

260
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,850
here

261
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,820
Oh, what is it?

262
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,750
Whew

263
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,180
This paint looks like it's been a while.

264
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,350
yes

265
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,820
I saw it at Manager Seo's house

266
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,540
The heel was worn so the shoe print wasn't visible.

267
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,920
Oh, is this too obvious?

268
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,960
Choi Min-guk

269
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,470
It's late

270
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,810
What about rice?

271
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,070
Around your house

272
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,150
The police were all over the place

273
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,200
I wish I had listened to my dad earlier

274
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,030
This kind of thing never happens

275
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,310
you!

276
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,770
Meg me?

277
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,900
How dare you!

278
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,940
With those dirty hands!

279
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,400
My mom

280
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,200
Touch the bedding?

281
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,810
Where is the top car?

282
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,440
uh?

283
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,340
oh!

284
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,860
Dare

285
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,520
To dad

286
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,980
If you show your teeth

287
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,610
No way

288
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,600
Take it easy, you're hurt

289
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,080
Welcome home

290
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,370
my daughter
