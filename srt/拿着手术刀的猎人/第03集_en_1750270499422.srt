1
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,200
Twice across

2
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,240
Double vertical

3
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,910
Twice across

4
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,790
Double vertical

5
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,510
I can't get scolded by my dad

6
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,140
Don't leave handprints

7
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,850
Don't leave a trace

8
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,140
Not even a single fingerprint should remain

9
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,020
I have to clean it up before dad comes.

10
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,760
Oh, detective!

11
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,600
No, what is this, what is this, huh?

12
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,890
That's a tailor, right? Yes?

13
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,230
Oh, when will we be able to chew it well?

14
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,730
You look happy, Reporter Kim?

15
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,610
A person died, but are you happy?

16
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,650
Boy, are you excited?

17
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,950
There were a series of murders within a week.

18
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,240
Oh, okay, let's see you at the presentation

19
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,740
Here, there, people, get them all out of the alley right now.

20
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,120
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,410
Citizens' right to know must also be respected.

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Do you see no risk of another victim?

23
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,630
Detective!

24
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,750
It's a little late. Who was the first discoverer?

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,300
Yes, there was no one around

26
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,510
Because I've been working alone all this time

27
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,470
Any additional information?

28
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,810
Hey

29
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,520
This time, it might be a bit difficult to verify your identity, right?

30
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,060
I cut off all the joints of this finger.

31
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,900
Did you get a statement?

32
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,900
Yes, but what else besides white cloth?

33
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,740
I don't think you saw anything in particular

34
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,360
He said there was no one walking around.

35
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,660
kid

36
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,200
You said plastic was detected yesterday?

37
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,830
Whew

38
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,870
What is that?

39
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,750
I collected some of the cleaning brushes sold on the market.

40
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,420
These are products that are widely used in ordinary households.

41
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,550
ah!

42
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,840
This one

43
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,430
What are the soil analysis results?

44
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,310
That's what Mr. Oh was doing

45
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,560
Let me check it out right now

46
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,400
Okay, tell Teacher Oh to do it himself.

47
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,440
Well, you haven't gone to work yet.

48
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,570
also?

49
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,740
Call me, quick

50
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,370
I did it but you didn't accept it

51
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,080
There is no callback

52
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,660
Manager Seo

53
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,120
The director is looking for you urgently

54
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,300
What happened?

55
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,890
Oh, that's it, just now

56
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,640
Dispatched after receiving a report of a body being found

57
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,350
Hey, did I tell you?

58
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,480
You answer

59
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,940
What do you mean, same offender?

60
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,360
Field investigation results

61
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,190
The previously discovered corpse and the method of the crime were very similar.

62
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,690
How can you be so sure?

63
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,280
This time, the thread was found

64
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,530
line?

65
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,570
yes

66
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,700
If there is this much similarity, there is a high possibility that it is the same person.

67
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,910
It might be a copycat

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,330
okay

69
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,710
We can't rule out the possibility that it's a copycat.

70
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,290
Even without that, I see it on SNS every day these days

71
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,630
Well, you're a tailor or something

72
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,010
He was even bragging while reenacting the crime.

73
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,090
It hasn't even been a week since the first body was discovered.

74
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,640
You're saying you learned this quickly in such a short period of time?

75
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,390
Hey, hey, Jeong Jeong-hyeon

76
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,470
Is this your first murder case?

77
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,100
Yes, that's right.

78
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,520
however

79
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,900
Because of that one thread, they're all the same criminals

80
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,650
Can I be so sure of this?

81
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,400
Okay, team leader

82
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,530
Well, this did come out, by any chance

83
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,330
Is this an autopsy warrant?

84
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,370
yes

85
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,040
We'll know for sure when the autopsy results come out.

86
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,250
Then I'll be back

87
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,790
Hey, hey, hey!

88
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, that kid

89
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,130
Oh, shit

90
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Hey, hey, I'll give all the detectives a pass.

91
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,060
Find the stalker first, unconditionally

92
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,220
If there's no suspect, we're all screwed, really.

93
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,640
Okay, I understand.

94
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,690
No, but

95
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,900
Shouldn't one person follow the team leader?

96
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,480
Damn, this kid

97
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,650
Hey, get your stance right.

98
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,320
yes

99
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,830
Oh, did anything come out about the Yongcheon City incident?

100
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,950
Nothing special yet

101
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,870
okay?

102
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,250
Well, if you dig up to this point with Manager Seo's skills and it doesn't come out,

103
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,250
There probably isn't one

104
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,080
Then, the Yongcheon incident

105
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,170
Let's move on and finish it once the drug results come out

106
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,880
Hey, what happened to Mr. Oh Min-ho?

107
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,880
What, you said you didn't come out today?

108
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,550
yes

109
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,550
Oh my, you're even a team leader

110
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,930
You're just fighting with your subordinates

111
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,730
What the heck!

112
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,520
If I talk, only my mouth hurts

113
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,480
So are you just going to watch this happen?

114
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,940
Go home and see

115
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,820
Try calling the emergency contact number

116
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,320
Oh, so, anyway, shouldn't we take action?

117
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,160
Don't waste any more time

118
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,370
Take care of Mr. Oh Min-ho's case today, okay?

119
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,750
yes

120
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,130
I bought a voice because the connection was not working

121
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,010
Manager Seo

122
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,300
Another body has been found

123
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,470
Again?

124
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,970
Can you do an autopsy right away?

125
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,770
Oh, now

126
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,150
This time, the thread was found

127
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,400
I am revealing myself as much as I have revealed myself

128
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,810
I'm ready

129
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,680
Manager

130
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,640
Here, I think there's something in here too.

131
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,720
specimen plate

132
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,840
yes

133
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,060
Ribbon knot

134
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,080
Find out the identity first

135
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
yes

136
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,320
Does this look like a child's handprint?

137
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,400
Manager

138
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,480
How did it go?

139
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,110
My fingerprints came out

140
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,200
But there is no owner

141
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,110
Yes? What is that?

142
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,280
There is no suspect matching the fingerprints.

143
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,120
Are you sure you checked correctly?

144
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,620
Then I

145
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,710
Are you saying you made a mistake?

146
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
no

147
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,300
I was asking if that was possible.

148
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,970
I will re-examine, but the result will be the same.

149
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,390
Yes, I understand. Then what is the identity of the deceased?

150
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,720
It's confirmed

151
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,640
Who are you?

152
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,230
Oh Min-ho

153
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,530
This is my team member

154
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,370
Hey, grab it here, grab it

155
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,540
Is it too windy?

156
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,830
Ah, just pull it up and lift it up a bit!

157
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,630
Oh, I think that's about right. Oh, oh

158
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,250
Oh, be careful

159
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,840
Oh, wait a minute, first of all, first of all, yes?

160
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,300
Oh, I'll tie it here, then

161
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,470
Detective Park! Hey, bro!

162
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,510
Up, yes, what did you say?

163
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Up here, it's crooked, this way

164
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,690
Oh, right, right, kid, a little more

165
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,600
Hey, hey, you've gone too far, just come down a little

166
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,440
Like this? Oh, oh, right, okay.

167
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,940
Okay, thanks for your hard work!

168
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,940
Go ahead, brother! Yes!

169
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,200
Oh, I have to upload it

170
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,670
Really?

171
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,090
Is this really Mr. Oh?

172
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,880
I guess they'll investigate?

173
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,180
I guess they'll do some background checks

174
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,140
Reference person

175
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,560
Everyone, please cooperate with the police as much as possible.

176
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,890
But you know, even if I get investigated

177
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,520
Keep quiet about Nam Seung-hyeop, okay?

178
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,560
Well, well, I don't know

179
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,520
That, uh, that was the first case Mr. Oh was in charge of.

180
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,740
It's obvious as day that he's going to start talking nonsense

181
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,700
Hurry up before it gets noisy

182
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,490
Let's wrap it up with Manager Seo's case and get rid of it.

183
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,780
Yes, then by today

184
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,540
Request a drug re-examination from the toxicology department

185
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,370
Hey, what kind of reexamination is this in this yard?

186
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,420
Just upload it now!

187
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,840
I can't post results that contradict the autopsy results.

188
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,630
Sir

189
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,880
From Manager Seo's perspective

190
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,510
I think I'm doing this now because I'm afraid they'll ask me to take responsibility later.

191
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,220
You're talking about responsibility

192
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,220
Don't worry about that problem.

193
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,010
I'll take full responsibility, okay?

194
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,600
I don't like it

195
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,060
It was an incident that came into my room

196
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,150
Oh, this is your first solo case.

197
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,860
Need to re-examine

198
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,650
okay?

199
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,610
Well, if that's what you think

200
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,320
good

201
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,530
Call Mr. Chun

202
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,570
yes

203
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,620
Hey, hey, Mr. Chun, you're here?

204
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,830
Did you call?

205
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,130
Oh, yeah

206
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,800
As of this time

207
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,220
Mr. Cheon is in charge of all the autopsy cases of Director Seo.

208
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,930
What are you doing now?

209
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,060
Why? You said you couldn't do what I told you to do?

210
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,270
Oh, and please send the payment directly to me.

211
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,350
Hey, boss

212
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,110
How can I, who am not even a forensic scientist,

213
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,030
No, I have a master's degree in anatomy.

214
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,780
After four years as an investigator, you should know most things, right?

215
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,200
Well, what about Mr. Chun's skills?

216
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,700
I'll pass on the complicated stuff to another team.

217
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,040
Let's try to do something simple by cooperating with external personnel.

218
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,960
I will actively support you

219
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,000
please

220
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,840
Do you really have to go this far?

221
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,000
'Good job, good job'

222
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,130
Do you think you've achieved anything because you're being praised here and there?

223
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,470
Don't get me wrong

224
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,100
There are many people in the world who can work besides you.

225
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,140
It's an emergency situation where even if everyone works together with one mind and one purpose, it won't be enough.

226
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,390
You're being so stubborn and ignorant, tsk

227
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,900
I, Manager Seo

228
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,450
We need to investigate the references

229
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,200
Where should I do it?

230
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,030
Should we do it here? Or what, the police station?

231
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,370
Over there, than that

232
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,950
Are you okay?

233
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,670
On the day of the incident

234
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,680
Mr. Oh Min-ho came down to the Yongcheon site

235
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,930
You went up together on the bus, right?

236
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,970
I saw the CCTV

237
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,810
It seemed like you were having a serious conversation about something.

238
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,270
What did you talk about?

239
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,310
I'm not sure, but I think it was about work

240
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,730
After we broke up, you went straight home?

241
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,320
no

242
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,030
I went to the hospital

243
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,160
Is this a hospital?

244
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,660
Where does it hurt?

245
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,500
Do I have to say that?

246
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,790
no

247
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,670
Oh, that's not it

248
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,550
At the estimated time of death of Mr. Oh Min-ho

249
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,920
All you have to do is prove that you were there.

250
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,890
I was there late, check it out

251
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,100
Then maybe

252
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,150
There was someone in the company who was not on good terms with Mr. Oh Min-ho.

253
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,070
Something strange happened around Mr. Oh Min-ho.

254
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,150
Do you know anything?

255
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,940
well

256
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,660
I don't know much about personal life

257
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,910
Yes, I understand.

258
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,170
So finally

259
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,210
I was wondering if you had any guesses about this.

260
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,960
Why would they dump the body in Yongcheon?

261
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,630
If you look at the estimated time of death, it is that time

262
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,840
Mr. Oh Min-ho was definitely in Seoul.

263
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,220
Dad, are you going to Yongcheon today?

264
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,470
Manager Seo?

265
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,350
I don't know

266
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,440
Don't be too upset

267
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,320
I will definitely catch the culprit.

268
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,800
Yes, sir

269
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,680
The victim is Mr. Oh of the National Forensic Service

270
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,050
Hey, are you sure?

271
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,220
I'm on my way out after the investigation of Director Seo's witness.

272
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,600
The surviving family members include my mother and older brother.

273
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,270
My mother collapsed as soon as she heard the news.

274
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,190
Come together first

275
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,350
We found the suspect

276
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,650
This is the CCTV of the parcel logistics warehouse where Lee Yeon-ju worked.

277
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,240
A delivery man who worked at the same time

278
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,820
Hey, hey, I was hovering around Ms. Lee Yeon-ju like that.

279
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,700
He said he was very stressed because of that.

280
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,330
Fruit tree analysis results

281
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,500
The stalking suspect we missed last time

282
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,460
It was confirmed that the impression was the same

283
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,080
And what's even more surprising is

284
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,090
Sentenced to 7 years for murder in 2008

285
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,710
I was released from prison 10 years ago.

286
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,840
okay?

287
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,180
Hey, what are you guys doing? I'm going to apply for an arrest warrant right away.

288
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,090
wait a minute

289
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,760
This is evidence of stalking.

290
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,310
Isn't this evidence of the murder that just occurred?

291
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,890
But it is too early to conclude that he is a suspect

292
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,020
so

293
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,190
Who do you think the culprit is?

294
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,860
that

295
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,320
I have to find it now

296
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,360
On what basis?

297
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,280
What, here, thread and a cleaning brush, something like that?

298
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,410
A kid who doesn't even know the culprit is always opposing, shit

299
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,160
Changjin, I'm applying for an arrest warrant

300
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,450
Then oh, what else!

301
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,330
I was already watching the CCTV mainly focusing on large vehicles.

302
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,290
The control vehicle number has already been secured.

303
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,920
Just check that and then issue a warrant.

304
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,920
There's not much left now

305
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,550
If you concentrate quickly, it won't take long.

306
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,260
What do you guys think?

307
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,800
uh?

308
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,810
I contacted Mr. Chun a little while ago anyway

309
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,890
You came in person?

310
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,480
Did you get anything?

311
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,020
yes

312
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,310
In the plastic wrap that wrapped Lee Yeon-ju's body

313
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,650
Soil containing sodium elements was detected

314
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,570
and

315
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,530
In the corpse

316
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,660
A large amount of pancuronium was detected.

317
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,250
It is a paralytic muscle relaxant used in poisoning.

318
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,380
In an instant, the body becomes paralyzed,

319
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,920
It's a quantity that can lead to death.

320
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,520
49…

321
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,630
492…

322
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,420
492…

323
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,970
'7492', found

324
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,560
Where, where! I found it

325
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,850
Oh, what, what is it? Oh, here, here

326
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,310
Here, here, here

327
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,270
Wait, let me see, let me see

328
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,610
4:26, 4:26

329
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,150
This is what we expected

330
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,030
When I abandoned the body and escaped through the intersection

331
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,690
That's pretty much the same as the estimated time, right?

332
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,410
This is Jeong Jeong-Hyeon from the strong team

333
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,870
Please call 72bar7492 for emergency vehicle inquiries

334
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,680
Twice horizontally, twice vertically

335
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,700
Are you there?

336
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,710
I see

337
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,330
Didn't this kid notice and run away?

338
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,590
Even if I jump out

339
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,300
Since his identity has already been identified, he probably couldn't have gone far.

340
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,670
First, let's search the house and secure evidence.

341
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,840
Come in, open it

342
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,480
Hey! Hey, you little shit!

343
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,480
I see

344
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,900
Hey, hey, Seokwoo, Seokwoo

345
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,570
Go back, go back. Yes, I understand.

346
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,870
Hey, Hyukgeun, Hyukgeun, break it, break it, break it

347
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,780
Mr. Lee

348
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,420
madam

349
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,750
Oh, hey, over there!

350
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,420
Hurry up and go! Oh, really, aren't you coming for work?

351
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,090
That kid

352
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,770
Hey, team leader! Hey

353
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,270
Hey, team leader, team leader, ah, ah

354
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,650
Bro, that kid fell off on his own!

355
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,440
Oh my gosh, really!

356
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,470
uh?

357
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,840
Team leader!

358
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,260
hey!

359
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,220
Hey, you little shit, kid, seriously

360
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,390
Hey, follow me, follow me

361
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,890
I see

362
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,610
Teacher Choi

363
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,320
Teacher Choi!

364
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,240
Yes, yes

365
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,030
Agricultural plastic covering the body

366
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,240
Please bring it to me so I can check my fingerprints.

367
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,740
But that vinyl

368
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,040
We've already investigated everything.

369
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,620
The area is so large that I'm afraid I might miss something

370
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,000
Break it all down into pieces

371
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,580
Well, that vinyl is fine.

372
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,380
Let's take a look at that tape that was stuck there.

373
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,780
Whether it's fingerprints or DNA

374
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,490
Please check everything

375
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,230
Oh my!

376
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,120
This kid, y'know

377
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,620
Get up, get up

378
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,620
Team leader, team leader, are you okay?

379
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,250
I see

380
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,000
Hey! Stay still, stay still.

381
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,960
Hold on tight, Mr. Lee

382
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,970
Hey, put it down

383
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,970
Put the fuck down

384
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,760
Come on, come on, oh my!

385
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,180
Hey, hey, stay still, stay still

386
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,600
I see

387
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,440
Stay still

388
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,650
This kid is going to die, Lee

389
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,650
You have the right to remain silent

390
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,530
All statements from now on

391
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,280
can be used against you

392
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,450
He can hire a lawyer

393
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,820
Are you aware of this fact?

394
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,040
Oh, I don't know, what the fuck, really

395
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,210
I realized

396
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,350
Oh, we said we would do it

397
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,430
this

398
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,860
I can't get scolded by my dad

399
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,030
Don't leave handprints

400
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,910
Don't leave a trace

401
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,540
Not even a single fingerprint should remain

402
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,920
I have to clean it up before dad comes.
