00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,014
(clicks)

3
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,438
(sighs)
YESOOL: How do I face Cha Minhu?

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,107
(light music rises)

5
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,111
(sighs deeply)
Why am I so nervous?

6
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,157
(light music)

7
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,257
(theme music)

EPISODE 07

00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,355
(light music)

10
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,241
YESOOL: Relax, Yesool.

11
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,617
Just act natural.

12
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,788
BASED ON THE WEBNOVEL
KISS SIXTH SENSE BY GOT W

13
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,756
(exhales deeply)

14
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,591
Ms. Hong.

15
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,259
(sighs)

16
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,552
I came straight to work

17
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,055
after working all night
at Director Lee Pilyo's studio.

18
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,391
(sighs)
The video came out totally awesome,

19
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,188
but the client sent us
a shitload of things to fix this morning.

20
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,400
-The captions, logo, and slogan.
-(Minhee sighs)

21
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,444
They sent us really crappy feedback.

22
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,529
How do I tell the director about this?

23
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,448
(disbelieving laughter)

24
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,785
Ms. Hong, please give us some tips...

25
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,328
Oh...

26
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,456
(tearfully)
Ms. Hong, help us.

27
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,792
I think we'll get our ass kicked
by Mr. Cha first

28
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,085
when we tell him about it.

29
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,545
Is Mr. Cha in yet?

30
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,006
Yes, he's been here
since early this morning.

31
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,716
It's like he doesn't even sleep.

32
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,345
Here's your coffee.

33
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,514
Oh. I'm off, then.

34
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,516
Wait...

35
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,643
(footsteps receding)

36
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,977
Let's just drink coffee.

37
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,106
Three more espresso shots, please.

38
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,858
AUTOMATED VOICE: The doors are closing.

39
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,320
(light music)

40
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,870
YESOOL: What? He's not there.

41
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,375
(light music continues)

42
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,974
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

43
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,896
What is it, Mr. Cha?

44
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,607
I didn't see a tab
for the current expenses

45
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,317
in the excel sheet for our Mopix budget.

46
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,111
Oh, uh...
(gasps)

47
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,071
It should be in the final file.

48
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,031
I'm sorry. I'll resend it.

49
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:03,160
Did you pass on the PowerPoint form
that we're going to use for the PPM

50
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,412
and the copy that we asked
Production Team 3 to give us?

51
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,915
I gave it to Mr. Kim. Haven't you seen it?

52
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,876
I'll check.

53
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,380
-Oh, Hong Yesool.
-Yes?

54
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,800
Email me the revised proposal
you checked last time.

55
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,760
Oh, okay.

56
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,019
YESOOL: What's with that guy?
Are we really dating?

57
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,316
Shall we start dating?

58
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,068
YESOOL: As you said, Mr. Cha,

59
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,863
let's date.

60
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,199
Suggesting that we date...

61
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,160
Is it because of the future you saw or

62
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,537
is it because you feel differently
about me now?

63
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,581
(sighs lightly)

64
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,250
I don't know. It's just that

65
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,670
you're always on my mind,

66
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,173
and I want to confirm my feelings as well.

67
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,095
(soft music)

68
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,478
I've heard everything I wanted to hear.

69
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,313
Okay.

70
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,482
Let's date.

71
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,529
(surprised grunt)

72
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,489
Why are you so
out of it this early in the day?

73
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,282
Let's have our meeting.

74
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,367
Yes, ma'am.

75
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,248
(light music)

76
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,174
(sighs)

77
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,741
(light music continues)

78
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,887
-MAN: Thank you.
-I'll see you tomorrow.

79
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,096
See you tomorrow.

80
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,894
(light music)

81
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,234
Wait. We're supposed to be dating.

82
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,654
He hasn't contacted me at all.

83
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,781
My goodness.

84
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,248
YESOOL: Was Mr. Cha out of the office
all day today?

85
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,838
MINHEE: No,
he's been in his office all day. Why?

86
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,633
(snorts)

87
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,094
(sighs deeply)

88
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,888
YESOOL: I had a question for him.

89
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,056
All right.

90
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,601
-(inhales deeply)
-(phone buzzes)

91
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,229
MR. CHA MINHOO

92
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,856
Ha.

93
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,150
(cell phone vibrates)

94
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,402
Yes.

95
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,030
(soft music)

96
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,414
YESOOL: Why are we at a hotel?

97
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,046
(soft music continues)

98
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,056
Where are we going?

99
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,395
(music fades)

100
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,981
Did you wait for my call today?

101
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,568
(disbelieving noise)
You mean you waited for my call.

102
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,362
Are you trying to make it obvious
that this is our first date?

103
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,989
You've watched way too many dramas.
This is so cliché.

104
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,074
(laughs)

105
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,785
Did you sleep well last night?

106
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,705
Yeah, I slept really well.
I sleep well these days.

107
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,833
Now that I'm in Production Team 2,
no one pesters me.

108
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,001
I have a lot more time to sleep, too.

109
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,211
That's good.

110
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,424
YESOOL: Yesool, why are you overreacting?

111
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,134
Oh.

112
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,429
I wanted to talk to you anyway, Mr. Cha.

113
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,013
Go ahead.

114
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,099
Let's set some terms.

115
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,353
We started out in a pretty unusual way,

116
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,480
and you're also my senior at work.

117
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,942
So I think we need to agree on
a few things if we want to start dating.

118
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,362
(light music playing)

119
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,412
POST-EVENT AGREEMENT (EDITED)
CHA MINHOO

120
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,082
Impressive.

121
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,043
You prepared all this?

122
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:07,172
Well, I've learned a lot from my mentor.

123
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,966
(exhales deeply)
Hmm.

124
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,845
This isn't what I wanted to talk about,
but let's hear it.

125
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,264
I want to keep it a secret.

126
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,059
-I thought you'd say that.
-Let's abide by that article,

127
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,019
and not ask about any secrets
that we each don't want to talk about

128
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,272
and not interfere with each other's
private lives. Don't ask, don't meddle.

129
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,734
Unless it's a special occasion,
let's only meet on the weekends.

130
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,402
So that it won't interfere with our work.

131
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,531
Okay. But I can't see you
on the third Saturday of every month.

132
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,824
Why not?

133
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,869
Okay, okay. Fine.

134
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,538
Also,

135
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,292
as far as getting physical,
when it comes to kissing...

136
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,418
I also...

137
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,756
hate being snuck upon with a kiss.
Please watch for that.

138
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,551
(disbelieving grunt)
Hey, I hate it too!

139
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,136
Do you know how traumatic it is to ki...

140
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,807
kiss someone and see their future?

141
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,685
Also, why do you think that I would
sneak up on you with a kiss, huh?

142
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,895
Why is that?

143
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,233
Well, you tripped and kissed me
that one time,

144
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,028
and tried to kiss me when I got sick,
and asked for a kiss when you were drunk.

145
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,572
Well, those memories
are still pretty vivid for me.

146
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,658
(quirky music)

147
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,911
Let's just not kiss.

148
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,958
(sighs)

149
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,876
ARTICLE 3 (CONFIDENTIALITY)

150
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,003
ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS

151
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,588
This article won't work for me.

152
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,093
End our relationship after the realization
of the specific future?

153
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,302
Says who?

154
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,054
I'm going to sleep with you,

155
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,140
and I'm going to keep seeing you
after that.

156
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,600
If you want that too, of course.

157
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,228
Do you still want to end things
after sleeping with me?

158
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,647
(quirky music continues)

159
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,941
Uh...

160
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,527
I... I need to go to the bathroom.

161
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,699
(sighs)

162
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,868
(exhales deeply)

163
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,870
Why do I keep letting him
lead the conversation?

164
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,955
Why is he being so straightforward?

165
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,124
Why didn't I say anything? Am I stupid?

166
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,877
My gosh. Seriously.

167
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,712
(sighs)

168
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,797
(instrumental music)

169
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,307
(clears throat)

170
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,227
Shall we continue our conversation, then?

171
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,355
Just do whatever you want.

172
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,858
I'll do whatever I want, too.

173
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,778
So, when do you want
to come over to my place?

174
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,072
Uh...

175
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,285
Minhu?

176
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,370
(upbeat music)

177
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,919
(awkward grunt)

178
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,171
We were meeting with our client,

179
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,257
but they had to go
to the bathroom for a second.

180
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:01,221
We were discussing the details
of our contract...

181
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:05,934
But Ms. Hong, I thought
you dropped out of Mopix project.

182
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,063
-Oh, that's...
-Jiyoung.

183
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,148
We're on a date right now.

184
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,734
Could you leave us alone?

185
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,196
(quirky music)

186
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,203
(sighs)

187
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,623
(clicks)

188
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,500
Why did you tell her that?

189
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:33,962
Minhu!

190
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,547
So did you tell her your secret?

191
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,383
Is she dating you
after finding out all that?

192
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,510
(light music)

193
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,012
Did you tell her?

194
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,057
-We're late for our meeting, Jiyoung.
-(sighs)

195
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,183
Let's go.

196
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,645
(footsteps receding)

197
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,648
(sighs)

198
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,984
(engine revs)

199
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,075
I've been meaning to ask.

200
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,703
How do you know Ms. Oh?

201
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,247
And what's the secret she's talking about?

202
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,208
Do you have some secret you can't tell?

203
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,878
You said earlier that we shouldn't ask
each other about our secrets

204
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,339
and personal matters.
Do you want to hear it now?

205
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,883
No!

206
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,428
There's no need to share
all our private matters.

207
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,596
It's not like we're young 20-year-olds.

208
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:30,518
But we shouldn't create situations
that are easy to misread, don't you think?

209
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:31,978
She's my younger sister.

210
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,397
What?

211
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,150
Cha Minhu. Oh Jiyoung.

212
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,319
Your last names are different, though.

213
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:43,197
She's just like a younger sister
I've known since we were kids.

214
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,702
RECENTS

215
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,871
EDIT

216
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,916
(pensive music)

217
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,210
Huh?

218
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,921
Why does she look so familiar?

219
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,302
Aren't you going in?
Do you want to stay here a bit longer?

220
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,012
Excuse me?

221
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,390
They still haven't caught the burglar
who broke into your house.

222
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,642
Do you want me to stay with you tonight?

223
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,855
(stuttering)
You must be crazy.

224
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,231
My goodness.

225
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,400
(quirky music)

226
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,531
(laughs)

227
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,330
What's wrong with him?

228
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,207
Is he on something?

229
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,501
He's so different.

230
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,172
Huh?

231
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,516
WOMAN (on video): Go, go.

232
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,810
(Young Yesool laughs)

233
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,315
YOUNG JIYOUNG (on video): It's cold.

234
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,483
-(Young Jiyoung laughs)
-Huh?

235
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,402
(sighs)

236
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,989
The child actress in Dad's commercial
was Oh Jiyoung?

237
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,743
She's like his younger sister, huh?

238
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,411
Hmm.

239
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,624
Cha Minhu. I thought I knew him well,

240
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,960
but he keeps you guessing.

241
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,420
Jeez.

242
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,714
(gentle music)

243
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,552
What? You're dating?

244
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,719
Really?

245
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,182
You're really, really, really
dating Ms. Hong?

246
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,684
Yeah.

247
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,687
Oh, my God! This is big!

248
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,480
Hey, hey, since when?

249
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,567
No, wait, how did it happen?
No, why? Why, why, why?

250
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,988
Wow, Ms. Hong drank too much
Red Bomb again, huh?

251
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,239
My goodness.

252
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,993
(exhales deeply)
Cha Minhu, look at you. No wonder.

253
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:58,499
I was suspicious of you ever since
you kept hanging up on me.

254
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,625
And look what's happened.

255
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,545
Wow, you sly dog.
Cha Minhu, you, look at you.

256
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,505
I shouldn't have told you.

257
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,134
Hey, who else would you talk
to about stuff like this?

258
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,388
So, did you tell her?

259
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,390
Well, you know, now that you're together,

260
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,142
you should just tell her
about your condition...

261
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,393
I'm not going to.

262
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,853
What?

263
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,730
It's not like anything
will change even if I tell her.

264
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,274
It'll just become awkward between us.
Why should I tell her?

265
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,318
Well, so what?

266
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,112
You know, get through it together!
Just come clean!

267
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,364
I mean, your senses are
a bit more developed than others.

268
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,365
What's wrong with that?

269
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,659
So what if you collapse
when you kiss someone? Huh?

270
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:34,827
What do you mean, "so what"?

271
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,913
Are you saying that
because you really don't know?

272
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,625
I know what my girlfriend is doing
from 100m away,

273
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,044
and I know where she's been
and who she's met

274
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,129
just by her scent. And on top of all that,

275
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:48,883
I still don't know the side effects
that this could be causing inside my body,

276
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,595
and I don't even know how long
this condition is going to last.

277
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,224
And I'm supposed to ask her to understand
all that just because we're dating?

278
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,518
Well, I guess
she might worry a little bit.

279
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,519
I don't like it.

280
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,650
I don't want Yesool to mind me like that
and be uncomfortable with me.

281
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,362
I'll just be careful like I've been doing.

282
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,782
So you'd better watch what you say too.

283
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,742
Why would I say anything, huh?

284
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,913
By the way, what's got you smoking again?

285
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,793
Wow, you're psychic. Look at you.

286
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,631
I took a shower and everything.
I can't believe you sniffed that out.

287
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,967
Why? Did something happen at the hospital?

288
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,510
Hey.

289
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,763
Oh, never mind.

290
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,433
You got enough to deal with.
Why would I go on and whine to you?

291
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,727
What? What is it?

292
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,522
Never mind.
I'll tell you later when I get the chance.

293
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,523
Hey.

294
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,693
In any case, if you're going to hide it
from Ms. Hong, fine.

295
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,112
Just don't put up a wall
between you and her

296
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,406
or distance yourself. Okay?

297
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,908
That really hurts the other person
when you're in a relationship.

298
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,202
(sighs)

299
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,998
Hey, hey.

300
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,749
Here.

301
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:04,959
Yeah.

302
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,254
(slurping)

303
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,463
(bottles thud)

304
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,388
(sighs)

305
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,766
I know I put that somewhere.

306
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,484
(paper rustles)

307
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,282
I get that you're upset about dropping out
of Mopix, but you shouldn't do this,

308
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,992
dispatched Ms. Hong.

309
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,161
I finished all of my morning tasks.

310
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,330
I even emailed you all the files, Ms. Jo.

311
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,291
It seems that Production Team 1
is chaotic once again.

312
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,835
Perhaps we should pray that the curse
would lift off of Mopix or something.

313
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,587
Why?

314
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,589
FEEDBACK >>> STORY
THE SCENE WHERE THEY'RE SAYING GOODBYE

315
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,011
(sighs deeply)

316
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,638
SOMETHING MORE SIMPLE AND NOTICEABLE.

317
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,015
I know I sent them
a revised version yesterday,

318
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,475
but look at all this again.

319
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,143
(awkward laughter)

320
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,895
I think they do like it a lot.

321
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,106
This feedback
doesn't mean they don't like it...

322
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,818
Did you ever think how lines
about functions and product name

323
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,945
popping up would ruin the video?

324
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,073
(awkward laughter)

325
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,992
Why do you think
we call the client our "deity"?

326
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,996
Inside my folder, you'll see
copy edits, logo edits, feedback edits.

327
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,290
Edit, edit, edit.
It's not like it's someone's name.

328
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,918
It never ends.
(awkward laughter)

329
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,171
So, Director, instead of approaching this
like a work of art...

330
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,591
Of course, it's a work of art.
It's going to be a part of my filmography.

331
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,426
Right.

332
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,512
There's no right answer in art.

333
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,056
There's no set equation, either.

334
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,436
But in advertising,
we have to come close to the right answer.

335
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,148
-And actually, our client has that answer.
-(sighs)

336
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,943
Please make the edits.

337
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,445
What if I say I can't?

338
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,285
I don't know what that "right answer" is,
but didn't you hire me with all that money

339
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,870
so that I could break out of that mold?

340
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,583
(sighs)
Let's take a break.

341
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,214
(door opens)

342
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,757
(door closes)

343
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,930
(quirky music)

344
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,182
MINHEE: We haven't even started to film
the actual ad yet,

345
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,892
but I feel like I'm dying already.

346
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,353
SANGGOO: Director Lee
is so particular and sensitive.

347
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,604
What a mess.

348
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,232
ROMA: I guess he didn't get
to where he is for nothing.

349
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,985
MINHEE: They're starting round three!

350
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,780
ROMA: I can't get in touch with Oh Jiyoung
because she's ghosting us.

351
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,282
What do we do, Ms. Hong?

352
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,576
(playful music)

353
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,335
1. TURN OFF THE LIGHTS AT YOUR DESK

354
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:57,882
(sighs)

355
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,264
I'll be right back.

356
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,893
PILYO: Gosh.

357
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,355
I came here for Hong Yesool,
but you're not around.

358
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,649
It's all about edits, edits, and edits.
I'm in edit hell.

359
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,612
My ego is bruised
for the first time in my life.

360
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,781
I saw the video too.

361
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,867
The video itself isn't so bad,

362
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,536
but it's not impactful for a commercial.

363
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,497
It's too loose.

364
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,583
It was a stretch for Oh Jiyoung
to convey the concept, too.

365
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,794
(sighs)
I'm about to lose it.

366
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,796
Get some help.

367
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,548
Production teams and planning teams
aren't just there for show.

368
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,510
It's different than making movies
where you do things on your own.

369
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,639
I trusted you
since we worked so well as a team.

370
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,183
You know I always listen to you only.

371
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,232
Did you know that Ms. Oh
did a commercial for Mopix in the past?

372
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,070
Once you watch that clip,

373
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,739
I think this could help you.

374
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,616
Take a look at it.

375
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,411
CONNECTING TIME, RACING THROUGH LIFE

376
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:10,955
See you.

377
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,833
(light music)

378
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,591
SAYING GOODBYE

379
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,725
This is
Director Hong Sungjoon's commercial.

380
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,811
It swept all the awards that year.

381
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,145
I know that too.

382
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,356
That's Hong Yesool.

383
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:38,524
What?

384
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,777
What's Ms. Hong doing in there?

385
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,531
Director Hong Sungjoon
is Hong Yesool's father.

386
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,909
Ooh. Awesome.

387
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,536
Fast forward to the end.

388
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,329
Okay.

389
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,708
Doesn't she look familiar?

390
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,751
YOUNG JIYOUNG (on video): It's cold!
(laughs)

391
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,462
You're right.

392
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,755
She does seem familiar.

393
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,550
Does Ms. Hong have a younger sister?

394
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,804
How will you ever make it
as a director without an eye for it?

395
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,347
Come on.

396
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,558
Why would you bring that up?

397
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,102
I'm working really hard on my scripts.

398
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,438
That's actress Oh Jiyoung.

399
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,858
What? Oh Jiyoung?

400
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,110
Oh.

401
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,654
Wow, that's amazing.

402
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,033
The model from 25 years ago
is all grown up now,

403
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,910
and she's the model
for the same brand again.

404
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,997
Well, if you connect this to the concept,

405
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,874
I think we can end up
with something great.

406
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,211
(light music)

407
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,891
DAD FILMING JIYOUNG AND MOM

408
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,564
THE CAR CHANGES FROM
AN OLD ONE TO THE NEW ZELUS

409
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,943
Well, do you think this is closer
to the right answer?

410
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,321
I think utilizing actress
Oh Jiyoung to the max

411
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,156
could result in a commercial
that could influence the sales.

412
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,158
It's completely different
from the requested revisions,

413
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,242
but it's not bad.

414
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,536
Wow, when did you have the time to...

415
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,747
Ms. Hong gave me some ideas
and helped me out a lot.

416
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,457
Her reference materials helped a lot, too.

417
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,460
Then should we prepare the PT like this?

418
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,711
Sure, go ahead.

419
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,672
I'll communicate
the current situation to them.

420
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,758
It's just that my hands are tied
in the advertising world,

421
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,094
but I actually like doing a good job.

422
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,680
A true professional doesn't blame
the situation or the environment.

423
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,724
Besides, we don't know
if this is the right answer yet.

424
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,268
Hey.
(awkward laughter)

425
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,397
SANGGOO: Come on, you two.
You're like little kids...

426
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,398
(Sanggoo laughs)

427
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,275
You'll send us
the edited video today, right?

428
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,278
Sure thing. Ms. Hong said
that she would help me all night.

429
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,364
I've got all the help I need.

430
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,242
(clears throat)

431
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,995
(clears throat)

432
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,289
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

433
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,541
WING A

434
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,709
-Hello.
-Hello.

435
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,175
(sighs deeply)

436
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,432
(coughs)

437
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,561
He has symptoms such as phlegm,
coughing, and difficulty breathing.

438
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,229
Wait.
(inhales)

439
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,983
I want one of the PKs to finish reporting.
Who's ranked number one?

440
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,947
Yes. Judging from the phlegm, coughs,
and difficulties in breathing,

441
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,532
it seems like the patient
is displaying symptoms of a cold

442
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,908
and pneumonia that developed
over several months...

443
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,160
A cold and pneumonia?

444
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,749
One second, sir.

445
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,588
(inhales)
The crackles are really bad.

446
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,382
In this case, what are some
other possible diagnoses?

447
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,343
You could suspect emphysema,
but it's only been a few months

448
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,845
since he developed difficulties
in breathing,

449
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,181
and the chest radiography didn't
offer any other options.

450
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,932
As you know, difficulties in breathing

451
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,517
develop slowly over several years
with emphysema...

452
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,477
Never mind.

453
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,686
Any other possibilities?

454
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,898
You could consider
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,

455
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,024
where the lungs harden,

456
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,318
but symptoms
of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

457
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,195
such as clubbed fingers
have not been observed.

458
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,489
There were no symptoms
of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

459
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,865
in the chest radiography as well.

460
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,409
You're quick with a diagnosis,
as I've heard.

461
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,453
Do all of you agree?

462
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,579
(exhales deeply)

463
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,789
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

464
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,542
What about the color
of the patient's phlegm?

465
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,710
Did you check?

466
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,921
-Pardon?
-The color of his phlegm.

467
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,175
(light music continues)

468
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:41,391
RECEPTION, EXAMINATION ROOM,

469
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,603
WAITING ROOM, HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION
WINGS A-C, BATHROOM

470
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,024
(Seungtaek sighs)

471
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,822
If someone has IPF,
their phlegm will be whiteish.

472
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,490
But you excluded all other possibilities

473
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,783
just because there's no clubbing
of the fingers

474
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,076
and you saw the chest radiography results?

475
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,870
If you rush everything like that,
it saves you time,

476
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,288
but what about the patient?

477
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,335
Only 40 percent of the IPF patients
survive five years after the diagnosis!

478
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:10,879
I'm sorry, sir.

479
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,090
(dramatic music)

480
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,968
Check the chart for any suspicions
of the patient having IPF,

481
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,512
and get the patient's consent

482
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,389
to set a time
for the thoracoscopic lung biopsy.

483
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,348
Yes, sir.

484
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,351
(dramatic music continues)

485
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,316
(sighs)

486
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,405
(sighs deeply)

487
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,910
Shit, so annoying! Really.

488
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,788
Why does he keep picking on me?

489
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,040
It's not like we're elementary-aged kids.

490
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,878
He's so freaking childish.
What's with him?

491
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,463
(sighs)

492
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,883
-Right?
-(surprised grunt)

493
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,801
Do you know Dr. Oh?

494
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,011
Pardon?

495
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,888
Oh, well.

496
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,141
Yes, I know Dr. Oh Seungtaek.

497
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,476
I just know him as a professor.

498
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,647
No, I mean, he's not usually like that.

499
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,734
Last year, the PKs called him
"the Gyeongsang-do Uncle.”

500
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,360
Because he was so nice, like an uncle.

501
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:19,406
But he's being so picky this year.

502
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,949
To you.

503
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,577
Especially.

504
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,454
(awkward smile)

505
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,081
What is it, huh?

506
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,376
It's part of my job to take care
of matters like this in the middle.

507
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,795
-Just tell me a little bit. Do tell...
-No.

508
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,631
I have nothing to do with it.

509
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,215
All right then.

510
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,553
Ho... Howoo?

511
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,892
I know there's something there...

512
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,104
Here are our concept and materials
for the new commercial.

513
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,816
It's the story of the present day

514
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,735
after Mopix's V3 commercial
from 25 years ago.

515
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,362
Wow.

516
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,906
This is the first commercial
I was in charge of.

517
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,242
I was a newbie then

518
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,704
and Director Hong Sungjoon
looked after me a lot.

519
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,123
This brings back old memories.

520
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,333
(laughs)

521
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,877
This was Ms. Hong's idea.
The AE who dropped out,

522
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,004
taking responsibility
for the photo leaking incident.

523
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,256
She's also Director Hong's daughter.

524
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:21,677
(sighs)

525
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,888
He would have been so happy
if he were alive.

526
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,599
If only

527
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,310
that hadn't happened then.

528
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,438
(bitter laughter)

529
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,524
(dramatic music)

530
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,694
(music fades)

531
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,922
CINE-TALK ABOUT "HAROO" WITH CINEMA

532
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,644
(tired sigh)

533
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,452
I'm going to film it here.

534
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,871
While I was watching the commercial,

535
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,833
it was so clear how much
the father loves the daughter.

536
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,629
I know what that feels like.

537
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:44,384
You want to keep that person in your heart
and look at them, so you film them.

538
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,596
The way Director Hong Sungjoon filmed you.

539
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,015
I'm also going to make
the commercial with that mindset.

540
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,602
This project
became very special to me, too.

541
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,937
(calm music)

542
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,107
So, Yesool,

543
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,569
when are you going to go on
our second date?

544
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,032
I have to tell you something.

545
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,246
(laughs)

546
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:19,795
Excuse me.

547
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,214
I'm telling you,
I'm really dating Cha Minhu.

548
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,174
Wow, I haven't busted out laughing
like that in a while.

549
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,342
Seriously.
(laughing)

550
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,469
Unbelievable.

551
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:32,182
-Anyway, we are really dating, so...
-Stop.

552
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,726
Do you think that
you can get rid of me over that?

553
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,980
And while you and I were together,
you badmouthed him so much.

554
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,857
Do you really expect me to believe that?

555
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,238
(slurps)

556
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,657
(exclaims)

557
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,034
I'll kill that Cha Minhu.

558
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:55,288
I'm going to drink all this today,
and go kill him.

559
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,916
-Don't stop me.
-I won't.

560
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,292
LEESULO

561
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,837
-(slurps)
-(glass thuds)

562
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,922
-I have to go now. Don't stop me.
-I won't stop you.

563
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,090
-Don't stop me.
-I won't!

564
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,383
Just one more glass.

565
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,635

Yeah!

582
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:56,433
You don't have an IQ of 50
nor are you sadistic.

583
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,811
Oh, it just worked out that way.

584
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,354
Whether you believe me or not.

585
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,731
Tell me if it's true.

586
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,107
Tell you what?

587
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,860
How did you two start?

588
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,905
(light music)

589
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,329
(light music continues)

590
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,128
Oh.

591
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,671
Come on, really.

592
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,340
If you're going to come up
with such a scenario,

593
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,758
you should've started
from your first meeting him.

594
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,301
How is it so sloppy?

595
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,677
Let's go.

596
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,847
(strained grunt)

597
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,476
(sighs)

598
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,314
When I accepted three dates with you,

599
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,317
I didn't mean we'd start over again.

600
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:51,988
I just agreed to it because I felt that
we needed some time to have closure.

601
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,324
I didn't mean anything by it.

602
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,409
(soft music)

603
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,869
How come?

604
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,288
Because we wouldn't work out anyway?

605
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,583
(soft music continues)

606
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,422
What exactly did you see
that I can never be with you?

607
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,259
Oh...

608
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,427
What do you mean, what did I see?

609
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,641
Oh, never mind.

610
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,767
What?

611
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,603
Say it if you have something to say.

612
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,357
Why don't you ever say
what you want to say?

613
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,945
Would anything change if I said something?

614
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,530
How would you know?

615
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,409
Once again, you're not going to give me

616
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,495
that chance for things to change?

617
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,125
(light music)

618
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,670
What exactly did you see
that I can never be with you?

619
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,424
Once again, you're not going to give me
that chance for things to change?

620
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,180
I think we're going to have
to add more articles to our contract.

621
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,724
-What?
-I don't like it.

622
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,184
I didn't realize this before,

623
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:06,271
but I hate it when the woman I like
spends time with another man.

624
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,940
Oh, well...

625
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,359
I'm telling you this
because you don't know me that well.

626
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,569
But I could be a bit much.

627
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,070
Wh... What do you mean?

628
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,947
Being possessive and jealous.
Stuff like that.

629
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:17,949
Oh.

630
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,243
(pensive music)

631
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,706
What is it?

632
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,375
What's going on? Why...

633
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,335
(shushes)

634
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,502
It's Ms. Jo.

635
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,089
(Sunhee sighs)

636
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:36,134
Planning Team 1 upsets me so much.

637
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,886
Oh, I know.

638
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,554
It's reasonable for us to lose the bid.

639
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,433
-But they always compare us to them.
-So discouraging.

640
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,768
(sighs)

641
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,854
So, I was thinking
let's invest in Hong Yesool.

642
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,980
You're right.

643
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,899
We must get the PPM this time.

644
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,776
Hey, we'll all shave our heads
if we don't get it.

645
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,527
Oh, of course. I'll just die.

646
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,071
(Sunhee laughs)

647
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,781
(door closes)

648
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,034
But how did you know?

649
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,702
That Ms. Jo was coming in.

650
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,831
What? Are you a psychic?

651
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:09,918
Mr. Cha.

652
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,045
Aren't you curious?

653
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:13,546
About what?

654
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,839
The future that I saw.

655
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,009
You kept asking me about it,

656
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,636
but why don't you ask anymore?

657
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,305
You said we should date.
That must be the answer.

658
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,599
-You think I'm stupid?
-Huh.

659
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,310
I didn't start this
because of what you saw.

660
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,312
So we don't have to talk about
the future anymore.

661
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:33,733
By the way,

662
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,320
are you usually this straightforward
in a relationship?

663
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,949
How did you hold yourself back
all this time

664
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,368
when you're so relentless?

665
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,455
I have a question.

666
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,210
Why didn't you ask me out
if you had feelings for me all this time?

667
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,463
(sighs)

668
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,756
Do you really want to know?

669
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:00,301
FIVE YEARS AGO

670
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,387
(light music)

671
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,765
NAME, RESIDENT REGISTRATION NUMBER,
ADDRESS, CONTACT DETAILS, E-mail

672
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,142
Hong Yesool.

673
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,227
We meet at last.

674
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,021
(light music continues)

675
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,706
(music fades)

676
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,752
I'm your mentor.

677
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,088
Oh.

678
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,841
(quirky music)

679
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,846
(sighs)

680
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,144
You can't go dressed like that.

681
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,645
Not anywhere.

682
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,314
MINHU: You made it so obvious

683
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,399
that you had a boyfriend all along.

684
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,859
FOUR YEARS AGO

685
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,110
(sighs)

686
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,196
Cha Minhu, that son of a bitch.

687
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,533
The way he talks totally turns me off.
What a pervert.

688
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,244
He's dying to torture me 24/7.

689
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,831
You'll feel better once you fix your hair.

690
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,375
Feel better.

691
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,753
-Feel better!
-(Pilyo and Yesool laughs in distance)

692
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,962
Son of a bitch...

693
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,047
(awkward music sting)

694
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,799
Because I'm such a son of a bitch,

695
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,384
it wasn't easy for me to ask you out.

696
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,803
(awkward grunt)

697
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,429
(clears throat)

698
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,681
And, do you remember that day?

699
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:29,766
MINHU: Why are you crying?

700
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,809
Are you getting fired?

701
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:35,563
-Did your boyfriend break up with you?
-Yes, we broke up!

702
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,233
(sobbing)
So I can cry now, right?

703
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,485
(crying)

704
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,111
That bastard.

705
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,738
Come on, stop crying.

706
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,240
(sobbing)

707
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,868
MINHU: Why?

708
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,453
What?

709
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,579
(meat sizzling)

710
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,623
(sniffles)

711
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,920
(quirky music)

712
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,216
PIG INTESTINES, PORK BELLY, SKIRT STEAK

713
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,510
(Yesool sobbing)

714
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,303
(sighs)

715
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,682
-Oh, it's hot.
-It's hot?

716
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,059
-Hot. Drink water.
-(crying)

717
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,270
(quirky music continues)

718
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,191
(sighs)

719
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,113
(slurps)

720
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,325
I'm never...
(sniffles)

721
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,495
...going to date again.

722
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,914
Never in my life.

723
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,250
There will never be
another romantic relationship.

724
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,210
But still...

725
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,589
What do you mean, still?

726
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:49,095
I'm just going to work
like crazy from now on.

727
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,851
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!

728
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,436
(slurping)

729
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,857
-(breathes heavily)
-Hey! Hey.

730
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,276
(sighs)

731
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,738
Should I...

732
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,574
become a nun?

733
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,536
I'll just live with God.

734
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,955
No man for the rest of my life.

735
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:20,084
(gasps)
Let's... pray.

736
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,462
Amen.

737
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,589
(church music)

738
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,927
Aren't you going to pray?

739
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,179
Amen.

740
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,221
Louder!

741
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,640
-Amen.
-Amen!

742
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:34,641
Louder!

743
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,476
-Amen.
-Amen!

744
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,269
Amen!

745
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,854
Please forgive us.

746
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,814
Amen.

747
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,318
Hey, hey, hey.

748
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,319
Amen!

749
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,072
I'm just going to shave my head

750
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,700
like this, and just go
to a Buddhist temple

751
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,244
and train my mind. I'll do a good job.

752
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,623
I'm really good at doing this.

753
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,085
That, Amita... What... what was it again?

754
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,753
The Amitabha Pure Land Rebirth Mantra?

755
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,422
That's right. Amita...
What? One more time.

756
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,759
-Nam Amitabha...
-Nam Amitabha Buddha Guanyin Bodhisattva!

757
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:15,056
And then, did you say you wanted
to become a female monk after that?

758
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,475
(awkward laughter)

759
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:21,396
Oh, and, was it about two years ago?

760
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,149
And that concludes my presentation.

761
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,234
Thank you.

762
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,237
(applause)

763
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,576
(applause continues)

764
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,132
(thuds)

765
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,469
(pensive music)

766
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,517
Hong Yesool.

767
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,935
(frantic breathing)

768
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,187
Hong Yesool, Hong Yesool.

769
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,772
Hong Yesool!

770
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,609
Over here, to the left.

771
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,781
She totally passed out.
She didn't sleep for four days. Four days.

772
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,950
You should lay off a bit.
(clicks tongue)

773
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,702
Here.

774
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,999
-(Eomji sighs)
-Drink.

775
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,959
(slurps)

776
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,169
(grunt)

777
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,963
(smacks lips)
This is...

778
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,382
the real deal.

779
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,010
Master Cha wants to keep you for himself

780
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,389
while making you work late
and through the night.

781
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,641
While you're at it,

782
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,853
-just date him.
-Shut up!

783
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,813
Date Cha Minhu?

784
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:49,859
I would rather dunk my hands
into boiling water.

785
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,195
I guess you're going to burn your hands.

786
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:53,446
I will!

787
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,906
-Bring me some boiling water.
-Sure.

788
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,574
-(Minhu grunt)
-Hey.

789
00:42:57,617 --> 00:43:00,495
-Just drink the juice.
-Scared again, huh?

790
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,704
What?

791
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,539
(quirky music)

792
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,209
-Seungtaek.
-What?

793
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,212
Hands will heal if you dunk them
in boiling water, right?

794
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,713
Of course. You want to try it?

795
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,050
You said you'd dunk your hands
in boiling water if you ever dated me.

796
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,468
I tried to protect your hands.

797
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,804
(awkward laughter)

798
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,974
When and how did you hear all that?

799
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,311
Did you plant a bug on me or something?

800
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,938
Are you monitoring me?

801
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,564
That's weird.

802
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,776
I made sure you weren't around
when I badmouthed you.

803
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,030
Are you an alien or something?

804
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,157
Or have a special power?

805
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,160
(gulps)

806
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,412
(light music)

807
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,380
Speak for yourself. You see the future
when you kiss someone.

808
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:53,965
Oh.

809
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,759
I'll get going now.

810
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:58,761
Oh!

811
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,014
I want to add the last special clause
to our contract.

812
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:06,310
Kissing.

813
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,146
I'll do it if I want to.

814
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,439
Well, I'll find a way.

815
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,402
And, if we kiss, you should just...

816
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,529
sleep over that night.

817
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,365
Bye.

818
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,492
(emotional music)

819
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,332
(gasps)

820
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,336
Wow. What the heck...

821
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,672
Gosh.

822
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,425
Why did my heart jump when he said that?

823
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,260
Are you a pervert, Yesool?

824
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:40,761
(gasps)

825
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,430
He's not listening to this, too, is he?

826
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,266
-YESOOL: What the heck...
-(soft chuckle)

827
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,686
(whooshing)

828
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,275
(gasps)

829
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:58,863
Isn't she just gorgeous?
(exclaims)

830
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,532
It really accentuates your curves
even though we're just doing fitting.

831
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:04,076
Ms. Oh, you're stunning.

832
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,912
MANAGER: Yes, that's right.

833
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,038
Jiyoung.

834
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,498
You're the prettiest woman in a dress
that I've seen.

835
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:10,875
(manager grunts)

836
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,087
Why aren't you saying anything, Mr. Cha?

837
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,715
I called you here because I thought

838
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,717
we should make a final decision
on the dress.

839
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,095
I'm sorry, but could you give us a minute?

840
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,472
-WOMAN: Sure.
-MANAGER: Yes, sir.

841
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,599
Please make yourselves comfortable.

842
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,645
(door closes)

843
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:41,030
I heard that Hong Yesool
is Director Lee Pilyo's ex?

844
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,160
I guess you knew?

845
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,413
Didn't you see the draft I sent you?

846
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,666
I thought I said we needed a design
that allows for movement

847
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,752
since you're not going
to be standing still for the commercial.

848
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,587
I read it.

849
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,838
I did,

850
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:01,092
but I've eaten only ten cherry tomatoes

851
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,677
and one sweet potato for a week.

852
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,930
That's how I got this figure.

853
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,683
So, if I can't wear the dress I want,

854
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,812
do you think I'd be annoyed or not?

855
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,106
And if I get annoyed,

856
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,900
I'd just let it out
wherever I might be at.

857
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,069
Do you think you can handle that, Minhu?

858
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,153
Hey, Oh Jiyoung.

859
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,576
Have fun dating Hong Yesool.

860
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,370
Now that I think about it,

861
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,498
your relationship
won't last that long anyway.

862
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:36,210
So if I stress about it,
that'd just be my loss.

863
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:39,839
You're not going to tell Hong Yesool
about it,

864
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:42,591
and you couldn't even kiss her anyway.

865
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:45,052
A relationship like that
won't last that long.

866
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,971
-Isn't that right?
-No, you're wrong.

867
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,974
I'm going to kiss Hong Yesool.

868
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,059
(dramatic music)

869
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:54,312
What?

870
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,856
So you're going to collapse
every time you kiss her?

871
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:57,982
Are you crazy, Minhu?

872
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,234
It'll be fine
if Hong Yesool is by my side.

873
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,363
So you'll overcome it
with the power of love?

874
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,117
-Does that make sense?
-Of course, it doesn't make sense.

875
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,077
I couldn't believe it at first, either.

876
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,954
I told Dr. Oh about it, too.

877
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,914
My symptoms ease up
when I'm with Hong Yesool.

878
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,709
Well, that's not why I'm dating her,

879
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,919
but the reason I'm telling you this

880
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,547
is so that you can stop worrying about me.

881
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,466
So...

882
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,385
if you kiss Hong Yesool,

883
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,512
you get better?

884
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:29,847
To be exact,

885
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:33,893
the symptoms ease up
when she's near me, and I feel better.

886
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,145
(snorts)
Minhu.

887
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,105
Do you expect me to believe that?

888
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,483
It's up to you
whether you believe it or not.

889
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,193
(sighs)

890
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,611
Jiyoung.

891
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,156
You're more important to me
than my own family.

892
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:50,951
I don't want our friendship to suffer.

893
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:56,082
So let's not put any more strain
on our relationship, okay?

894
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,541
I'll see you on the set.

895
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,586
I'll talk with the director
about changing your dress.

896
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:05,800
(disbelieving grunt)

897
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,763
(sobs)

898
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,141
(waves crashing)

899
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,477
(suspenseful music)

900
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,485
(suspenseful music continues)

901
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,575
(grunts)

902
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:33,494
(exhales deeply)

903
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:35,955
(sighs)

904
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,499
(groans)

905
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,420
(sighs)

906
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,713
(pensive music)

907
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:54,557
LUXURY LAUNDROMAT
CLEANING, WASHING, STITCHING

908
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,935
EXEMPLARY BUSINESS

909
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:58,894
(sighs)

910
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,605
YESOOL: I had no idea
so many people were busy

911
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,524
on the third Saturday of every month.

912
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,948
NOEL ORPHANAGE

913
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,701
(calm music)

914
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,169
WELCOME TO NOEL ORPHANAGE!

915
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,342
(calm music continues)

916
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:37,141
(snorts)
What's he doing that's so important

917
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,852
that he hasn't called me at all
when it's the weekend?

918
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,313
Wait.

919
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,690
I wonder if he's ever been
in a relationship before.

920
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,567
Hmm.

921
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,488
(clanks)

922
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,825
Hong Yesool.

923
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:57,912
Mom?

924
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:01,707
(grunts)

925
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,084
You've gotten a bit older
since the last time I saw you!

926
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,379
-Gosh, what in the world!
-(laughs)

927
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:08,589
When did you get here?

928
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,133
(laughs)
Just now.

929
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,594
Wait, did you say I look older? Really?

930
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,346
-(laughs)
-Hmph.

931
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,515
I came straight from the airport,

932
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:20,226
but I couldn't reach you,
and the front door passcode was changed.

933
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,602
I waited a long time.

934
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,313
Well, you should've told me
you were coming.

935
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:26,732
Then I could've picked you up
at the airport.

936
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,652
That's no fun, though.
I wanted to surprise you!

937
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:32,696
I didn't tell you I was coming
so I could see the shock on your face.

938
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,534
When are you going to grow up?
Sixty is right around the corner for you.

939
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:40,454
Hey, people think I'm in my early 40s.

940
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:44,124
Gosh, don't believe people like that.
They're scamming you.

941
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,585
They'll come looking
to sell something to you.

942
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,838
You haven't changed at all.
You're such a stickler.

943
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,507
Your dad wasn't like that.

944
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,842
Oh, right.

945
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,011
I heard that you're doing
a Mopix commercial this time.

946
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,972
-Huh?
-(laughs lightly)

947
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,098
Yeah.

948
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,393
Your dad must be so happy in heaven.

949
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:04,812
Mom.

950
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,816
When I was little,
did I ever fall into something?

951
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,943
(dramatic music)

952
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,279
Why do you bring that up all of a sudden?

953
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,031
Well, I've been having
these weird dreams lately.

954
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,576
Hey, just quit your job.

955
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,495
They must be working you so hard
that you have weird dreams.

956
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:22,705
What are you saying...

957
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,416
You just said that Dad would be happy.

958
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,586
Do you have those dreams often lately?

959
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,422
Not often. Just a few times.

960
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:36,260
You know how you said Dad and I
got into a car accident?

961
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,555
But how come I have no memory of it?

962
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,098
It's a good thing.

963
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:43,100
If anything, I'm grateful for that.

964
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,561
So that you can live
with only good memories.

965
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,981
Anyway, are you seeing anyone?

966
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,359
Even I'm getting married at this age
because someone fell for me.

967
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,320
Yet you're young and alone on the weekend?

968
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:56,905
Oh.

969
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:58,741
I do have someone.

970
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,910
But he has something to do
on the third week of every month.

971
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:04,413
What? You're seeing someone?

972
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,581
Who is it?

973
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,208
When can I meet him?

974
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:10,919
Let me see how you behave.

975
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,506
You brat.
(laughs)

976
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,800
(indistinct chatter)

977
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,432
YOUNG YESOOL: Are you a baby?

978
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:28,312
You should clench your fists
and hold back your tears like that.

979
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,064
YOUNG MINHU: So what?

980
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:35,069
I heard that crying makes you stronger.

981
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,240
YOUNG YESOOL: Play with me!

982
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,118
(light music)

983
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,292
What are you thinking about so intensely?

984
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:52,503
(laughs lightly)

985
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,254
(distant indistinct chatter)

986
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,887
-Hello.
-Hello.

987
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:02,971
Hi.

988
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:08,310
Thank you for always visiting us

989
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,521
and counseling our children, Doctor.

990
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,858
I should be the one to thank you.
I feel better after being with the kids.

991
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:16,860
(laughs)

992
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,987
Have you been well, Minhu?

993
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:22,825
-Yes.
-Um.

994
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:27,413
As you know, he's always been
a man of few words.

995
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:28,747
(both laugh)

996
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,291
It's all right.
(laughs)

997
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:34,086
I've known him ever since
he was at the orphanage.

998
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,964
And I know that he cares a lot

999
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,008
about our orphanage
even though he doesn't say much.

1000
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:41,885
(laughs lightly)

1001
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:45,347
(sighs)

1002
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,101
KYUNGSOO: Time sure flies.

1003
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,229
Was it somewhere around here?
About this time of the year?

1004
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,981
The place where your symptoms manifested?

1005
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,443
You told me to focus on the sound
that I wanted to hear.

1006
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,320
But I want to know
if I'm just controlling my senses

1007
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,198
or if it's a special thing with her.

1008
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,409
I didn't have any symptoms
after that, either.

1009
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,577
Really?

1010
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,954
Could you introduce me to her?

1011
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,664
Sure, if I get the chance.

1012
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,291
But Doctor.

1013
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:16,670
Do you think one could blackout
if they're traumatized by some incident?

1014
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:17,796
Sure.

1015
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,550
Humans try to protect themselves

1016
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,136
above everything else,
consciously or unconsciously.

1017
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,306
If it was a huge shock and trauma,

1018
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,850
then they could've erased it intentionally

1019
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,269
or they could just pretend
it doesn't exist.

1020
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,064
Is it possible to selectively erase
the memories

1021
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,691
related to a certain place or person?

1022
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,986
It's not common,
but it's not entirely impossible, either.

1023
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,823
You're asking
a lot of questions today, Minhu.

1024
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:45,866
(laughs lightly)

1025
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,326
Just one more thing.

1026
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,830
Are there any other case studies like me
in other regions or countries?

1027
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,624
Well, yeah.

1028
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,835
I've attended many conferences
and have read some research papers.

1029
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,005
Then, is there a case where some people

1030
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,257
who were in the same place
at the same time

1031
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,384
all developed the same symptoms?

1032
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,727
(dramatic music)

1033
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,401
(sighs)

1034
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,910
(dramatic music continues)

1035
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,630
WOMAN (on video): Mopix.

1036
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,925
Connecting time.

1037
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,848
Racing through life together.

1038
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,269
(light music playing)

1039
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,816
Thank you, Mopix.

1040
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,823
I'm still with you.

1041
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,284
(sighs)

1042
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,077
CONNECTING TIME, RACING THROUGH LIFE
I'M STILL WITH YOU

1043
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:20,877
Four meters, 900 kilogram, 25 years.

1044
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,965
Our time and memories
are contained in those numbers,

1045
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,758
whether we want it to or not.

1046
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:30,554
Just like how no one had realized that
Ms. Oh was the little girl in this video.

1047
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,098
But this car had remembered it
for a long time.

1048
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,976
This commercial,
which is a part of this video,

1049
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,979
was a commercial
that was created 25 years ago,

1050
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,480
when Mopix V3 was launched.

1051
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,442
The interesting thing is that
both of the people in this video

1052
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,776
have a connection to Mopix.

1053
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,154
As you all know, one of them

1054
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,822
is our model Ms. Oh Jiyoung, the actress,

1055
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,993
and the other person is both the star
and inspiration of this commercial,

1056
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,703
AE Ms. Hong Yesool.

1057
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,289
And the creator of this commercial is...

1058
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:01,084
The father of Ms. Hong Yesool.

1059
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,338
Director Hong Sungjoon.

1060
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,340
How did you know?

1061
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:11,386
Mr. Cha came to see me every day,
telling me about the meeting content

1062
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:15,015
and tried to rebuild trust.

1063
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,142
He gave me a lot of materials
on Ms. Hong as well,

1064
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,770
saying that she was
in charge of this project.

1065
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,147
(light music)

1066
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,651
I really like this.

1067
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,654
Let's go with this.

1068
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,240
(laughs lightly)

1069
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,496
Also, I would like Ms. Hong
to be in charge of this.

1070
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:41,875
It's been 25 years.
I think it'll be very meaningful.

1071
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,419
(light music continues)

1072
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:49,925
(indistinct chatter)

1073
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:54,179
(music fades)

1074
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,474
(sighs)

1075
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,102
It really turned out
the way Mr. Cha had predicted.

1076
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:07,651
Let's just wrap this up
by sending Ms. Hong to Planning Team 2.

1077
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,737
If we don't do that,
we can't stop our auditing department

1078
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:13,281
nor Mopix's audits.

1079
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:19,579
What will you do if Mopix wants Ms. Hong
to get involved in this project?

1080
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,623
Hmm...

1081
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,835
Do you have something in mind?

1082
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:26,712
If that happens,

1083
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,631
please promise me
that you'll reinstate her right away.

1084
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,969
We'll put Ms. Hong on it right away.

1085
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,763
(light music)

1086
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,810
(sighs)

1087
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:50,026
Do you want to be in charge
of the lingerie PPM coming up?

1088
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,820
Let us, Planning Team 2,

1089
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,990
get off to a good start
with our new member.

1090
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:56,992
Let's go for some cash bonus.

1091
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,078
Let's have our team highlight
be displayed in the lobby, too.

1092
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,622
I won't make you
work late like you-know-who.

1093
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,208
I think she'll have to work late.

1094
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,253
Mr. Cha, what are you saying,
showing up out of nowhere?

1095
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,046
I just got approval to reinstate Ms. Hong.

1096
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,465
What?

1097
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,967
She'll go back
to Planning Team 1, as of now.

1098
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,178
(uplifting music)

1099
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,101
Congratulations! It feels so new
and special now that you're back!

1100
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:24,603
Welcome, Ms. Hong!

1101
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,896
I drew that heart.

1102
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,899
-Thank you, everyone.
-(Sanggoo laughs)

1103
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,277
It's going to get busy around here,

1104
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,696
so make sure to take care
of your own schedules and health.

1105
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,866
I would like you to know
that we would be so happy

1106
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,242
if we got busier than we are now.

1107
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,619
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

1108
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,996
Put Ms. Hong in charge of everything
that's been going on.

1109
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:43,997
Yes.

1110
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,209
(uplifting music continues)

1111
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,462
Congratulations, Ms. Hong.

1112
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,214
Thanks.

1113
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,927
(sighs)

1114
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,224
REGARDING MOPIX

1115
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:05,185
(keyboard clacking)

1116
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,604
(phone buzzing)

1117
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,898
LEE PILYO

1118
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:11,900
Hello.

1119
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,402
You heard, right?
Congratulations on your reinstatement.

1120
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,529
Thank you, Director.

1121
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,156
Once again, I look forward
to working with you, Ms. Hong.

1122
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,826
All right. Shall we have a meeting
on our schedule today?

1123
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:21,952
What do you want to do?

1124
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,787
Should I go there, or
do you want to come here?

1125
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:24,913
What works for you?

1126
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,791
Never mind.
I'll go to the office right now.

1127
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,417
Okay.

1128
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:33,004
Oh, the papers!
(strained grunt)

1129
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:35,507
(paper rustles)

1130
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:40,428
(sighs)

1131
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:47,936
POST-EVENT AGREEMENT (EDITED)

1132
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,063
(dramatic music)

1133
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,199
Oh...

1134
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:04,911
(paper rustling)

1135
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:08,623
(phone buzzing)

1136
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,213
PILYO: I don't think that
we should talk about this at work.

1137
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:16,464
Come to our hangout.

1138
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,344
I'M COMING PALME D'OR HOLLYWOOD!
I'M GOING TO GET IT!

1139
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,471
(dramatic music)

1140
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,602
Did something happen to you
while I was gone?

1141
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:31,271
I realize that there have been
many surprises ever since I got back.

1142
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,606
But this isn't even funny.

1143
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,733
For the first time,
I want to agree with what you said

1144
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,860
about how you're not
the same Hong Yesool I used to know.

1145
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,614
The contract will be terminated
as soon as the future is realized?

1146
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,240
What does this mean?

1147
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,410
Don't you know how people are these days?

1148
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,787
People want to have proof
even in their relationships.

1149
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,999
I just suggested to Mr. Cha that
we should date to fit the current trend.

1150
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,375
I was just messing with him.

1151
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:54,961
What kind of future did you see
with Cha Minhu?

1152
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,631
We just settled on a secret code for us.

1153
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,967
Don't you know that
lovers do all kinds of things?

1154
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,637
I mean, even when we were dating,

1155
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,889
we didn't want our friends to find out
since we were a campus couple.

1156
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,682
So we came up with our own codewords.

1157
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,517
(sighs)

1158
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,813
It's private. Keep your nose out of it.

1159
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:16,232
Do you draft a legal document
about something that's so private?

1160
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:19,402
You're dating Cha Minhu
while writing contracts like these?

1161
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,112
And you want me to believe that right now?

1162
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:23,490
(dramatic music continues)

1163
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,495
I was going to wait

1164
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:30,705
until you told me about it.

1165
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,461
But I can't wait any longer.

1166
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,755
I don't think
you'll ever tell me about it.

1167
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:42,842
The reason you're dating Cha Minhu

1168
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:46,388
is the same as the reason
you broke up with me, right?

1169
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:51,810
I always knew

1170
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,688
that you can see the future.

1171
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,902
(closing theme music)
