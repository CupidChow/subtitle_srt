00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,588
(water bubbling)

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,014
YESOOL: When did I start

4
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:17,184
having this dream?

5
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,104
Is this a dream too?

6
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,527
It must be.

7
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,697
Then...

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,076
it's time for me to wake up now.

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,996
I don't know what happens after this.

10
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,045
(suspenseful music)

11
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,345
(bubbling)

12
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,432
(Minhu blows)

13
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,984
HAEJIN: It's all because of you!

14
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,612
You're the one who put Yesool in danger!

15
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,616
I told you to get away from Yesool!

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,868
-(Haejin grunts)
-(Minhu groans)

17
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,245
(Haejin grunts)

18
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,832

19
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,960
(fainted grunt)

20
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,255
(breathes deeply)

21
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,636
(softly)
Mr. Cha.

22
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,683
(suspenseful music stops)

23
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,647
Mr. Cha.

24
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,444
(grunting)

25
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,781
No.
(breathes deeply)

26
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,451
Mr. Cha, wake up.

27
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,829
No.
(sobbing)

28
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,664
Come on, open your eyes.

29
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:03,832
Mr. Cha.

30
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,375
Mr. Cha.

31
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,544
Mr. Cha!

32
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,379
Mr. Cha!
(sobbing continues)

33
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,966
(Yesool sobbing)

34
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,805

EPISODE 12

37
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,110
(tires screech)

38
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,320
Kim Haejin!

39
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,655
Who are you?

40
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,365
-Let go of me!
-Grab him!

41
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,659
Let go!
(screaming)

42
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,580
You are under arrest for
the murder of Mr. Hong in the year 2000.

43
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:47,084
You have the right to consult an attorney,
and you have the right to remain silent.

44
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,669
You may refuse to answer any questions.

45
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,629
-Take him.
-Yes, sir.

46
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,632
(somber music)

47
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,553
(grunting)

48
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,057
I didn't kill him.

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,975
I didn't kill him. I'm Yesool's father.

50
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,310
I didn't kill him.

51
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,396
I'm Yesool's father. I'm her father.

52
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,772
(sobbing)

53
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,190
OFFICER: Here! Over here!

54
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,318
(Yesool sobbing)

55
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,197
(Yesool breathes deeply)

56
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,666
(siren blaring)

57
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,543
-How are his vitals?
-OFFICER: They're dropping.

58
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,920
There's a deep 5-cm stab wound,
and the bleeding is bad.

59
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,005
(Yesool sobbing)

60
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,259
You can't go in here.

61
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,599
AMBULANCES ONLY

62
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,105
(sobbing)
No.

63
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,025
Yesool.

64
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,862
Mom.

65
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,947
(sobbing continues)

66
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,450
(music stops)

67
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,334
Yesool.

68
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,463
I'm sure that Minhu will be fine.

69
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,801
You knew everything, didn't you?

70
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,558
Mr. Cha and I...

71
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,979
have known each other
since we were young, right?

72
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,106
(light music)

73
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,612
(young Yesool sobbing)

74
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,657
WELCOME NOEL ORPHANAGE

75
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,286
(sobbing continues)

76
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,213
Who are you?

77
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,381
Are you new here?

78
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,635
Where are you from?

79
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,929
Seoul.

80
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,265
Why aren't you going inside?

81
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,146
Did your mom tell you
to wait here for a minute?

82
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,440
That she'll come back for you?

83
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,612
Well, she lied.

84
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,869
Want to know
what's going to happen to you?

85
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,414
No matter how long you wait,

86
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,166
she's not coming back.

87
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,418
(sobbing)

88
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,880
If you cry like that,

89
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,509
you'll only make it
hard and painful for yourself.

90
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,594
It'll be your loss.

91
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,805
Don't waste your energy.

92
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,395
(sobbing)
I'm lost.

93
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,858
I moved here today.

94
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,533
You moved here?

95
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,452
It's a two-story red-brick house.

96
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,206
But I don't know where it is.

97
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,793
(sobbing continues)

98
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,629
Follow me.

99
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,885
Come on.

100
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,312
(light music)

101
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,280
(dog barking in distance)

102
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,326
Is this it? This is your house?

103
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,911
No, it's not.

104
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,750
Okay. Let's try another house, then.

105
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,588
(light music)

106
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,888
YOUNG MINHU: I think this might be it.

107
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,558
It looks similar,
but it's not the right one.

108
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,102
Really?

109
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,647
SMILE GROCERY STORE

110
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,610
Excuse me.

111
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,447
She just moved into
a two-story red-brick house.

112
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,616
Do you know where it is?

113
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,243
I'm not sure.

114
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,579
Thank you.

115
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,832
(sighs)

116
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,963
(tire screech)

117
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,304
(foreboding music)

118
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,439
(sighs)

119
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,861
(exhales deeply)

120
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,374
Mom!

121
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,917
Yesool!

122
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,918
Yesool!

123
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,003
(Sara gasping)

124
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,550
(Sara sobbing)
I'm so sorry.

125
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,847
-Are you hurt?
-No.

126
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,269
YOUNG YESOOL:
I was scared, but that boy helped me.

127
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,771
Hey, wait a minute.

128
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,485
I'm Yesool's father.

129
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,112
What's your name?

130
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,406
Minhu.

131
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,866
Okay, Minhu.

132
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,451
Thanks.

133
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,703
Where do you live?

134
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,289
I want to thank your parents
or something...

135
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,334
I don't have any.

136
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,005
I don't have any.

137
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,256
Parents, I mean.

138
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,761
I live...

139
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,221
at an orphanage.

140
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,475
Okay. I'm sorry.

141
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,352
Then I can just thank you, right?

142
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,901
Thank you so much
for taking care of Yesool.

143
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,486
Thanks.

144
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,323
We'll be sure
to pay you a visit next time.

145
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,407
Okay.

146
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,826
Goodbye.

147
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,501
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

148
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,463
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

149
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,344
SUNGJOON: Look at your mom.

"Little Red Riding Hood and the granny

Little Red Riding Hood,
who was saved by the hunter,

152
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,650
lived with the granny happily ever after."

LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD

154
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,573
I'm sorry, Yesool.

155
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,245
Mommy and Daddy are both sorry
for leaving you alone.

156
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,963
But you made a friend
as soon as you moved here.

157
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,090
He's not my friend.

158
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,258
He's not?

159
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,678
You read to me when I can't sleep,

160
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,639
and you're with me all the time.

161
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,432
But a friend can't do that.

162
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,229
So, I'm going to become
his family instead.

163
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,398
Do you like him that much?

164
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,024
Yes. I do.

165
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,611
I like you more, though.

166
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,530
Dad.

167
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,159
Let's live happily ever after,
just like in the storybooks.

168
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,619
Of course.

169
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,795
Where's my stuff? Where is it?

170
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,297
It's not here!

171
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,174
You stole it, didn't you?

172
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,842
You did. Tell me.

173
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,677
Spill it!

174
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,554
YOUNG YESOOL:
Don't you dare mess with him!

175
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,352
(panting)

176
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,946
(light music)

177
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,332
(Young Yesool yells)

178
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,002
Let's just go.

179
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,758
(quirky music)

180
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,097
Are you a baby?

181
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,433
Whatever.

182
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,644
You're younger than me.

183
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,406
(light music)

184
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,788
You think you can just clench your fists

185
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,748
and hold back your tears,

186
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,708
and everything will be fine?

187
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,549
If you want to cry, you should cry.
That means you're strong.

188
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,468
That's what Dad said.

189
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,347
If you're happy, laugh.
If you're annoyed, complain.

190
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,185
He said that's what strong people do.

191
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,653
I can take care of those kids for you.

192
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,493
So play with me.

193
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,288
(light music)

194
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,723
Is it not there?

195
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,685
No. Let me look just a bit more.

196
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,397
(water sloshing)

197
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,274
(both laugh)

198
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,277
That's cold!

199
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,154
YOUNG YESOOL: Stop it!

200
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,489
YOUNG MINHU: Stop it, you.

201
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,575
(both laugh)

202
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,494
"He wanted to go on an adventure.

203
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,873
He wanted to catch bigger
and tastier fish.

204
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,877
Kimi made up his mind,
and ran to ask his parents.

205
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,589
'Mom, Dad, may I go to
the seaside village tomorrow?'

206
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,299
'Sure.'"

207
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,427
(light music)

208
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,399
(birds chirping)

209
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,986
Minhu, your painting is...

210
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,073
It's very dreamlike.

211
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,743
Why don't you use
your favorite color right here?

212
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,537
-How about yellow?
-Sure.

213
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,372
I'll help, Minhu.

214
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,582
Let's do it together.

215
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,377
(playful music)

216
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,309
YOUNG YESOOL: Look.

217
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,436
What color did you use?

218
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,396
YOUNG YESOOL: Green and pink.

219
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,232
YOUNG MINHU: Green and pink?

220
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,525
That's so pretty.

221
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,734
YOUNG YESOOL: Right?

222
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,820
REPORTER:
We're predicting heavy rain tomorrow.

223
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,656
We're also expecting to see
the first super blood moon in 22 years,

224
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,826
which is a combination
of a total lunar eclipse and super moon.

225
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:14,247
The Native Americans used to believe that
a super blood moon would grant you a wish.

226
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,833
Let's hope it appears
through the heavy rainfall.

227
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,544
We also hope to become
such a miracle for you as well.

228
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,505
That's all we have for you today.
Thank you for watching.

229
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:27,969
It's Dad's ad.

230
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,805
Oh, is that me?

231
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,267
You're awesome, Dad!

232
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,523
How do you make an advertisement?

233
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,776
Hmm.

234
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:45,987
You just need to...

235
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,072
love people.

236
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,783
What does that mean?

237
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,744
Making an advertisement

238
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,749
is sharing what you have with others.

239
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:05,631
So, if you have jealousy in your heart,
you'll just end up sharing jealousy.

240
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,259
If you have hate, then you'll share hate.

241
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:12,597
But if you have kindness,

242
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,183
then you can share
that kindness with others.

243
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,226
If you have love,

244
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,437
you can share love too.

245
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,022
For me,

246
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,399
that's what advertisements are.

247
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,199
YOUNG MINHU: It's raining so much
all of a sudden.

248
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,329
Let's go inside.

249
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,538
YOUNG YESOOL: It's cold.

250
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,209
(young Minhu breathes deeply)
You had fun today, right?

251
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,085
YOUNG YESOOL:
Yes. Let's do it again tomorrow.

252
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,214
What's wrong?

253
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,216
Aren't you going inside?

254
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,051
Hmm?

255
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,264
Is somebody there?

256
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,309
(tense music)

257
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,731
YOUNG MINHU: Be quiet.

258
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,484
Why?

259
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,613
Yesool.

260
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,824
Close your eyes really tight

261
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,077
and just count to ten.

262
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,746
I'll be right back.

263
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,665
-(thunder rumbles)
-Okay.

264
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,384
-YOUNG YESOOL: One. Two.
-(young Minhu panting)

265
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,477
Seven.

266
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,605
(thunder rumbling)

267
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:49,944
YOUNG YESOOL: Minhu.

268
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,406
(gasps)
Yesool!

269
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,658
(ominous music)

270
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,118
-YOUNG MINHU: Come on, quick.
-YOUNG YESOOL: Why?

271
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,619
Quickly!

272
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,372
(ominous music continues)

273
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,793
-Careful.
-Okay.

274
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,215
(breathes deeply)

275
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,886
YOUNG MINHU: What do I do?

276
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,099
Hurry.

277
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,352
(both panting)

278
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,731
(Haejin grunts)

279
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,067
(pants)

280
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,659
(panting continues)

281
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,831
(breathes heavily)

282
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,587
-YOUNG YESOOL: Ouch!
-YOUNG MINHU: Hey!

283
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,172
Are you okay?

284
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,383
Minhu, I'm tired.
(panting)

285
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,177
Where are we going?

286
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,762
Sorry.

287
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,806
But we have to go. Come on, let's go.

288
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,310
Let's go, come on.

289
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,188
(foreboding music)

290
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,199
(both panting)

291
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,701
Yesool.

292
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,245
I need you to hide here for a little bit.

293
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,665
I'll come back

294
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,500
for you.

295
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,127
Remember when we were playing

296
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,171
hide-and-seek?

297
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,973
(Haejin pants)

298
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,855
(foreboding music)

299
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,133
YOUNG MINHU: Yesool! Wait!

300
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,177
(suspenseful music)

301
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,807
(breathes heavily)

302
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,527
(panting)

303
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,202
(foreboding music)

304
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,598
Yesool.

305
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,683
Minhu, over here!

306
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,852
(yelps)

307
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,564
(ominous music)

308
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,862
Yesool!

309
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,326
(ominous music continues)

310
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,800
(dramatic music)

311
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,111
(dramatic music continues)

312
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,331
Yesool, let's go.

313
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,376
(young Minhu grunting)

314
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,509
Wake up, Yesool.

315
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,177
Yesool.

316
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,265
Yesool.

317
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,141
Yesool.

318
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,854
(panting)

319
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,654
What do I do?

320
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,365
(panting continues)

321
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,957
Yesool.

322
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,250
Can you hear me?

323
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,753
Yesool.

324
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,216
(blows)

325
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,722
(light music)

326
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,572
Yesool.
(panting)

327
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,870
(young Minhu grunts)

328
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,296
(breathes heavily)

329
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,310
(coughs)

330
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,395
(breathes rapidly)

331
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,864
(breathes heavily)

332
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,620
Wake up, Yesool.

333
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,789
Yesool.

334
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,794
(dramatic music)

335
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,762
(breathes deeply)

336
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,032
The same thing happened back then.

337
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,246
Back then, he tried to save me...

338
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,834
Yesool.

339
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,254
Do you remember everything?

340
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,674
(somber music)

341
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,146
Yesool.

342
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,772
Can you hear me?

343
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,233
It's Mom.

344
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,581
Where...

345
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,583
Where am I?

346
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,339
Where's Dad?

347
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,178
Is he not here yet?

348
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,058
Where's Dad?

349
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,689
SARA: It took you two days to wake up.

350
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,442
I don't know
if it was a good or bad thing,

351
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,027
but you didn't remember anything.

352
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,782
You didn't remember what had happened
to your father that day,

353
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,618
or Minhu's existence.

354
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,038
I was glad

355
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,248
that you had forgotten.

356
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,462
But...

357
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,636
Yesool.

358
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,097
Let's...

359
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,225
go to the United States.

360
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,231
Remember your uncle's house?

361
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,193
Let's go there and forget about all this.

362
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,236
Mom.

363
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,572
I've...

364
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,867
known all along.

365
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,289
(machine beeping)

366
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,126
(line beeps)

367
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,010
I...

368
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,681
I knew that this would happen.

369
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,893
(somber music)

370
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,190
I didn't know that I did,

371
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,194
but I think I knew.

372
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:37,281
(sobbing)

373
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,705
Don't cry, Yesool.

374
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,124
It's okay.

375
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,917
It's all going to be okay.

376
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,169
SARA: I didn't know
what you meant at first.

377
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,379
Don't cry.

378
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,964
Later,

379
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,092
I figured you might have
gained that ability

380
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,844
because of what happened back then.

381
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,389
After that,

382
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,642
I couldn't bear
to stay in Korea any longer,

383
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,061
so I went to the United States.

384
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,982
You still should have told me.

385
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,903
I didn't know about any of this.

386
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:22,826
(sobbing)

387
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,077
I'm sorry.

388
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:30,000
But I did it for you.

389
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,921
I thought it was all over.

390
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,424
I didn't think he would do this.

391
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,679
NURSE: Is Cha Minhu's guardian here?

392
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:51,438
We stopped the internal bleeding,
but he had already lost a lot of blood.

393
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,483
There seems to have been an issue
with the blood flow to the brain.

394
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,402
Because of that,
his vitals are still unstable.

395
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,155
He might regain consciousness,

396
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,075
but you may need to prepare yourself.

397
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,828
Yesool.

398
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,333
(somber music)

399
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,838
(sobbing)

400
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,183
Minhu, I'll be right back.

401
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,353
I promise that I'll find you.

402
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,106
So wait for me until then.

403
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:35,857
Okay?

404
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,408
Did it ever occur to you that maybe
you're the one who can't remember

405
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,492
pretty much everything?

406
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,496
Bye.

407
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:55,711
I bet Mr. Cha was so mad at me.

408
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,716
How could I have forgotten everything?

409
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,677
Who painted that?

410
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,971
Did you paint it yourself?

411
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,139
Oh, that?

412
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,516
I was interrupted in the middle of it.

413
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:11,226
By whom?

414
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,978
My first love.

415
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,442
You even gave me so many hints.

416
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,699
I still...

417
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,286
have so many things to say to you.

418
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,247
Come on. Wake up.

419
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,960
Say something like, "Did you just
figure it out, you stupid idiot?"

420
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,211
(sniffles)

421
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,381
You can sound super arrogant if you want.
(sobbing)

422
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,675
Come on.

423
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,012
(somber music)

424
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,685
EUNCHONG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

425
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,188
EOMJI: Oh.

426
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,318
Damn it, where's Minhee?

427
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,988
How come I still haven't gotten a response
for the Mopix advertisement draft?

428
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,323
You sent it already?

429
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,991
How many edits have we made so far?

430
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,868
Three? Four?

431
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,745
(sobbing)

432
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,371
I don't know.

433
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,208
They want us to make the logo smaller,
then make it bigger again,

434
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,793
then change the background to a sunset.

435
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,127
(fake sobbing)

436
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,879
I gave up counting at that point.

437
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,340
This one is the sixth edit.
I've been keeping count.

438
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,594
But this is supposed to be the last one,
so I'll go and tell Mr. Cha...

439
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,308
(all sigh)

440
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,643
Wait.

441
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,062
Hong Yesool's here today, right?

442
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,313
Where is she?

443
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,606
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

444
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,024
Get out.

445
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,859
I'm busy.

446
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,820
Please make sure it's processed.

447
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,785
So, you're going to quit your job
so you can take care of Cha Minhu?

448
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,455
If you quit, then who's going to
wrap up our Mopix project?

449
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,667
Isn't Planning Team 1 in charge of
the new Keple phone too?

450
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,003
(sighs deeply)

451
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,841
One month.

452
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,468
I'll cover your projects for one month.
Take a break and come back.

453
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:09,803
No, ma'am.

454
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,764
I would like to resign.

455
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,099
Why?

456
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,268
You don't think Minhu's going to
wake up in a month?

457
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:17,853
Ms. Jo.

458
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,730
You know how hard Cha Minhu
worked on Keple, right?

459
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,733
He's been waiting to bid on it
for so long.

460
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,194
Do you really think
he'll miss that opportunity?

461
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,699
Mr. Cha will wake up in a month for sure.

462
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,578
So, go take a break for a month.

463
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,122
I'll put it down as a leave of absence.

464
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,550
You're not getting paid, though.

465
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,431
(sighs deeply)

466
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,187
JIYOUNG: Minhu.

467
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,693
Don't do this.
(sobbing)

468
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,947
Minhu.

469
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,241
Why aren't you waking up?

470
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,993
Geez, stop it.

471
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,370
He'll get up soon, so stop crying.

472
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,207
When? It's been two weeks already!

473
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,959
So when exactly is he waking up?

474
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,087
Why aren't you saying anything?
Aren't you two supposed to be doctors?

475
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,173
(Jiyoung sobs)

476
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,635
Yes, you're right. I'm a crappy doctor.

477
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,803
I should have gone
to general surgery instead.

478
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,473
Both of you, be quiet.
You're probably bothering Minhu.

479
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,143
Minhu.

480
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,522
-Aren't you supposed to be somewhere else?
-That's not important right now!

481
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,650
Minhu.

482
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,818
(Jiyoung sobbing)

483
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,570
Where's your manager?

484
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:51,780
Get up.

485
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,156
Let's go, come on.

486
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,741
Come on, let's go! Get up, quick.

487
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,743
Hey, get up. Come on. Let's go.

488
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,624
-JIYOUNG: What's going to happen to Minhu?
-I said, he'll wake up soon.

489
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,669
-Hey. Breathe.
-(Jiyoung sobbing)

490
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,545
Come on. We're leaving.

491
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,674
This isn't what it looks like. We're fine.

492
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,592
Come on.

493
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,721
Is Doctor Oh going to skip his meal again?

494
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:17,931
Yes.

495
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,766
He's not been eating for days.

496
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,352
I'm scared that he'll pass out
or something.

497
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,687
No kidding.

498
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,981
He never skipped meals before.

499
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,693
Should we give him a glucose injection
while he's sleeping?

500
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,569
If he actually passes out,

501
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,655
wouldn't that mean more work for us?

502
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,532
How can you say something like that?

503
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,908
Just eat your food.

504
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,411
(sighs deeply)

505
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,958
(somber music)

506
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,052
(knocking)

507
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,188
-What are you doing?
-Huh?

508
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,566
Didn't you see my text?
I was waiting for 20 minutes.

509
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,775
A PK like me has to eat,

510
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,278
go to the bathroom,
and brush our teeth in 20 minutes.

511
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,114
You said you'd always come running
if I needed you.

512
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,200
From now on, I won't wait
for more than five minutes.

513
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:27,042
And I don't like men who are too skinny.

514
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,462
So don't lose any more weight.
You're making me worry.

515
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,756
(playful music)

516
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,470
Howoo.

517
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,944
(light music)

518
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:02,160
I've always wanted to meet with you.

519
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:07,415
I've heard so much about you from Minhu,
so you already seem pretty familiar.

520
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,877
I've heard a lot about you too, sir.

521
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,548
Minhu has been worried
about you for a long time.

522
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,927
He's always thinking about

523
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,347
how to make you feel more comfortable.

524
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,728
Ms. Hong. I may be a doctor,

525
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:32,482
but I think that are
some things in this world

526
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,275
that medicine can't explain.

527
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:36,903
What do you...

528
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,990
Maybe, the reason that the two of you
got your abilities is because

529
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,451
you were trying to protect each other.

530
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,787
At least, that's what I think.

531
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,081
He's going to

532
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,250
wake up soon.

533
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,419
He's done his duty,

534
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,587
so he'll wake up soon,

535
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,257
like nothing happened.

536
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,385
I hope so too.

537
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,014
(dramatic music)

538
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,274
(cell phone vibrates)

539
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:17,736
Yes?

540
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,155
Are you Mr. Cha Minhu's legal guardian?

541
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,948
Right now, he is...

542
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,872
(uplifting music)

543
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,556
(pants)

544
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,810
(uplifting music continues)

545
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,116
I thought you might never
wake up, Mr. Cha.

546
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,786
If you didn't wake up today,

547
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,079
I was going to be really mad at you.

548
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,583
Thank God.

549
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,918
Thank you

550
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,961
so much.

551
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,636
Who are you?

552
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,721
(music fades)

553
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:27,806
What?

554
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,184
Do you know me?

555
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,521
(tense music)

556
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:35,772
What?

557
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,657
Stop messing around. It's not funny.

558
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,700
Are you trying to get revenge?

559
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,995
You're teasing me
because I didn't remember you, right?

560
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:53,832
Do you really know me?

561
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,501
I'm Hong Yesool.

562
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:00,296
We were lovers
who cared deeply about each other.

563
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:04,801
You really, really liked me, so you took
a blade for me, then fell unconscious.

564
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,637
I think that might have
messed with your memories.

565
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,055
I did?

566
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:15,353
So I saw a future in which we were
sleeping together, so we slept...

567
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,729
You can see the future?

568
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,606
No way. That's impossible.

569
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,442
Well, you also had super senses.

570
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,736
No way.

571
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,614
We've known each other
since we were little kids.

572
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,326
We always walked around holding hands,
and we painted together at my house.

573
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,996
We took pictures all the time with my dad.

574
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,748
You followed me around all the time...

575
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:40,295
Hey! You're the one who followed me around
because you liked me so much.

576
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,213
Do you remember now?

577
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,592
I was wondering when you would get
your memories back.

578
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,636
-Are you crazy? You're insane!
-(Minhu grunting)

579
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,388
Did you think that was funny?

580
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,516
-Do you know how scared I was?
-I'm injured!

581
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,810
I took a blade for you, remember?

582
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,562
Oh, no.

583
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,273
Does it hurt a lot?

584
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:04,694
(chuckles)

585
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,616
What? What's wrong?

586
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,284
Did you see some awful future again?

587
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:12,994
No.

588
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,330
I didn't see it.

589
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,539
Didn't see what?

590
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,298
I can't see anything.

591
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:26,925
Really?

592
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,094
Wait a minute.

593
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,221
My symptoms are gone too.

594
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,981
I'm so confused right now.

595
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,775
You can stop now.

596
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,693
I think it's really gone.

597
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,447
Look, I kissed you,
but you're totally fine.

598
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,324
I guess Professor Oh was right.

599
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,534
Professor Oh? Did you meet him?

600
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,495
What did he say?

601
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,290
He said we got our abilities
so we could protect each other.

602
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,250
Wait, so,

603
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,211
it just disappeared after that?

604
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,837
Don't you think it's a good thing?

605
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,548
You said you wanted to live a normal life.

606
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:10,969
Now you can have a normal love life too.

607
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:15,264
I mean, how can it just
disappear so suddenly...

608
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,934
I guess you don't need it anymore.

609
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:24,399
More importantly...

610
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,402
My gosh, who are you?
Why are you taking off my clothes?

611
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,696
Do you know me? I don't know you.

612
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,864
Hey, thanks to that,
you didn't start crying.

613
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,616
Do you know how much it hurt me

614
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,120
to listen to you cry yourself to sleep
every day when I was unconscious?

615
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,373
You heard all that?

616
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,458
I'm saying that you probably did that.

617
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,918
Because you like me so much.

618
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,129
So you must have cried a lot.

619
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,755
Whatever.

620
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,466
And I bet you prayed
every night too, like this.

621
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,303
"Please, God, if he wakes up,
I'll do anything!"

622
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:57,807
Oh!

623
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,434
It doesn't hurt?

624
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,893
It hurts.

625
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,311
Are you crazy?

626
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,604
(both grunt)

627
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,898
Don't be a baby.

628
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,026
Are you a pervert or something?

629
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,736
Why would you unbutton my shirt like that?

630
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,488
I need to keep it shut tight.

631
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,157
Come on, Yesool.

632
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,118
-Hey!
-Yesool.

633
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,704
Yesool.

634
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,914
-Come on!
-(Yesool yells)

635
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:22,623
Take off your socks.

636
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,419
Is that where the logo is supposed to be?

637
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,629
Isn't it supposed to be
on the right, not the left?

638
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,424
In the first draft, it was morning,

639
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,051
but now the sun's setting.

640
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,804
Still, it's not bad.

641
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,681
Yes.

642
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,059
(sighs)
I guess Planning Team 1

643
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,686
doesn't really need us anymore.

644
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,149
Well, they have a great team leader.

645
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,109
I'm the one who made them so good.

646
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,325
Mr. Cha, you remember everything
about my father, right?

647
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:58,993
Yes.

648
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,455
He's the reason I started working at Zeu.

649
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:06,292
Wow, and you didn't tell me?

650
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,419
What a weirdo.

651
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:11,422
Hey. Do you know how hard
it's been for me?

652
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,674
I was always wondering
when you would remember me,

653
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,968
and I wanted to tell you
everything so many times.

654
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:19,013
But I found out
why you didn't remember me,

655
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,306
so I couldn't tell you.

656
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,059
You still should've told me.

657
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:27,980
Don't you know why I couldn't tell you,
even though I really wanted to?

658
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,025
That.

659
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:33,778
I couldn't believe it.

660
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,699
I found you again just to see you
dating another guy.

661
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,494
On top of that, you really didn't
want to break up with him.

662
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,787
I was trying to be nice...

663
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,498
Whatever.

664
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,291
Just look at this.

665
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,586
You brought your boyfriend to a place
that was special for you and your ex.

666
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:51,712
What's this?

667
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,259
"Hong Yesool"?

668
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,311
PILYO: Hong Yesool,
I'm leaving you this letter

669
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,730
because I think you'll visit this place
at least once

670
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,816
before it's taken down.

671
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,946
Even when I was far away from you,
I always wondered

672
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,948
if you were doing well,

673
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,950
if you had stopped crying,

674
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,828
if you were living a good life,

675
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,621
and if you were loving someone

676
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,373
and being loved.

677
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,625
So, I'm thankful

678
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,796
that I got to see you smile before I left.

679
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,717
People say you need to throw away
everything from a relationship

680
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,010
after you break up,

681
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,845
but I disagree.

682
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:45,016
I can't throw away the years
and memories that I shared with you,

683
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,768
and the words we said to each other,

684
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,812
and the feelings that we shared.

685
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,856
I'm going to hold on to

686
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,691
the love

687
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,693
that we shared

688
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,613
in the past.

689
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:02,658
The me of the past will always remember

690
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,745
the you of the past.

691
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,956
So, Hong Yesool,

692
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:11,417
be happy.

693
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,672
PS You didn't keep the promise
that you would meet with me three times,

694
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,593
but I'll forgive you,
since I'm so understanding and a genius.

695
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:25,848
MINHU: Don't cry.

696
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:30,102
If you cry right now,
I'm going to be furious.

697
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,563
I mean, look,

698
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,982
he's just so good at writing.

699
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,567
Here, read it.

700
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,694
Why would I read it? What a weirdo.

701
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,279
You're insane!

702
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,782
Hey, wait for me!

703
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:49,789
I love you.

704
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:56,462
I really, really like you,
and I missed you so much.

705
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,382
I'm glad that I got stabbed.

706
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:06,305
I'm going to stay right next to you
and just love you forever.

707
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,687
YESOOL: You might not believe me,
but I had a superpower.

708
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,317
I could see somebody's future
if my lips touched their body.

709
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,990
Let's always stay together, okay?

710
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,827
Do you want to get married, then?

711
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,996
-No.
-What?

712
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,832
Didn't you just say
that you want to stay together forever?

713
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,752
I meant, let's never break up,

714
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,213
date for just a bit longer,

715
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:41,257
and do whatever we want to do.

716
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,300
Like what?

717
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,926
Like...

718
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,306
This.

719
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,350
YESOOL: I got this ability 23 years ago.

720
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:56,605
It's an ability that disappeared
as soon as I figured out why I got it.

721
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:01,610
Now, I can't see the future anymore,
but one thing is for sure.

722
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,780
He'll be with me.

723
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,702
He'll be my lover forever.

724
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,370
-MINHU: Don't let go.
-YESOOL: Okay!

725
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,205
We're meant to be...

726
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,457
My a**.

727
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,959
Let's break up.

728
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,338
-Are you being serious?
-Yes.

729
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,007
I can't date someone like you anymore.

730
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,468
What did you just say?

731
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,012
How is it my fault
that you lost your phone?

732
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,972
-YESOOL: If we're really meant to be...
-I looked for it

733
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,932
-for three hours...
-...we wouldn't fight like this

734
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,684
-every day.
-...and now you want to break up?

735
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,103
YESOOL: Well, you never found it.

736
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,272
All of my work contacts
and notes are on that phone.

737
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,233
I wish you still had your superpowers.

738
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,694
You looked for three hours,
and you couldn't find a phone?

739
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,780
How on earth am I supposed
to find your phone?

740
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,532
Do you think I'm a dog? Woof, woof, woof!

741
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:54,038
You used to be so put together,
and now you're just crazy.

742
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,375
Then why don't you just see the future
so you don't lose your darn phone?

743
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,001
Just say it.

744
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,629
I know you're not really mad at me
because of the phone.

745
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,423
No. You're acting like this
because I talked with Ms. Yoon

746
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:05,549
from our client company!

747
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:10,096
Oh, so you just "talked" with her
while smiling at her the entire time?

748
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,516
You even secretly texted her last night.

749
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,519
That was for work.

750
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,938
Then why did you do it
at eight in the evening?

751
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:22,691
And why was Ms. Yoon
sending those damn smiley faces

752
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,568
with her texts?

753
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:29,073
I can't believe you said
that we're meant to be.

754
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,659
You're always picking a fight
over the dumbest things.

755
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,953
Hey, I'm sick of it too.

756
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,163
I've never had such a terrible boyfriend!

757
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,289
What?

758
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,126
I hope you're not going to regret
what you just said.

759
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,253
Why would I regret it?

760
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,712
-Geez.
-Damn it.

761
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,340
(quirky music)

762
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,555
I'm sorry.

763
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,848
I'll block Ms. Yoon's number.

764
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,270
I'm sorry too.

765
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,689
Maybe I should get some therapy.

766
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,650
I'm sorry. It was my fault. Let's go home.

767
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,694
-Block her.
-Okay.

768
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:10,698
YESOOL: That's how
our normal relationship started.

769
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,992
(crowd laugh)

770
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,124
I'm going to the bathroom.

771
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,586
(upbeat music)

772
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:34,972
Do you like the movie?

773
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,016
Who are you?

774
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:38,976
Hey!

775
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,270
I'm sorry.

776
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:47,860
YESOOL: Without our abilities,
we turned out to be a lot less dependable.

777
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,195
(scoffs)

778
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,408
You told me to trust you.

779
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:58,370
How was I supposed to know
that our flight would get canceled?

780
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,873
I told you we should
go on vacation next week.

781
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,126
So the weather forecast was wrong.
Why are you taking it out on me?

782
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,879
You were so sure
when you booked our flights,

783
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,173
that I thought you saw
the future or something!

784
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,884
(thunder rumbles)

785
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,302
I'm going home!

786
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,764
-Hey!
-YESOOL: I couldn't see the future...

787
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:17,723
Hey.

788
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,017
...and I had no idea what would
happen in the next minute.

789
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,521
Dating Cha Minhu is so hard.

790
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:28,567
Whenever I meet with him, I'm so tired
that I can't even take a shower or eat.

791
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:32,947
It's annoying, right?
So let's just live together.

792
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:38,702
Dating you like this is hard for me too.

793
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,120
So let's live together.

794
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,124
Wow.

795
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,085
I don't even know where to start.

796
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,546
Maybe at "It's annoying."

797
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,924
Or maybe "Dating you like this is hard
for me too, so let's live together"?

798
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,470
"Annoying" and "let's live together."
Why are those two together?

799
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,847
Do you date me just so
you can argue with me?

800
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:00,307
Then let's just break up!

801
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,101
Hey! I've told you before.

802
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,686
If you say that again, then I--

803
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:04,979
Let's really break up!

804
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,315
It was just one of our many fights,

805
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,025
but we ended up...

806
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,361
-Let's break up!
-Fine!

807
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,862
-...breaking up.
-(door slams close)

808
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,948
(classical music playing)

809
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,021
(classical music continues playing)

810
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,580
ONE YEAR LATER

811
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:08,167
I wonder where
you got the inspiration for this.

812
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,462
The two of them are dating at work,
and they get into a fight

813
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,880
while making a mess of the office?

814
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,423
It just seems so familiar.

815
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,593
Don't you think so, Ms. Jang?

816
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,804
You understood my intentions perfectly.

817
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,765
What are office supplies?

818
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,434
They're objects that we use every day.

819
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,852
Then, of course,

820
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:31,440
we need to make it relatable for people

821
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,776
by using something
that everybody can relate to.

822
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,863
The relationship and the object
might have shattered,

823
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:41,950
but Chesker is still going strong!

824
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:45,037
I think that...

825
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:50,334
you should be able to
relate to it the most, Ms. Hong.

826
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:54,213
SANGGOO: So, what Ms. Jang
is talking about is something like

827
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,716
the story behind how
Ms. Hong got promoted to team leader.

828
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,676
Right.

829
00:52:58,759 --> 00:52:59,677
Right?

830
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,594
That's right.

831
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:03,097
Right. And the emphasis on
the durability of the product

832
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,848
is what the client wanted as well.

833
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:05,766
Bingo.

834
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,685
YESOOL: Is this really
what the client wants?

835
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:11,980
Why on earth would you emphasize
the sturdiness of the desk like that?

836
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:13,565
"Daily life"? That's great.

837
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:16,068
But the idea itself

838
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,946
is something that
a college student might come up with!

839
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,032
What?

840
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:23,784
(sighs deeply)

841
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,494
It took Production Team 1

842
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,081
several days to come up with this idea,

843
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,459
and you call it "something that
a college student might come up with"?

844
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,711
That's exactly right.

845
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,674
Just look at this slogan.

846
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,718
What is it for, a sex toy?

847
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,888
A stereotypical position
comes from a stereotypical desk.

848
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:49,351
Make your position
creative and imaginative.

849
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,563
Isn't it so elegant? Everyone, applaud!

850
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,690
(applause)

851
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,360
It's a groundbreaking slogan

852
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:02,239
that'll make employees
actually want to go to work.

853
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,575
-MINHU: You've got to be kidding me.
-EOMJI: What...

854
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,368
Hello, sir.

855
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,247
It looks like our production
and planning teams have

856
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,582
a lot of free time nowadays.

857
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,000
What an interesting presentation.

858
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,087
Mr. Cha, you must have
a lot of free time as well.

859
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:18,922
I didn't think you'd come
to our team meeting.

860
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,467
I thought my very own team
would be making a mess

861
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,469
of their first project, just like this,

862
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:24,928
so I came here to help you out.

863
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:27,723
But this is even worse than I thought.

864
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:30,309
Oh, man.

865
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,644
I actually think it's a really great idea.

866
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:35,814
It's relatable
and reflects the current trend.

867
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:38,275
I don't see anything wrong with it,
so what's the problem?

868
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,235
It's the perfect advertisement for a desk.

869
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,528
Is that so?

870
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,364
Then why does the director want to quit?

871
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,159
-Sir?
-I heard the director wanted a limit

872
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,536
on the number of edits,
but you refused to budge.

873
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,746
Yes, sir.

874
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:54,124
That's how my mentor taught me
to write a contract.

875
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,418
We should be able to
edit the advertisement

876
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:57,794
until it looks presentable.

877
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,505
I also heard you nitpicked nonstop

878
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,256
while the edits were being made.

879
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,508
Of course.

880
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:04,134
That's exactly how

881
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,303
my mentor did it, sir.

882
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,431
Well, the director doesn't want
the job anymore.

883
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,767
Great job, Ms. Hong.

884
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,393
(laughs)

885
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,480
Follow me.

886
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:18,815
This meeting's over.

887
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,363
(exhales deeply)

888
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,662
(quirky music)

889
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,631
Sleeping pills.

890
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,676
Nerve stabilizers.

891
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,636
Anti-depressants.

892
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,180
None of them work.

893
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,641
And who's to blame for that?

894
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:54,560
You.

895
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,105
Sir.

896
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:02,401
I'll stop contacting you in the mornings
for the edits. So...

897
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,402
I

898
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:07,072
don't like getting acupuncture.
Why, you ask?

899
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,449
It's scary.

900
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,869
But when I woke up today,

901
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,540
I couldn't move. Because of whom?

902
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:18,417
You.

903
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:23,171
Sir, let me apologize
on Ms. Hong's behalf.

904
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,924
So, please accept our apology.

905
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,426
You're even worse than her.

906
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,845
How many damn edits
did you ask me to make?

907
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,514
That's because
we wanted a perfect product,

908
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:34,057
that's all.

909
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,518
Forty-two times. Forty-two, damn it.

910
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:38,520
You made me make 42 edits, you jerk!

911
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,147
I'm not even 42 yet.

912
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,150
How could you ask me to make 42 edits?

913
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,362
Get out.

914
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:49,781
Get out. I won't do it. I can't. Get out.

915
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:50,991
Get out!

916
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,746
Sir, please...
(laughs)

917
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,166
I'm not supposed to move around
when I'm doing this.

918
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,626
So get out.

919
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,004
Get out, Mr. 42.

920
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:06,590
Leave!

921
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:11,553
(exhales deeply)

922
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:21,021
We can't do Director Kang Yoonsung.
He's on terrible terms with Mr. Cha. Next.

923
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,482
We can't do Nam Gihoon either

924
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,442
because he and Ms. Hong
got in that huge fight.

925
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:28,111
Next.

926
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:33,867
Not Director Seo Gangseok,
since he hates Mr. Cha.

927
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,202
Next.

928
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:39,539
MINHU: Director Choi Jihye said that
she's going to sue Ms. Hong, didn't she?

929
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:40,707
Next.

930
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,795
Then how about Director Lee, sir?

931
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,381
I heard he's coming back
to Korea, and the client...

932
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,632
-No!
-Geez!

933
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,051
Of course not.
Of course, we can't use him.

934
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,094
Absolutely not!

935
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,470
YESOOL: Why not?

936
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:58,767
In this situation, I'd like to hire him,
no matter what it takes.

937
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,893
And how will you do that?

938
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,645
He's only coming
for three days and nights.

939
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,398
Well, we can just change that to 30 days.

940
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,233
Damn it.

941
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,820
If you're okay with it, Mr. Cha,
I'll try my best to make it work.

942
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:13,407
And you probably know
how I'm going to "try my best," sir.

943
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,158
How?

944
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:16,910
What do you mean?

945
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:20,789
Do you really want me to tell you?

946
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,666
Right here?

947
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,711
Hey, Roma, I need to talk to you
outside for a second.

948
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:26,795
My goodness.

949
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,588
-I have to take a dump.
-Roma,

950
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,966
can you show me the thing from before?

951
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,636
Why so quiet?

952
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,180
Be more descriptive.

953
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:38,598
How will you get him on board?

954
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:40,726
A phone call should be enough.

955
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:41,935
(chuckles)

956
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,603
You still have his number?

957
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,398
No. I memorized it.

958
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:48,024
Damn it.

959
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:50,318
(quirky music)

960
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,447
OH SEUNGTAEK

961
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,698
(cell phone vibrates)

962
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,699
What?

963
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,118
Oh, hi, ma'am.

964
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,494
Yes.

965
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:02,080
Yes. You want me to come have dinner?

966
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,209
This isn't real, right?

967
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,755
It's not what I think it is, is it?

968
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,798
I also hope it's not real.

969
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,677
You guys are so slow. Here.

970
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,680
Ta-da!

971
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:20,307
WEDDING INVITATION

972
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,516
OH SEUNGTAEK, BAN HOWOO

973
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,478
-BOTH: Are you insane?
-You said you were breaking up

974
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,897
-and never seeing each other again.
-You're one to talk.

975
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,024
You always say that, but you never do it.

976
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:30,317
(gasps)

977
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,361
Hey, stop it.
Yesool and Auntie are here too.

978
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:34,654
So? Who cares?

979
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:38,408
When are the two of you
going to make up this time?

980
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,203
Yes. It's taking you
a bit longer this time.

981
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:44,498
I was going to give you the bouquet.
You two will make up before then, right?

982
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,626
No. We broke up for real this time.

983
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,795
Auntie, she's lying.

984
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:52,005
I'll bet 100,000 won
they'll be back together in a week.

985
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,507
Three days for me.

986
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,967
Don't you know how precious time is?

987
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:58,470
Why are you always arguing
and wasting your time?

988
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,263
It's because
they like each other too much.

989
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:03,350
It's obvious that you two
are fighting out of love.

990
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,978
No! We really broke up this time.

991
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,732
-I don't feel like eating.
-Yesool.

992
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,484
HOWOO: Huh?

993
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,986
(quirky music)

994
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,454
(sighs)

995
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,540
It seems like just yesterday
that they were crying

996
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,916
about how they were meant to be

997
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,710
because their abilities manifested
to protect each other or whatever.

998
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:31,795
Right.

999
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,339
I bet you two are fighting
to make up for the 23 years

1000
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,508
that you spent not fighting. Right?

1001
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,094
Minhu, go up to her room
and make her feel better.

1002
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,513
Yes. She likes eating the food
you make, right?

1003
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,098
Come on, take Ms. Hong and go.

1004
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,017
Sure.
(soft chuckle)

1005
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:49,896
(light music)

1006
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,110
No, it's fine.

1007
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,988
-I'm not interested in dating you again.
-Let's go to my place and...

1008
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,115
Why would I go to your place?

1009
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,868
And get your stuff!

1010
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:05,370
Take everything and make sure
you don't leave anything behind!

1011
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,331
Just throw it away!

1012
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,715
HER

1013
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:21,052
MANAGER: Good luck, Jiyoung.

1014
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,102
About that kiss yesterday...

1015
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:31,605
at the chicken feet place.

1016
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:35,525
I know.

1017
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,487
We all make mistakes
when we're drunk. It's fine.

1018
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:45,285
I understand. You're an actress,

1019
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,829
so you can get really emotional too.

1020
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,540
We hadn't seen each other in so long,

1021
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:52,542
and it's the way

1022
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:55,503
that people greet each other
in the United States too.

1023
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:57,088
An American greeting, my a**!

1024
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:02,385
I was born and raised in Korea.

1025
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,433
Why do you keep playing dumb?

1026
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,226
What do you mean?

1027
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,478
You keep giving me

1028
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:13,647
obvious answers to my questions.

1029
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,358
Because you keep asking obvious questions.

1030
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,657
And if I ask you an actual question,
are you going to

1031
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,450
give me an actual answer?

1032
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:27,744
Sure.

1033
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,289
(quirky music)

1034
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,920
(breathes deeply)

1035
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,012
(sighs)

1036
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,227
(clatters)

1037
01:02:56,606 --> 01:03:02,112
HOST: Mr. Lee, you're famous for basing
your works on real people.

1038
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,781
Is your next work
going to reflect that trend as well?

1039
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,909
Yes, I would say so.

1040
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,411
HOST: Oh.

1041
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,997
Could you tell me a bit more about that?

1042
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,290
So...

1043
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:18,003
The character, Cha Minhu,
dies in the first scene.

1044
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,381
I've yet to decide if he's going to die
in a car accident

1045
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,216
or something even more horrible.

1046
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,552
Maybe he'll get murdered
and chopped to pieces,

1047
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,970
or have a heart attack, or drown.

1048
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,555
I don't know yet.

1049
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,516
But he's going to die in the beginning.

1050
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:33,268
In a horrible way.

1051
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:34,811
Has he lost his mind?

1052
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,813
YESOOL: Hey, don't turn it off.

1053
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:41,151
I really want to know
what happens after Cha Minhu dies.

1054
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,905
We need to know what Mr. Lee is like
if we want to recruit him.

1055
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:48,033
Are you really going to recruit him again?

1056
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:50,368
What? Are you jealous?

1057
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:53,580
No way. Watch it all you want.

1058
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:05,717
The relationship between the two of you
gathered a lot of attention as well.

1059
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,803
You two worked together for the first time
for the Mopix advertisement,

1060
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,306
and now you're an actress
in one of his movies.

1061
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,558
What made you decide to do it?

1062
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,269
I wanted to kiss Cha Minhu.

1063
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,479
(scoffs)

1064
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:22,025
(soft chuckle)
Did I surprise you?

1065
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,736
I mean, the movie character.

1066
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,739
Well, I do like that name too.

1067
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:31,701
I found out that in the movie,
I'll get to kiss Cha Minhu,

1068
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:35,663
and you know, do other things too.

1069
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,665
Oh, my God, what is she even saying?

1070
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:40,210
-HOST: The character, Cha Minhu...
-Does she have some kind of complex?

1071
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,003
I think she might have a mental illness.

1072
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:45,507
Honestly, I think she likes me
more than Cha Minhu.

1073
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,050
She's just trying to piss me off.

1074
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,803
-HOST: Produced by JTBS,
-Is that jealousy I hear?

1075
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,889
-HOST: it won award after award overseas.
-No way.

1076
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:56,309
To be jealous,
you need to like that person first.

1077
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,394
Why would I be jealous?
We've already broken up.

1078
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,355
-Whatever.
-Let me ask you the next question.

1079
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,815
Hey, this is mine too.

1080
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:05,568
Wow, you're really good at
finding those, aren't you?

1081
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:08,071
Hey, don't forget this.

1082
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,156
HOST:
The fans were very excited when they heard

1083
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:12,992
that you two
were going to be working together.

1084
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:17,705
I would like to know a bit more
about your first meeting.

1085
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:21,459
What were your first impressions
of each other?

1086
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:24,754
Mr. Lee.

1087
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,049
How do you feel about me?

1088
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,635
Do you like me?

1089
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,929
(quirky music)

1090
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,390
(camera shutter clicks)

1091
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:36,474
(scoffs)

1092
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,434
As an actress.

1093
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,271
(sighs)

1094
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,898
Of course, I do.

1095
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,067
Ms. Oh, you're so professional and--

1096
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,777
How about as a woman?

1097
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,863
(playful music)

1098
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,990
(scoffs)

1099
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,533
(camera shutter clicks)

1100
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,870
Ms. Oh, why would you say that
at an event like this?

1101
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,205
I'm asking you
because we're at this event.

1102
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:02,083
I wanted to ask you this question
in front of a lot of people.

1103
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,086
If I asked you an actual question,

1104
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:07,964
you said you'd give me
an actual response, right?

1105
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:09,591
What do you think of me?

1106
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:16,723
Then what about you?

1107
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,769
-I like you.
-(audience gasping)

1108
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:25,982
I like all of your movies and works.

1109
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:30,153
And I think the person
who made those movies is a good person.

1110
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:36,367
The person I've been spending time with
is a good person too.

1111
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:39,954
I don't know
when I started feeling this way,

1112
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,539
but I...

1113
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,125
like you.

1114
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,920
(audience clamoring)

1115
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:53,176
No way.

1116
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,302
No way.

1117
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:56,387
(audience cheer)

1118
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,560
HOST: I'm sure the entire country just saw
Ms. Oh confessing her feelings.

1119
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,020
Wasn't that romantic?

1120
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:07,982
That was like a scene from a movie,
wasn't it?

1121
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:13,446
Everyone,

1122
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:17,742
please make sure to give the movie, Her,
your love and attention.

1123
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,289
Wow, that's annoying.

1124
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,333
Wait, what do you mean?

1125
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:30,421
The person who said that
he'd love me to the moon and back

1126
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:33,132
just fights with me all the time.

1127
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:34,926
(grunts)

1128
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,806
I'm going to take this too.

1129
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:40,974
(yells)

1130
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,267
Hey, that's mine.

1131
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,852
It's mine! I helped paint it.

1132
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:46,562
Look, my name's on it!

1133
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:48,773
It's not like you remembered it!

1134
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,317
Now I wish
I had never gotten my memories back.

1135
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,860
The Minhu I used to know is gone.

1136
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,654
Well, this is who I am.

1137
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,617
This is your last chance.

1138
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:02,537
If you leave right now,
this is really the end.

1139
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,372
Is there a fake "the end"?

1140
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,082
I could tell you the same thing.

1141
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,875
Don't you dare drunk dial me again.

1142
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,962
You've called me
way more times than I did.

1143
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,047
If you call me again,
I'm going to get a new number!

1144
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:14,882
And don't get drunk and knock on my door!

1145
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:16,342
I could tell you the same thing!

1146
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,511
The security guard at my building
pretends to be asleep

1147
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,971
whenever he sees you coming!

1148
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,474
-Whatever.
-Take it!

1149
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:24,809
YESOOL: Just throw it in the dumpster!

1150
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,394
(door slams)

1151
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,813
(exhales deeply)

1152
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:35,236
(light music)

1153
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:53,755
I'm walking so slowly,
but he's not even going to follow me?

1154
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,885
He said I was his only love.

1155
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,888
MINHU: You really are my only love.

1156
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:03,681
(sighs)

1157
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,643
(pants)

1158
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,232
Before, you would've already
caught up to me.

1159
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:16,527
No, you wouldn't have let me
leave like this in the first place.

1160
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,905
I didn't know you would walk this way.

1161
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:21,908
I ran here from the bus stop
that you usually go to.

1162
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:23,743
I'm so tired.

1163
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,787
You didn't even get that right.

1164
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,206
Before, I never had to tell you
where I was going.

1165
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,166
Well, I'm not the person
that I used to be.

1166
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:34,045
But, look. I still found you.

1167
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:37,924
Even if you want to leave me,
I'll hold on to you.

1168
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:40,802
And I'll find you faster next time.

1169
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:44,722
So, let's call a truce for today.

1170
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,393
Fine. Truce.

1171
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,521
Don't start talking about
destiny or whatever.

1172
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:52,897
Just focus on loving me today.

1173
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,400
You too. Don't tell me
that you'll love me forever

1174
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:56,651
until you die or something.

1175
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,361
Love me right here, right now.

1176
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:00,446
(smirks)

1177
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,368
(sighs deeply)

1178
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:10,331
YESOOL: We might not be
destined for each other.

1179
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,711
We'll just have to keep fighting
and apologizing like this.

1180
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:18,881
Destiny? We'll just write it ourselves
as we go.

1181
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,432
I want to kiss you.

1182
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:30,518
Right here?

1183
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:31,769
Yes.

1184
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,522
(upbeat music)

1185
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:49,787
YESOOL: That's our love story,
without any superpowers.

1186
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,207
(dramatic music)

1187
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,174
(gasps)
No!

1188
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,804
(theme music)

1189
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:00,107
(closing theme music)
