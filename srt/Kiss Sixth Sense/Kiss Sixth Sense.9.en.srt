1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,462
(panting)

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,505
(groans)

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,009
(heartbeats rapidly)

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,557
(foreboding music)

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:18,852
(finger snaps)

6
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,440
("You Make Me" playing)

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,155
(foreboding music)

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,453
MINHU: Hong Yesool!

9
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,125
Damn it.

10
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,384
(Minhu panting)

11
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,933
You didn't pick up your phone!
What are you doing here by yourself?

12
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,727
Why are you worried about me?

13
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,729
I thought we decided to break up.

14
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,398
You're going to keep this up?

15
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,568
(breathes heavily)

16
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,737
Let's go. Let's go and talk.

17
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,447
What are you doing?

18
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,742
(theme music)

19
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,253
EPISODE 09

20
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,671
YESOOL: Mr. Cha, that hurts.

21
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,632
Please slow down.

22
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,551
Let go! I said, let go of me!

23
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,346
(panting)

24
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,848
How did you even know I was there?

25
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,143
Do you have a GPS on me or something?

26
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,103
Are you really going to break up with me?

27
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,316
You wouldn't listen to me,
and you wouldn't even let me explain.

28
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,193
Did you see something about me, by chance?

29
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,112
I didn't see anything.

30
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,073
You're the one who kissed another woman.

31
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,786
(foreboding music)

32
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,793
What's wrong?

33
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,087
YESOOL: Are you sick?

34
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,965
You've got cold sweat...

35
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,468
Are you all right? Should I call for help?

36
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,180
No. I need to take my medicine.

37
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,264
(panting)

38
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,641
Medicine?

39
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,768
(breathes heavily)

40
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,481
(light music)

41
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,996
Do you have a serious illness?

42
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,041
You had a lot of pill bottles
in your room, too.

43
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,211
Do you have an illness
you can't tell me about?

44
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,298
Where does it hurt?

45
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:37,926
I just...

46
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,679
collapse easily.

47
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,139
YESOOL: What?

48
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,642
Is it like anemia? Feeling dizzy?

49
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,477
No.

50
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,356
I just collapse when I kiss someone.

51
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,943
(stammers)
What?

52
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,989
What's that supposed to mean?
You collapse when you kiss someone?

53
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,825
You see the future when you kiss someone.

54
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,162
I'm like that. Just like you.

55
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,666
And...

56
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,794
I'm about to tell you one more thing...

57
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,921
you'll find hard to believe.

58
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,927
YESOOL: I'm a little stunned right now.

59
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,221
Yes, I understand.

60
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,849
But that's how I am.

61
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,560
So, you really feel better

62
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,604
when we're like this?

63
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,606
MINHU: Yes.

64
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,776
If I hear your heartbeat
or hear your chatter,

65
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,985
then I feel even better.

66
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,029
No way.

67
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,866
If you want to hold my hand,
just say that.

68
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,410
Why is he saying such a weird thing
when he's sick?

69
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,330
You can choose not to believe me,
but it's true.

70
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,083
Should I call Oh Seungtaek
and have him confirm?

71
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,254
Dr. Oh knows about it, too?

72
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,633
Well...

73
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:04,137
is there such an illness
where you get sick if you kiss someone?

74
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,099
I mean, we've kissed
so many times thus far.

75
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,060
Then were you sick every time we kissed?

76
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,730
(whimsical music)

77
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,607
(gasps)

78
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,362
(rain pattering)

79
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:22,697
No way.

80
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,116
(Yesool breathes deeply)
Wait.

81
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,994
-Hey...
-Don't...

82
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,497
Don't scream.

83
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,500
That's right.

84
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,628
Mr. Cha did seem a little off then.

85
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,841
(light music)

86
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,095
But he was fine then.

87
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,389
I said I'm okay if you're with me.

88
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,559
We were together that day.

89
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,186
I do find this a bit ridiculous, but...

90
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,567
So is this what you meant
when you said you'll explain everything?

91
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,736
And Ms. Oh Jiyoung knew all of this too?

92
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,699
Jiyoung is the daughter of the doctor
who's treating me.

93
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,119
I've been like this
ever since I was young.

94
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,539
Jiyoung also knows
that my pain is relieved...

95
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,583
when you're with me.

96
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:20,255
YESOOL: That's why Oh Jiyoung
said that to me then.

97
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,676
(sighs)

98
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,097
Then you should've just said so.

99
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,142
Why didn't you tell me
and cause me to misunderstand?

100
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:36,646
I was going to tell you,
but you wouldn't hear me out.

101
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,902
I can't believe Jiyoung kissed you
just to find that out.

102
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,571
Was it...

103
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,240
true?

104
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:53,288
You said you were swayed
by Director Lee earlier.

105
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,582
Is that true?

106
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,501
Well...

107
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,465
it's not that I was swaying.
I just missed my timing to respond to him.

108
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,969
(sighs)
But seriously, what is this?

109
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,138
How come you feel better
when you're with me?

110
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,516
Why do you feel better
when you hold my hand?

111
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,353
Why is it that when we both kiss...

112
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,025
(gentle music)

113
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,027
(sighs)

114
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,847
(gentle music fades)

115
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
(Yesool screams)

116
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,077
MINHU: Hong Yesool!

117
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,037
Damn it.

118
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,626
(light music)

119
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,685
Please look for a black NFC vehicle.
It's a rental from JJ.

120
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,146
The suspect covered up the license plate,

121
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,273
so it's likely that he turned off
the vehicle black box too.

122
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,317
But you never know. Please check and see

123
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,194
if there remains any recordings.

124
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,573
Gosh, the Privacy Act
is difficult to get around...

125
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,491
Besides, you're not even the victim.

126
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,869
I think this case is related
to case number 2022-000832,

127
00:08:55,952 --> 00:09:00,582
that the Seoul Jungdaemun Police Station
is investigating.

128
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,168
Please check and get back to me.

129
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,210
Sure.

130
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,213
(sighs, mutters)

131
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:08,923
(phone beeps)

132
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,260
Mr. Cha.

133
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,183
You really do seem better.

134
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,894
Does it make sense
that you recovered overnight?

135
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,438
You're not messing with me,
are you, Mr. Cha?

136
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,856
MINHU: I'm fine.

137
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,276
Are you all right? You seemed to be having
a nightmare early this morning.

138
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,736
Oh, really?

139
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,446
I had no idea.

140
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,114
That keeps happening lately.

141
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,075
Including what happened last night,

142
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,660
has anything strange
happened to you lately?

143
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,537
Like someone following you
around or something?

144
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,957
Yes, there is.

145
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,169
Really? Who is it? How tall is he?
What does he look like?

146
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,088
You, Mr. Cha.

147
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:49,923
What?

148
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,259
You keep following me around
like you did last night.

149
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,386
You keep following me.

150
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,182
(playful music)

151
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,266
I'm sorry about...

152
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,102
yesterday.

153
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,271
Saying let's break up...

154
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,440
and not picking up your calls.

155
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,234
It's okay if we argue.

156
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,194
Just don't say we're breaking up.

157
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,488
Also, don't dodge my calls like that.

158
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,741
But...

159
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,452
I didn't like...

160
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,455
that you kissed Ms. Oh last night.

161
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,625
I could say the same thing.

162
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,377
I don't like how you
and Director Lee Pilyo

163
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,087
keep getting involved over everything.

164
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,843
Should we make up?

165
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,221
(soft music)

166
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,391
Don't ever say you want to break up.

167
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,725
I'll really get mad.

168
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,396
Well, you usually get angry easily anyway.

169
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,522
Come on.

170
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,191
-You really want to see me get angry?
-No.

171
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,903
(both chuckle softly)

172
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,954
My goodness.

173
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,873
(quirky music)

174
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,793
No one's here, right?

175
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,003
So what if there is?

176
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,337
YESOOL: Are you crazy?

177
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,051
(quirky music)

178
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,306
(gasps)

179
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,434
(light music)

180
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,565
(gasps)

181
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,490
PILYO: We're here to go over
everything for our shoot today.

182
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,576
I didn't know you'd be here too, Ms. Oh.

183
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,955
Mr. Cha, I'm sorry,
but could I join you guys later?

184
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,834
Since I bumped into Ms. Oh,
I can explain why scene 2B was omitted.

185
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,252
Yes, please come this way...

186
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,963
We have a lot to shoot today,
so I have to explain...

187
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,549
-(grunts)
-YESOOL: Gosh! Seriously!

188
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,134
What are we going to do now?

189
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,345
What do you mean? Is there a problem?

190
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,805
Do I know you?

191
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:03,973
What happened to the guy

192
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,475
who wanted to keep his personal life
separate from his work?

193
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,726
What's the problem?

194
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,896
Those two already know we're dating,
and they're outsiders.

195
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,273
Besides, we're not on the clock right now.
What's the issue here?

196
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,275
I mean...
(sighs)

197
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,277
Whatever. I'm leaving.

198
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,577
-(Jiyoung sobbing)
-(somber music)

199
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,956
(sighs deeply)

200
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,375
I think you'll make it to Cannes.

201
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,712
Who said Oh Jiyoung couldn't act?

202
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,381
Who said you're a terrible actor?

203
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,841
You'll do a great job
with your crying scenes today.

204
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,551
(sobbing)

205
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,554
Please don't cry.
Your eyes will get puffy.

206
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,890
We're almost ready to shoot.

207
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,770
Director Lee, your ex is with another man.

208
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,898
Doesn't it bother you?

209
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,819
They were together
because of the meeting this morning.

210
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,320
And I was on my way there.

211
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:00,989
Don't make me laugh.

212
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,699
A meeting?

213
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:07,036
You had only two sandwiches and drinks.

214
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,172
But didn't Minhu
look perfectly fine back there?

215
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,008
Didn't he look cool?

216
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,175
Excuse me?

217
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,844
He looked healthy, too.

218
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,429
So it's true.

219
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,140
It must be true.

220
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,729
Oh, no...
(sobbing)

221
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,525
Gosh, stop crying.
Your makeup won't go on well.

222
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,571
I have to get ready for the shoot.
Be sure to come out on time, okay?

223
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,698
And make sure to eat that, too.

224
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,450
Please.

225
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,826
(sobbing)

226
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:47,994
Please.

227
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,080
(wailing)

228
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,333
(sighs deeply)

229
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,210
(sobbing in distance)

230
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,087
She's driving me crazy.

231
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,132
Let's do a bit more.

232
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,926
-Mr. Cha, put it in the right place.
-Could you look at the placement?

233
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,850
(light music)

234
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,018
(gasps)

235
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,104
(exhales deeply)

236
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,571
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: How's the sound?

237
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,366
Director.

238
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:31,537
We have some background noises
like waves since we're outdoors.

239
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,207
We'll edit it out later.
We'll take that into account.

240
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,460
EOMJI: What a spectacular lovers' quarrel.

241
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,713
Fighting into the night
and sleeping in your boyfriend's room.

242
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,256
Coming back to the room this morning.

243
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,092
It's not like that.

244
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,510
You always say that.

245
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,262
Mr. Cha texted me,
saying you're sleeping in his room.

246
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,014
EOMJI: And you say not to worry?

247
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,307
Be quiet.

248
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,937
Look, you're being shy. You're being shy.
You're really being shy about it.

249
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,731
(light music)

250
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,156
Director Lee, how much longer
do we have to wait for Ms. Oh?

251
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,033
If she takes any longer...

252
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,286
We'll have to get
other actors' scenes first.

253
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,288
-Give me the storyboard.
-Okay.

254
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,333
(sighs)

255
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,711
(car approaching)

256
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:30,805
MANAGER : Hello.

257
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,433
Hello.

258
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,894
(soft music)

259
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,482
-EOMJI: Hi, Ms. Oh.
-HAIRSTYLIST: Hello.

260
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,278
-MANAGER: Hi there.
-STYLIST: Hello.

261
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,529
Over here.

262
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,865
Get a nice close-up shot of me

263
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,783
at this angle.

264
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,785
My left side is especially prettier.

265
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:53,995
(chuckles)

266
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,082
Thanks for the sandwich.

267
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,714
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Let's get ready.

268
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,465
Let's get ready, everyone!

269
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,431
Ms. Oh, you'll see it on the schedule.

270
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:18,186
We're going to shoot
all the way to scene 13 in the AM.

271
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,857
Were you with Minhu all through the night?

272
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,153
He told you everything, didn't he?

273
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,157
And now he's feeling fine
because of you, right?

274
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,284
Yes.

275
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,330
It's hard to believe,
but apparently, it's true.

276
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,040
(sighs)

277
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,917
Gosh, you two.

278
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,294
What's with you guys?

279
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,298
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
All right, please standby.

280
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,091
We'll get the cameras rolling soon.

281
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,388
(bright music)

282
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,697
(in English)
Cut! Cut!

283
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,449
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Cut!

284
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,117
They're way out of the frame.

285
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,078
Why didn't you mark the direction
for the actors here?

286
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,454
My apologies.

287
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,915
Mark it up here.

288
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,208
PILYO (in English): Ready.

289
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,377
-ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Ready!
-PILYO: Action.

290
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,008
Cut, let's do it again.

291
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,802
We're going again!

292
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,887
Let's do it more dynamically.

293
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,685
(finger snapping)

294
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,065
(finger snapping echoing)

295
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,036
(foreboding music)

296
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,058
Okay. Let's set up for the next scene.

297
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,728
Okay. Let's set up
for the next scene, everyone!

298
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,188
Let's take five and start setting up!

299
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,106
Yes, sir!

300
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,899
PILYO: You got all the inserts
for the car interior, right?

301
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,901
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
Let's set up for the next scene!

302
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,028
Yesool.

303
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,658
Did anything happen
after you went back to your room?

304
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,243
No, why?

305
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,124
Nothing. After the shoot,
let's go and ship everything together.

306
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,334
Be sure to pick up my calls.

307
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,045
(mellow music)

308
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,511
(sighs deeply)

309
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,515
(in English)
Ready. Action.

310
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,484
(all grunt)

311
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,487
-STYLIST: Jiyoung!
-HAIRSTYLIST: What happened?

312
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,488
My goodness.

313
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,615
-Jiyoung!
-Are you okay?

314
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,991
-Jiyoung!
-Let me see.

315
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,618
-HAIRSTYLIST: Are you okay?
-EOMJI: Are you all right?

316
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,203
(indistinct chatter)

317
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,996
-MANAGER: Does it hurt there?
-HAIRSTYLIST: My goodness.

318
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,082
It's swollen.

319
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,291
MANAGER: Get a first-aid kit.

320
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,002
What do we do?

321
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,671
I'll spray it. It'll be cold.

322
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,714
JIYOUNG: Hey, not too much.

323
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,592
What do we do about the shoot?

324
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,261
Hey, that's not the problem. She's hurt!

325
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,555
Are you okay, Jiyoung?

326
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,057
MANAGER: I think we need to spray it
down here, too.

327
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,393
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
The previous take isn't too bad.

328
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,144
What should we do, Director Lee?

329
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,021
Everything else is fine,

330
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,691
but we need a couple more
of the knee shots.

331
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:56,112
I don't think that's going to happen.
Ms. Oh can't even walk right now.

332
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,489
I think we should change the storyboard,
so we only film her upper body.

333
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:05,788
Then what if we
use someone else for the knee shots?

334
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,082
Director Lee...

335
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:13,212
while I was in college,
I've worked as a body double part-time.

336
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,675
I also look pretty good from the back.

337
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,177
I'm sorry.
There's a difference in length a bit...

338
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,638
-What length...
-The length of your hair. Your hair.

339
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,265
Right, the hair.

340
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,267
-Here's the dress.
-Okay.

341
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,893
(sighs deeply)

342
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:28,978
My goodness.

343
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,109
Oh.

344
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,446
Director Lee.

345
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,905
PILYO (in English): Ready.

346
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:40,990
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Ready!

347
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,241
PILYO: Action.

348
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,119
(cheerful music)

349
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,291
Okay, let's get a shot from another angle.

350
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,084
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
We're doing another angle!

351
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,303
PILYO (in English): Cut.

352
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,262
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: It's a cut!

353
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,514
PILYO: Let's do it again.

354
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,390
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: We're doing it again!

355
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,894
(waves crashing)

356
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,315
We had a bit of a delay,
but I think the flights for the staff

357
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:00,110
and the boat for the vehicle
and the equipment

358
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,904
will go as planned without any changes.

359
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,781
How much longer
are you going to keep that on?

360
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,954
Well, it's not like I want to keep it on.

361
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,331
They said we might need
to shoot some additional shots.

362
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,417
Change out of it
as soon as you're done standing by.

363
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,460
Pardon?

364
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,046
Everyone's staring at you
because you're too gorgeous!

365
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,927
(ominous music)

366
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,684
What's gotten into him now?

367
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:37,773
PILYO: Follow them with the camera,
then when we pan out, the father...

368
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,941
Wait. Let's take a three-minute
break and resume.

369
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,317
-Sorry?
-Please put away the equipment

370
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,527
for a bit, too.

371
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,362
And move the barricade as well.

372
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,197
All of a sudden? It's the last scene.

373
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,323
Uh...

374
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,742
I think we'll have an emergency situation.

375
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,619
What are you talking about?

376
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,580
I need to fix my makeup.

377
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,540
I'll be back.

378
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,166
HAIRSTYLIST: Hold onto me, Jiyoung.

379
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,335
-Excuse me, please let us pass.
-Passing through.

380
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,628
-Please go inside.
-Oh, okay.

381
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,047
Everything's set up...

382
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,633
Let's take a break.

383
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,385
What the heck?

384
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,053
Wait. Wait a second.

385
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,139
Jeez.

386
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,893
(siren blaring in distance)

387
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,978
What, what is this?

388
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,689
(suspicious music)

389
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,777
(siren blaring continues)

390
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,916
(whooshing)

391
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,633
How did you know about that?

392
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,385
Did you hear that?

393
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,888
Uh, well...
(chuckles awkwardly)

394
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,020
Is Mr. Cha bionic or something?

395
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,732
How did he hear something we'd hear
after three minutes?

396
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,068
I just checked the mic,
and that didn't even catch it.

397
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,403
-I know!
-Those mics catch a fruit fly buzzing.

398
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,529
(Sanggoo laughs)

399
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,074
We're not even shocked anymore.
It's not the first time.

400
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,409
This is how good we are. Right, sir?

401
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:13,619
Gosh.

402
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,456
(gasps)
What if he's listening to us right now?

403
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,917
Jeez, what are you saying?

404
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,087
(quirky music)

405
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,839
We'll get ready for the last scene. Yes.

406
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,257
-Here.
-(applause)

407
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,842
Let's start shooting.

408
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,891
Jiyoung, it's the last scene.

409
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,267
We're doing the last one.

410
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,394
Okay.

411
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,479
Let's go.

412
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,024
(light music)

413
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,537
Congratulations.

414
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,921
(in English)
Cut. Okay!

415
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,464
Good job, everyone.

416
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,841
Good job, everyone!

417
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,175
Thank you!

418
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,218
Thank you!

419
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,511
Thank you.

420
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,013
Thank you.

421
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,223
Shoes, shoes.

422
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,183
HAIRSTYLIST: It hurts, huh?

423
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,977
MANAGER: Your left foot first, slowly.

424
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,103
HAIRSTYLIST: It hurts, huh?

425
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,396
-MINHEE: Thank you.
-SANGGOO: Good work.

426
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,484
(waves crashing in distance)

427
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,825
Great work.

428
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,703
Thank you, Director Lee.

429
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,788
You looked so beautiful today.

430
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,082
I can't believe I left the ring
back in my room.

431
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,251
It would have been perfect
with that dress.

432
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,212
Stop rambling. So you wanted to say?

433
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,049
This morning...

434
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,014
I was totally craving
some seafood noodles this morning.

435
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,183
You know the place we went to
whenever we came to Jeju?

436
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,685
The owners loved us. Remember?

437
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,063
-Do you want to go there later...
-It's not there anymore.

438
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,523
The owner lady went to Seoul
and opened up another noodle house.

439
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,067
When was the last time you were there?

440
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:09,610
(chuckles awkwardly)

441
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,278
Then do you want to go
to that place in Hamduk...

442
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,906
That cafe became an auto repair shop
a long time ago.

443
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,950
Sorry. I can't meet with you today.

444
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,162
I have to return the car,
and I have plans afterward.

445
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,246
And...

446
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,666
I have to look into something as well.

447
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,585
See you in Seoul.

448
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,754
Okay, then.

449
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,381
(dramatic music)

450
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,348
ROMA: Are Mr. Cha and Ms. Hong
going back on a night flight?

451
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,433
SANGKOO: They stayed behind
to return the vehicle.

452
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:44,019
Mopix is really sensitive about that.

453
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,814
Those two are dating, aren't they?

454
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,149
That's why they stayed behind.

455
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,568
Are you crazy?

456
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,529
That jerk, Cha? Yesool?

457
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,366
She's a workaholic! What dating?

458
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:02,287
I saw Ms. Hong and Mr. Cha together
while I took a walk early this morning.

459
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,959
And at the shoot earlier,
they had a special look in their eyes.

460
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,669
(sighs deeply)

461
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,046
Ms. Hong really has everything,
doesn't she?

462
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,676
SANGKOO: Wait a second.

463
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,429
Now that I look around,
Director Lee Pilyo's not here, either.

464
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,140
He said he's stopping by somewhere...

465
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,687
Let's go. Whatever. My gosh.

466
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,732
ONE-WAY

467
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,110
(dramatic music)

468
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,361
(sighs)

469
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,613
Everything's changed here.

470
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,615
When did that place
become a sashimi restaurant?

471
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,950
(scoffs)

472
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,167
(airplane engine rumbles)

473
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,796
(somber music)

474
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,885
MINHU: The covers are slightly loose,
so there's a possibility

475
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,052
of the car being exposed.

476
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,889
Please pay special attention to it.
Please maintain tight security.

477
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,057
-MAN: Yes, sir.
-When will it arrive?

478
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,935
MAN: If the waves are not too turbulent...

479
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,229
(snaps)

480
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,733
(light music)

481
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,068
(tires screech)

482
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,153
(gasps)

483
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,364
(Yesool screams)

484
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,449
MINHU: Hong Yesool!

485
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,285
Damn it.

486
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,955
Yesool, are you okay?

487
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,000
YESOOL: Mr. Cha.

488
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,544
What? What are you...

489
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,630
Hush, it's Ms. Jo.

490
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,756
(Sunhee sighs deeply)

491
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,134
Planning Team 1 upsets me so much.

492
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,722
You didn't pick up your phone.
What are you doing here by yourself?

493
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,933
(light music)

494
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,612
All right.

495
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:05,994
Please take care. Thank you.

496
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,329
MAN: Yes, sir.

497
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,174
YESOOL: I'm leaving first.

498
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,517
DOMESTIC DEPARTURES

499
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,103
(indistinct announcement)

500
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,192
(light music)

501
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,046
(Minhu sighs)

502
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,470
You knew exactly where to find me.

503
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,973
I didn't even tell you where.

504
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,731
This is the opposite direction
from our gate.

505
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,987
This has happened so many times.
How am I supposed to understand this?

506
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,283
Excellent instincts? Great eyesight?

507
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,577
A good sense of direction?

508
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,245
Or...

509
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,042
you're hiding something from me.

510
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:43,008
You believed me when I told you that
I can see the future.

511
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,094
I'll believe you, too.

512
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:47,971
So tell me everything.

513
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:53,977
So you're saying...

514
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,355
you're usually hyper-sensitive?

515
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,692
So when you kiss,
your senses go into overdrive

516
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,237
and causes you so much pain
that it makes you collapse?

517
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,324
I know it's hard to believe.

518
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,409
(indistinct announcement)

519
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:11,703
(sighs)

520
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,040
I believe you.

521
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,085
Now I can believe everything...

522
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,128
that's happened so far.

523
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,593
You heard my conversation
with Director Lee last night, too, right?

524
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,305
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

525
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,766
But I could just hear it from my room.

526
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,310
So why didn't you say anything, then?

527
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,896
You had many opportunities to do so.

528
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,316
When I told you my secret
and even last night...

529
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,070
I'm sure you wouldn't like it if you knew.

530
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:50,575
Someone I like would feel uncomfortable
around me and will try to avoid me.

531
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,748
I know how you feel.

532
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,876
Is that why I was drawn to you?

533
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,044
Because we're both weirdos.

534
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,212
(soft chuckle)

535
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,089
I know, right?

536
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,386
So, how much can you hear?

537
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:14,641
Well, when you asked me out,

538
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,310
you said you didn't know
exactly how you felt.

539
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,187
But I heard it.

540
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,648
The sound of your heart
beating faster for me.

541
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,068
I don't know. It's just that...

542
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:28,280
-(heartbeats rapidly)
-...you're always on my mind,

543
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,199
and I want to confirm my feelings as well.

544
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,076
(heartbeats rapidly)

545
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,455
You could hear that?

546
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,796
That's not fair to me.

547
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,673
You caught me.

548
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,260
But you get to see
the future that I can't see.

549
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,265
You're not hiding anything else
from me, are you?

550
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,309
No more surprises, right?

551
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,857
Let's go. It's almost time
for us to board.

552
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,777
ANNOUNCER: To all passengers,

553
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,946
if you are on flight 713

554
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:15,243
and have completed
your boarding procedures,

555
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,455
please head to the departure waiting room

556
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,374
to go through the departure procedures.

557
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,177
(sighs)

558
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,513
She's here again.

559
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,559
Oh Jiyoung.

560
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:45,106
She doesn't even have
to make an appointment. She goes right in.

561
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,985
Hey, it's because they know each other.

562
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,697
Are those two dating?

563
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,532
No, no, no.

564
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:59,079
Ms. Oh Jiyoung's not exactly
on Dr. Oh's level.

565
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,331
True. They're on a different level.

566
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,875
Hey, can't you hear someone crying?

567
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,379
(Jiyoung sobbing)

568
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:12,133
Hey, stop crying.
You should have been more careful.

569
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,927
Do you want to get an x-ray?

570
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,053
No.

571
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,388
Do you want to see
an orthopedic surgeon, then?

572
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,266
SEUNGTAEK: Okay.

573
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,185
(sighs deeply)

574
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:29,859
Hey, so he's not in pain
if he's with Ms. Hong?

575
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,864
That's so...

576
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,033
And?

577
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,411
So you kissed him
to find out if it's true?

578
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:46,084
Whoa, crazy Oh Jiyoung. In my opinion,
you're nuts. Crazy, Oh Jiyoung.

579
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,544
That's right!

580
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,671
I'm a crazy bitch.

581
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,591
But I had to see it with my own eyes

582
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,761
to believe it, okay?

583
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,847
(sobbing)

584
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,809
Hey, Oh Jiyoung, stop crying.
My head hurts, and it's killing me.

585
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,477
Hey!

586
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,439
That asshole's not the only man
in the world!

587
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,608
Jeez, you've got to give it a rest.
Seriously.

588
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,819
There's only one Cha Minhu.

589
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:18,742
Minhu is the only one who has been
by my side since my childhood.

590
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,744
After my mom died when I was little,

591
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:25,957
he was like my mom, and my older brother.

592
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,294
He just has to become my husband now!

593
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,589
What the heck is this?

594
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:37,218
My plan is ruined.
(sobbing)

595
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:43,642
So why did you come up with
such an unrealistic plan to begin with?

596
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,477
Shit.

597
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,605
All right. Sorry.

598
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,689
Okay.

599
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,775
(somber music)

600
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,946
I'll go ahead and pack.

601
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,658
I'm off to enjoy my first break in a week.

602
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,370
Aren't you going? Let's go.

603
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,831
Then we'll go too...

604
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,671
I can't even get between them now.

605
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,256
There's nothing I can do.

606
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,467
It's driving me crazy.

607
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,886
What the heck does that mean now?

608
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,141
He's not in pain when he's with her.

609
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:27,936
So what can I do?

610
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,772
I hate to see him in pain

611
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,774
even more than if I were to be in pain.

612
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,946
I don't know. This is tough for me too.

613
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,824
This is tough. It's so tough.
I'm dying here. Oh Jiyoung.

614
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,243
What is love?

615
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,495
What's love, huh? What is it?

616
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,914
I want to cry too. I really want to cry...

617
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,626
I'm going crazy. I feel like crying too.

618
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,837
(somber music)

619
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:58,091
You know, you're not
looking too good yourself.

620
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,385
What's wrong?

621
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,933
-Seungtaek.
-Yes.

622
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,356
(quirky music)

623
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,362
Do you want to go eat pasta?

624
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,448
-SEUNGTAEK: Well...
-JIYOUNG: I'll feed you.

625
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,117
You're always dropping your food
like a baby.

626
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,415
Seungtaek. She's looking at you...

627
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,376
-like you're just a piece of stick.
-What?

628
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,797
-She has zero interest in you.
-Really?

629
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,133
Just give up.

630
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,302
(exhales deeply)

631
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,803
(grunts)

632
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:47,766
SEUNGTAEK: Stop it!

633
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,537
Make sure to lock your door,
and call me if anything happens.

634
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,624
They caught the burglar,
so don't worry too much.

635
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,542
Make sure to pick up my calls.

636
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,795
-Okay.
-Go in.

637
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,046
Bye.

638
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,845
(lock rattles)

639
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,392
Did you check the footsteps,
stride and shoe size

640
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,061
left on the road and the window?

641
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,103
(sighs)

642
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:37,857
Look, he confessed.

643
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,737
Can you check if he got on a plane
or drove anywhere yesterday and today?

644
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:45,782
I interrogated him yesterday and today.

645
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,659
How on earth could he have
gotten on a plane?

646
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,912
Besides, he doesn't have his license.
He got caught drunk driving.

647
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,664
All right.

648
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:56,668
Please contact me if anything new happens.

649
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,504
You know, you told me last time

650
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:03,716
not to contact the victim
and call you directly.

651
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,718
Is there a reason for that?

652
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,305
Can I also check
the other suspects' records?

653
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,557
Check...

654
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,517
Just come over here. You should just...

655
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,935
-Just sit here, and...
-No.

656
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,228
Okay, then.

657
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,023
(quirky music)

658
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,735
I came home in a week. What's going on?

659
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,906
It hasn't even been an hour
since I came from the airport.

660
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,326
How am I supposed to choose?

661
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,996
I want to take all of my babies.

662
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,964
This one.

663
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,632
Yesool.

664
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,093
Do you remember this? You drew this.

665
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,052
I did?

666
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,387
You don't remember?

667
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,975
I think I have some pictures
from back then.

668
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,438
I wanted you
to become an artist back then.

669
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,149
I never thought you'd be making
commercials like your father.

670
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,527
Should I hang up one of your pieces
at my exhibition?

671
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:05,862
My goodness.

672
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,989
Let's see.

673
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,997
You weren't kidding about this drawing.

674
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,791
Dad took this picture for me, right?

675
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,295
But then, this hand...

676
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,425
Wait.

677
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:29,719
All of Dad's pictures are gone.

678
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:34,015
That picture from the frame was gone too.

679
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,391
(gasps)

680
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,977
Could it be that burglar
who broke into our house last time?

681
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,020
A burglar?

682
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,230
What are you talking about?

683
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,733
Oh, I mean...

684
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,276
Well...

685
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,987
(suspenseful music)

686
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,081
Auntie, the drinks are all set up.

687
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,667
You guys can start. I'll be right there.

688
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,044
Why?

689
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,671
Is it because of the photo album?

690
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,842
They caught the burglar,
so don't you worry. Okay?

691
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,096
But that burglar is so weird. Right?

692
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,515
Why would he take someone else's pictures?

693
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,642
Is he some kind of a pervert?

694
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,811
Anyway, come on, Auntie.

695
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,273
(door closes)

696
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,193
(dramatic music)

697
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,033
-YESOOL: Cheers!
-HOWOO: Cheers!

698
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,662
(gulping)

699
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,418
This used to be an everyday thing.

700
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,378
How precious is this? Don't you think?

701
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,130
Yes.

702
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:51,259
I'm not up to date with things
since I've been at the hospital lately.

703
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,262
So are you all lovey-dovey with Cha Minhu?

704
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,388
Hey.

705
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,265
You said you're not going to date anyone.

706
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,018
Yet one-night stand with Dr. Seungtaek?

707
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:03,187
It wasn't just one night.
We slept together for one straight week.

708
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,230
What?

709
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,107
Forget it. That's not helping
my case at all.

710
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,817
Tell me about you.

711
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,068
(Yesool sighs deeply)

712
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,111
I just...

713
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,866
wanted to know why I told him
about my secret.

714
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,993
It turns out there was a reason for it.

715
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,538
I don't know if it's right
to get involved with him

716
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,123
just because of that future I saw.

717
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,833
What are you talking about?

718
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,043
It's just that...

719
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,545
we're both kind of weird.

720
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,547
So it's so weird that...

721
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:31,424
you like him that much, huh?

722
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,469
How about Pilyo?

723
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,971
I saw the video,
and he knows all about your secret.

724
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,556
Did you talk to him about that?

725
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,850
When I was dating Pilyo,

726
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,602
I never told him about
what was going on with me.

727
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,397
It felt like he'd leave me
if I told him about myself.

728
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:49,525
He'd be scared of me and avoid me.

729
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,030
I tortured myself, thinking that
we'd end up breaking up like that.

730
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,616
But I guess Mr. Cha felt like that too.

731
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,409
Just like me.

732
00:42:58,493 --> 00:42:59,577
(Yesool sighs)

733
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,870
YESOOL: I don't know.

734
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:01,871
Let's just drink.

735
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,164
Gosh.

736
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,334
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

737
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,090
YESOOL: But why isn't Mom coming?

738
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,345
NEMO THE BLOOD MOON MURDER

739
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,056
THE BLOOD MOON MURDER
A BLOOD MOON PHENOMENON

740
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,978
THE SUSPECT OF THE BLOOD MOON
MURDER FOUND DEAD AFTER SIX MONTHS

741
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,815
THE POLICE HAVE CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY INVESTIGATION

742
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,650
AND PRESUME THAT MR. KIM ATTEMPTED SUICIDE

743
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,902
(suspenseful music)

744
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,709
(lock rattles)

745
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,342
What brings you here so early...

746
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,680
Get in.

747
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,642
What's the occasion? Out of the blue?

748
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,186
Does it have to be a special occasion
for me to drive my girlfriend to work?

749
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,523
Get in if you don't want to be late.

750
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:13,943
Okay.

751
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,864
(gentle music)

752
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,721
Over there.
Can you drop me off over there?

753
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,482
I mean, it's not like our agency
forbids employees from dating in-house.

754
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:55,401
What's all the fuss about?
I said I don't care.

755
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,153
I care.

756
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,238
After all that uproar
with Director Lee Pilyo,

757
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,574
what if there's a rumor about you and me?

758
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:04,410
It won't be a rumor. It's true.
I am your boyfriend.

759
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:08,456
I mean, people are already saying that
I got to where I am with your backing.

760
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,334
I don't want people gossiping about me.

761
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,920
(gasps)

762
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,255
(quirky music)

763
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,757
Jeez.

764
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,012
(whooshing)

765
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,234
They didn't see me, right?

766
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:41,072
How could you miss them
when you have such sharp senses?

767
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,366
What? Should I have told you
to hide, then?

768
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,701
Do you want to hide the fact
that we're dating that badly?

769
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,412
Well, right now, it's...

770
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:53,042
Anyway, don't make it obvious
that we're dating when we're at work.

771
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,753
Act like your usual self.
Just be totally rude.

772
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,047
Act like a psychopath,
just like now. Okay?

773
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,966
Don't you make it obvious!

774
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,387
PLANS FOR IMPLEMENTING SCHEDULES

775
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,848
You must've planted
a lot of trees on Arbor Day.

776
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:12,979
Just how many trees were
cut down to produce this garbage?

777
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:19,360
How many pages is this?
What a waste of paper.

778
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,695
(yells)

779
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,951
Ms. Hong.

780
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,494
Is your vision okay these days?

781
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:29,620
Excuse me?

782
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,289
Is this the post-production budget sheet?

783
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:33,332
I think you put an extra zero in here.

784
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,377
Get your head back in the game.
Take the extra zero out and bring it back.

785
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,421
I almost said to take out two zeroes.

786
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,802
All right, understood.

787
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,762
(paper rustles)

788
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:48,222
Undecided on the follow-up process.

789
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,058
Undecided on sharing the rough cut.

790
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,185
Undecided, undecided, undecided.

791
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,774
Should we say our paydays
are undecided too?

792
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,694
I guess I've been smiling
too much lately, huh?

793
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,575
Let's all work late tonight. Dismissed.

794
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:15,333
SANGGOO:
He seems a little scary, but not really.

795
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,918
What's with him? What's gotten into him?

796
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,558
Stop web surfing and turn that off.

797
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:35,603
And do something about
clicking your mouse so regularly

798
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,812
while playing the card game.

799
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,776
Stop messaging each other
and let's work, okay?

800
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,821
Why don't we resolve
the follow-up process first?

801
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:47,114
-Okay.
-Okay.

802
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:50,951
So what are you trying to play at today?
You two are at it...

803
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,286
Don't say anything.

804
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:53,913
Just text me.

805
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,122
(grunts)

806
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,374
You poked my nose.

807
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,342
HOWOO: Pilyo did another interview.

808
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,636
I think it's about you again.

809
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,056
He's really in love.

810
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,726
I feel so bad for him,
going on like that by himself.

811
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:17,645
Meet with him and talk it out, Yesool.

812
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,279
If the woman had told him
everything she had been hiding,

813
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,782
do you think the movie
would've had a happy ending?

814
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:33,661
I think the movie
had a happy ending, actually.

815
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:37,081
And I think the woman is in the process
of going after her happiness.

816
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,041
Do you mean that...

817
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,335
the man and the woman
reunite after the ending?

818
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,088
PILYO: I really don't know about that.

819
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,507
But one thing for sure is...

820
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:50,469
that the two will make
the best choice for themselves.

821
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:55,391
The choice that would make them happy.

822
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,977
(light music)

823
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,206
What are you thinking so deeply about?

824
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,251
Aren't you going home?

825
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:23,752
Let's go.

826
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,589
Mr. Cha.

827
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,258
Let's take a walk.

828
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,178
Sure.

829
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,680
(light music)

830
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,607
We've been walking for an hour.

831
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,817
Say what you want to say.

832
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,570
Or should I say it first?

833
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,329
I have no intention
of getting dragged around...

834
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,539
by the future you saw and you will see.

835
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,126
Even if our future is not a happy one,

836
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:07,046
I have no intention
of breaking up with you.

837
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,925
Why are you bringing that up
all of a sudden?

838
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:14,261
I don't know.
I just felt like I should say it

839
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,013
seeing how you are right now.

840
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,435
Do whatever you want in this relationship.

841
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,730
I'm going to do the same.

842
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,609
The first thing I want to do is...

843
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,863
dropping you off at home.

844
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,950
(light music)

845
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,001
I'm home.

846
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,712
SARA: Yesool, you got a package.
I put it in your room.

847
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:49,838
Okay.

848
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,817
HONG YESOOL

849
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,864
HAROO

850
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,950
(light music)

851
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,957
PILYO: I thought it was about time
you watch it.

852
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,959
This is our story...

853
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,545
that I've been wanting to tell you.

854
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,181
POST-EVENT AGREEMENT (EDITED)

855
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,478
The brain CT scan looks good...

856
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,274
and MRI and MRA scans are both fine, too.

857
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:55,946
The frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes
and both occipital lobes are fine too.

858
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,407
Your senses are functioning as usual.

859
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,162
By "usual," I mean by your standards.

860
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,456
I know, Doctor.

861
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,999
Looks like you're doing well.

862
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,502
Is it the power of being in love?
(laughs)

863
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,297
So, how did Ms. Hong react?

864
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,924
She wasn't shocked
when she found out about you?

865
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:19,762
I shouldn't have been so worried.
She was so understanding.

866
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:21,930
That's great.

867
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,933
But I'm worried, Doctor.

868
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,102
Now that she knows
about my heightened senses,

869
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:28,771
and the potential risks that follow,

870
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,522
would it be okay to tell her more?

871
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:34,652
What if I bring back bad memories for her?

872
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:39,281
Are you afraid that she'll remember
that she knew you as a child

873
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:42,117
and ultimately remember that incident?

874
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,577
Yes.

875
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,413
As you mentioned before,

876
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,958
if she chose to forget the incident
for some reason,

877
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,836
then maybe it's wrong
to keep revealing myself

878
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,047
and provoking her.

879
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,674
Just face it head-on.

880
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:59,009
So that you can move on to the next.

881
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,512
Aside from all that,

882
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:05,516
I wish you'd become freer.

883
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:12,106
HAROO
DIRECTOR LEE PILYO

884
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:22,616
I CAN'T HELP BUT CRY WHEN I KISS YOU
HAROO

885
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,702
(soft music)

886
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,880
I want to join this club.

887
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,051
Yes.

888
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,097
Are you Korean?

889
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:47,975
Yes, I am.

890
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,899
A handshake. Don't you know?

891
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,402
PILYO: Let's do a good job.

892
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,320
As a director and staff.

893
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,491
(birds chirping)

894
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,038
WOMAN: What's special about today?

895
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,166
MAN: The day we get to kiss.

896
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,210
(light music)

897
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,144
YESOOL: From the moment I saw that future,

898
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:35,814
I've never been in control
of my relationship with Pilyo.

899
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,695
Because I was afraid of the future,

900
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,405
because I was anxious,

901
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,741
and terrified,

902
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,495
I've never been myself.

903
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,832
So I ran away.

904
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,543
I couldn't handle the future.

905
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,046
All I remember is running away...

906
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:04,009
while ignoring what I had seen.

907
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,763
HAROO

908
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,724
(light music)

909
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,955
Thanks for watching it to the end.

910
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:42,005
There's a question I haven't been able
to answer after we broke up.

911
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,590
The future I saw...

912
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,385
Was it bound to happen?

913
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,720
Or did I make it happen?

914
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,391
I still don't know the answer to that.

915
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,145
What would've happened had I confronted it

916
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,523
and told you everything back then?

917
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:02,359
I was afraid of breaking up with you,

918
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,945
and that you might leave me.

919
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,448
So, rather than enjoying
the present moment,

920
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,826
I was always so anxious.

921
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,746
But even if we were
to go back to that time,

922
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,124
I don't think I could've told you.

923
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:19,334
I'm sorry...

924
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:22,129
for not facing the situation...

925
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,257
and always running away.

926
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,386
But I realized something
after watching this movie.

927
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,808
I don't want to go back to the way I was.

928
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,937
I'm not going to make...

929
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:41,440
the same mistake again.

930
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:46,737
I guess I see the future, too.

931
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,701
I thought you'd say something like that.

932
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,621
The way you look at Cha Minhu...

933
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,626
is the same way you used to look at me.

934
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:02,961
So, now I know.

935
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,217
I should be cool and say, "Fine.

936
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:11,178
I'll let you go for your happiness."

937
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,305
I want to say that, but...

938
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,309
(scoffs)
...you know me, right?

939
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,103
I'm not that cool.

940
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:24,024
So what if...

941
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,985
you see another unhappy future?

942
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,031
If you see a future that you can't handle,

943
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:34,326
what will you do then?

944
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,792
I'll still go for it.

945
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:46,171
I won't avoid the situation and run away.

946
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,257
I'll face it head-on.

947
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,595
(light music)

948
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:11,405
You sure took your time. I know
you've been back in Korea for a while.

949
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:12,906
(soft chuckle)

950
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,660
Wow, nothing's changed here.

951
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,662
Still no customers.

952
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,581
How do you pay your rent?
Are you able to keep up?

953
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,293
Yesool is a regular here.

954
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,088
She has nowhere else to go
if you go out of business.

955
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,298
So, you can't take her away
from Cha Minhu?

956
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,050
You know about that?

957
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,594
(scoffs)
You know everything, don't you?

958
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,430
Well, I don't think Cha Minhu is all that.

959
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,390
Try to win her over, okay?

960
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:40,892
I came back to do everything I can,

961
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,187
but I don't think there is much I can do.

962
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,482
You've done everything you can? Really?

963
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,736
Do more. All the way.

964
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,446
There's nothing you can't do.

965
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:56,742
But I think that will make
Yesool struggle even more, though...

966
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,244
and I really don't want to do that.

967
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:04,124
Gosh, I really came back determined.

968
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,169
But am I too late?

969
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,045
It's never too late.
Life is all about the right timing.

970
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:10,422
You have to wait until the end.

971
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,174
While doing what you can do.

972
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,301
Until she knows how you feel.

973
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,554
Should I call up Yesool?

974
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:18,722
Where is she?

975
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,821
(cell phone vibrates)

976
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,575
YESOOL: Mr. Cha, where are you?

977
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,160
Is something the matter again?

978
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,496
Yes, something is the matter.

979
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,747
What's going on?

980
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,874
I'll tell you when I see you.

981
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,459
What?

982
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,294
Let's meet right now.

983
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:53,507
-Where are you? I'll be right over.
-No.

984
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,675
I'll go to you this time.

985
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,552
To your house.

986
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:58,512
What?

987
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,930
Wait for me.

988
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,224
(upbeat music)

989
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:53,817
What's wrong?

990
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,318
You know...

991
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,948
I don't need this contract anymore.

992
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,246
I cancel everything that's written here.

993
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:08,790
I want to know everything.

994
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:12,252
I'm not going to miss the moment
and tell you everything.

995
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,005
I'll do everything I want to do.

996
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:17,382
With you, Mr. Cha.

997
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,718
And regardless of the future,

998
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,554
I want to sleep with you.

999
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,223
Even if we end up breaking up,

1000
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,851
I'm going to really
pursue this relationship.

1001
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:34,482
Let's be real lovers.

1002
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:37,944
Passionately.

1003
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,617
It's okay if you collapse.

1004
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,411
I'll be spending the night here.

1005
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,042
(romantic music)

1006
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:08,975
POST-EVENT AGREEMENT (EDITED)

1007
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,074
(romantic music continues)

1008
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:03,655
(closing theme music)
