1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,253
Let's break up.

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,589
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,267
Hong Yesool, you seriously...

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,436
(sighs deeply)
You...

5
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,357
Is it because you can't trust me?

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,775
I told you.

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,069
We were bound to break up anyway.

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,239
What do you mean by "bound to"?
What does that mean?

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,616
I saw it.

10
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,285
I can see it.

11
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,873
What do you mean by that?
How would you know that?

12
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,458
I do know.

13
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,044
(dramatic music)

14
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,004
-(door opens)
-(sighs deeply)

15
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,172
(door closes)

16
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,509
(dramatic music continues)

17
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,887
(exhales deeply)

18
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,521
(theme music)

19
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,158
EPISODE 08

20
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,077
(light music)

21
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,470
BASED ON THE WEBNOVEL
KISS SIXTH SENSE BY GOT W

22
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,018
PILYO: Yesool.

23
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,980
Where are you hiding?

24
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,027
Hong Yesool.

25
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,698
What on earth did you see?

26
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,202
Yesool.

27
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,458
Hong Yesool!

28
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,918
Hong Yesool!

29
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,423
Howoo. Yesool is in there, right?

30
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,591
No, she's not. Sorry.

31
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,176
I just need to talk to her for a bit.

32
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,011
I'm really sorry, Pilyo. Sorry.

33
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,096
-Hey, Howoo.
-I'm sorry.

34
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,306
Come on, not you too!

35
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,016
Hey, Ban Howoo!

36
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,185
(pants)

37
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,774
AUTOMATED VOICE: The person
you have reached is not available.

38
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,527
Please leave a message after the tone.

39
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,613
RECENT CALLS

40
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,661
HOWOO: How much did you drink?

41
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,042
Yesool.

42
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,003
Are you really going to
break up with Pilyo like this?

43
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,090
I know you still like him a lot.

44
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,636
Just tell him the truth, okay?

45
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,012
If he finds out why...

46
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,306
How can I tell him I can see the future?

47
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,393
That I keep seeing it?

48
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,062
That every time I look,

49
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,315
I see I'm not a part of his future.

50
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,903
That I saw him marry another woman.

51
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,699
How can I tell him that?

52
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,785
YESOOL: I saw it.

53
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,288
I can see it.

54
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,083
HOWOO: That woman named Eunjung?

55
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,336
You said you saw him marrying her, right?

56
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,048
It's...

57
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,803
It's better that we break up like this.

58
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,892
Come on, let's go inside.

59
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,905
PILYO: I didn't believe it at first.

60
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,283
"I've lost my mind."

61
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,951
"I've seen way too many movies."

62
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,203
That's what I thought.

63
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,165
I wanted to hear it from you directly,

64
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,461
and I went to talk to you so many times,
but you refused to see me.

65
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,049
I felt like I'd die at this rate,

66
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,052
so I made Haroo to try to understand you.

67
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,931
But while I was making it,

68
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,975
I suddenly started believing it.

69
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,563
What "I saw it" meant.

70
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,316
How you would cry after kissing me.

71
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,986
I came to believe it.

72
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,739
You're right.

73
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,825
(dramatic music)

74
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,869
Everything you just said is true.

75
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,706
But what does it matter now?

76
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,209
We went our separate ways.

77
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,421
If you're dating Cha Minhu
because you can see the future...

78
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,923
That's none of your business.

79
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,469
Why did you tell Cha Minhu?

80
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,764
Why did you tell him
the things you couldn't tell me

81
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,808
and even go as far as to write a contract?

82
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,893
(dramatic music)

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,604
You're right.

84
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,400
I wonder about that as well.

85
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,068
Don't you want to find out

86
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,699
why I came back
after being gone for three years?

87
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,332
THE BIRTH OF ZELUS,
BECAUSE IT'S WHERE YOUR FAMILY IS

88
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,639
HONG YESOOL

89
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,267
(line ringing)

90
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,652
Hello.

91
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,675
-Hello.
-Hey.

92
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,602
PILYO: I always knew

93
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,063
that you could see the future.

94
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,982
What "I saw it" meant.

95
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,276
How you would cry after kissing me.

96
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,819
I came to believe it.

97
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,405
(light music)

98
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,242
Did you narrow down the locations?

99
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,244
Yes.

100
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,039
I picked out the locations
based on our draft.

101
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,500
I'll email you
the ones we're able to rent.

102
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,585
Let's go check out the location.
Follow me.

103
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,838
(light music)

104
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,227
If you stand here, you can see
how many Mopix cars are on the streets

105
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,603
at a glance.

106
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,733
At a glance?

107
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,819
I can't see anything.

108
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,489
Ah...
(soft chuckle)

109
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,491
It's just a figure of speech.

110
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,788
Amusement parks, supermarkets, and malls.

111
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,790
I go around checking them out
from time to time.

112
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:23,044
People's tastes in cars differ
based on location, age, and gender.

113
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,255
All of that becomes our data.

114
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,633
Mr. Cha, how do you know places like this?

115
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,636
It's very nice.

116
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,140
It's quiet, and there's no one around.

117
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,519
Did something happen with Director Lee?

118
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,315
(sighs)

119
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:49,362
I think I might need to apologize
for breaking our confidentiality clause.

120
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,492
Director Lee saw our contract.

121
00:08:55,618 --> 00:09:00,248
And it turns out
he knew that I could see the future.

122
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,916
He knew about it?

123
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,713
You must've been shocked.

124
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,217
I would be lying if I said I wasn't.

125
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,554
But now that I know
that he knows everything,

126
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,015
in a way, I feel better.

127
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,435
Did you break up with Lee Pilyo

128
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,146
because of the future you saw?

129
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,317
Well, yes. I guess.

130
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,529
Then, I guess you'll break up with me too
if you see something bad in our future.

131
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,200
(mellow music)

132
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,869
(Minhu sighs)

133
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,079
Don't worry.

134
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,246
You'll never see

135
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,958
a bad future with me.

136
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,669
I won't let that happen.

137
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,298
(light music)

138
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,636
MINHU: Thank you.

139
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,972
Eat.

140
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,394
Okay.

141
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,902
Please eat.

142
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:17,992
Is it good?

143
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,999
Director Lee. Aren't you going to eat?

144
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,669
I heard a new bone broth soup place
opened up nearby.

145
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,254
You guys can go ahead.

146
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,882
Okay, we'll be back.

147
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,884
We'll be back.

148
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,102
Sir, should I bring something
back for you?

149
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,562
No thanks.

150
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,107
Then how about some sushi
from across the street? Okay?

151
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,817
I'm fine.

152
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,444
If you tell me your favorite sandwich
or something...

153
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,280
I said no. Forget it.

154
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,241
How will you ever become a director
when you're so dense?

155
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,742
Gosh, come on.

156
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,704
Why would you mention that again?

157
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,539
-Jeez.
-(sighs deeply)

158
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,332
The edited version is ready.

159
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,001
(cleats throat)

160
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,378
Please take a look at it later.

161
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,006
I'll be back.

162
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,471
(light music)

163
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,599
(sighs deeply)

164
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,436
(soft grunts)

165
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,191
(light music continues)

166
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,988
JIYOUNG: Jiyoung is very sick.

167
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,824
I won't just sit back and watch
if you make my daughter cry.

168
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,077
She says she's free tomorrow, so...

169
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,913
-MINHU: This is Jiyoung, isn't it?
-(gasps)

170
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,581
Oh, my God.

171
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,749
What the...

172
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,250
Is he psychic or something?

173
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,964
My spelling and grammar
were perfect this time.

174
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,216
What gave it away?

175
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,967
Have some tea.

176
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,011
Wait.

177
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,014
Isn't that my phone?

178
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,224
(chuckles)

179
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,728
Come on.

180
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,273
It's because you don't try
hard enough for your daughter.

181
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,193
That's because
I don't want you to get hurt.

182
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,736
That's why I'm not even trying.

183
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,695
Dad.

184
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,865
Does Minhu talk about
the woman he's seeing?

185
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,408
Have you seen her?

186
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,204
I know who she is.

187
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,330
Really?

188
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:29,791
What's she like?

189
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,378
Minhu is picky when it comes to women,
so she must be...

190
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,546
She has a nasty personality
and is terrible at her job.

191
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,632
She always has a sour look on her face.

192
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,758
She must be pretty.

193
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,468
I'm prettier, you know.

194
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,805
By the way,

195
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:48,017
is it true that Minhu feels better
when he's with her?

196
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,521
He said his symptoms disappear
when he's with her.

197
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,815
Is that really true?

198
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,694
I haven't met her yet,
so I can't say for sure,

199
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,155
but if that's the case,
it's a great thing for Minhu.

200
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,033
What do you mean it's a great thing?

201
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,619
Seriously!
(grunting)

202
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,997
(clears throat)

203
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,169
SANGGOO: Thank you.

204
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,384
It is impressive that
it passed the PPM on the first try.

205
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,389
Well, of course, we don't know if it was
his talent or connections at work.

206
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,266
What are you trying to say?

207
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,560
Hey, come on now.

208
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,397
Hey, everybody knows
that the vice president values Cha Minhu.

209
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,441
Just look at the photo leak incident.

210
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,943
If it were any other team,
he would've been switched out.

211
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,280
You're talking apples and oranges.

212
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,532
Mr. Cha is super competent.

213
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,658
Hey!

214
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,493
Competent?

215
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,662
It's all a facade.

216
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,374
To be blunt, they've got the best talent
working on that project.

217
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,793
It'd be problematic
if he couldn't get that kind of result.

218
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,837
This one's predictable too.

219
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,757
In an open desert,

220
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,468
they'll have the car
race real fast, you know.

221
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,428
He'll rotate the car
at all different angles.

222
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,805
One shot from here, and one from here.

223
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,515
Then one more from above.

224
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,975
(scoffs)
Right?

225
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,685
Yeah, you're wrong.

226
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,522
The concept this time is totally awesome.
You got no clue what you're talking about.

227
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:20,109
Don't overdo it. Look at you.
You're overreacting again. My goodness.

228
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,570
Don't be shocked
when you hear about it. This one...

229
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,822
We're going to hit the jackpot.

230
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,868
PILYO: Yes.

231
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,287
I'll check the conditions
after I look at the weather.

232
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,206
I'll get back to you on that.

233
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,124
I'll take care of that myself.

234
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,669
Director Lee will be right out
after his call.

235
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,506
-Let's move to the conference room.
-Okay.

236
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,050
(light music)

237
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,809
Why don't we get going?

238
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,940
Jeju Island?

239
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,110
I looked around lots of places
for the last shot of the wedding,

240
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,320
and this seems like the best place.

241
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,657
SANGGOO: Well, it's a great backdrop,

242
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,618
but would it work with our schedule
to shoot on Jeju Island?

243
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,622
If we shoot in Jeju,
we'll have to send the car there by boat.

244
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,999
I'll need to discuss it with Mopix first.

245
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,418
I asked Mr. Baek about it, just in case,

246
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,922
and he said going there
for our shoot itself isn't an issue.

247
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,716
Jeju is the setting for the movie
we're working on right now,

248
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,094
so we went there last month
to scout out some locations.

249
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,054
Booking a location
shouldn't be tough, either.

250
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,349
It seems like you've got
your heart set on that location.

251
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,478
By chance, do you have
any personal memories there?

252
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,313
No comment.

253
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,649
ROMA: Are we really going to Jeju, then?

254
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,818
That's so exciting! Isn't it?

255
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,030
I'll organize the location list
and email it to you.

256
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,115
All right.

257
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,992
Are we done with the meeting then?

258
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,702
That went a lot quicker than I expected.

259
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,120
-Thank you, everyone.
-Thank you.

260
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,580
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

261
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,583
Oh, right. Ms. Hong.

262
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,170
I'm on my way to meet
with the shooting team. Care to join me?

263
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,547
I heard you're good friends
with Director Lim Huiwoo.

264
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,674
I know Director Lim too.

265
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,842
I could come with...

266
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,636
Don't you have a meeting
with the Production Team?

267
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,139
Right. I'll see you next time, then.

268
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,809
Let's go.

269
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,529
Where are we going? I know you lied
about meeting Director Lim.

270
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,656
There's somewhere I want to go with you.

271
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,912
The future you saw.

272
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,123
Have you ever questioned any of it?

273
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,418
Never.

274
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,962
The future I saw has never been wrong.

275
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,715
Is that right?

276
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,468
What if I told you, you were wrong?

277
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,101
(light music)

278
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,661
I'm sorry,
but it's our break time right now...

279
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,456
(gasps)
Lee Pilyo. You were here yesterday too.

280
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,419
Oh, my. Hong Yesool?

281
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,214
Yesool said she wanted to see you too.

282
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,216
Gosh, Yesool!

283
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,760
It's been a while. How long has it been?

284
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,351
Honey, are they your friends?

285
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,395
Yeah, they're friends from college.

286
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,814
-You two met yesterday, right?
-Yes.

287
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,732
She was in the same major too.

288
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,360
This is my husband.

289
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,239
Say hi. He may look old,
but he's four years younger than me.

290
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,532
Hello.

291
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,414
Yesool. We haven't seen
each other in ages.

292
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,874
It's our first time since I got married.

293
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,627
I didn't even know you got married.

294
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,796
It's been a year.

295
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,008
But the kid's 14 months old.

296
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,093
(soft chuckle)

297
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,429
Actually...

298
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,890
I've been wanting to see you.

299
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,936
I've been wanting to apologize to you
about a lot of things.

300
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,064
Apologize?

301
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:34,238
You know, I used to flirt with Pilyo a lot
because I had a huge crush on him.

302
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,286
Do you want to hear something
really embarrassing?

303
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,749
My husband doesn't even know.

304
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,794
After you guys broke up,
I went to see Pilyo, who was heartbroken,

305
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,338
and confessed how I felt about him.

306
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,635
I even surprised him with a kiss
because I was drunk.

307
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,846
YESOOL: Then, that was...

308
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,893
(light music)

309
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,615
He got so mad at me
and refused to see me afterward.

310
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,368
He wouldn't pick up my calls,
and he pretended like I didn't exist.

311
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,413
So, I got really drunk that day

312
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,500
and met my husband,
married him and had a baby with him.

313
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,836
That's when he started
talking to me again.

314
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,922
What a mean jerk.

315
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,058
So, why did you guys break up?

316
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,061
Oh, well...

317
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,147
He said it was his fault
that you guys broke up.

318
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,151
That it was because
he couldn't gain your trust.

319
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,738
It wasn't because of me, was it?

320
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,708
(baby sobs)

321
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,835
Are you two done talking?

322
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,212
You traitor.

323
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,381
She was whining just a minute ago.

324
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,675
Look at her smile
as soon as she sees her mommy.

325
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,345
This is why I can't leave her
with anyone else.

326
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,639
Anyway, thank you.

327
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,559
My mother-in-law
went to a get-together today.

328
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,436
That's why I'm struggling like this.

329
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,105
Yesool, hold out as long as you can
before you get married.

330
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,816
Come on, pick her up.

331
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,738
-Come here. Come to mommy.
-Oh, my goodness. Did you miss your mommy?

332
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,948
-Say, "Mommy." Mommy.
-Mommy.

333
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,616
-She can say that.
-Can she say Daddy?

334
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,285
Of course! Say, "Daddy," darling.

335
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,286
Daddy.

336
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,163
-Daddy.
-Daddy.

337
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,414
Mommy.

338
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,417
You know nothing's going on

339
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,377
-between Eunjung and me.
-I just don't like it.

340
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,546
I don't want you to see her again.

341
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,340
I'm asking why you're doing this.
Just tell me why.

342
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,925
-Daddy.
-Daddy.

343
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,302
-Mommy.
-Mommy.

344
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,553
(Pilyo laughs)

345
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,181
So adorable.

346
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,686
(dramatic music)

347
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,784
How can you just walk away like that?
Let's talk.

348
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,453
I have nothing to say to you right now.

349
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,663
Let's talk later.

350
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,123
Talk before you go.

351
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,293
We finally get to have this conversation
after three years.

352
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,836
If you run away like this again,

353
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,297
then we can neither say goodbye
nor start over again.

354
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,840
We'll just be stuck like this again.

355
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,384
Fine.

356
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,845
I saw it wrong. Happy now?

357
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,517
I sucked back then.
I was hurting and distraught.

358
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,478
That was all a misunderstanding
on my part.

359
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,604
Happy now?

360
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,440
That's why you should've told me.
You should have...

361
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,358
And if I did?

362
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,652
Could you have handled it?

363
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:04,073
You would've been scared and avoided me.
And eventually, we would've broke up.

364
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,743
Do you know how scary that is?

365
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,080
"What will he see me as?"

366
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,582
"A crazy girl?"

367
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,376
"Some psychic?"

368
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,711
But I only saw unhappy futures.

369
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,339
You were happily married to another woman!

370
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,217
But what you saw was wrong.
That wasn't it.

371
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,014
When you ghosted me
and cut me off like that,

372
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,101
I knew I couldn't persuade you,
no matter what.

373
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,478
So I just waited.

374
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,355
Because I had faith.

375
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:37,857
(sighs)

376
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,819
Is that why you waited until
Eunjung got married and had a baby

377
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:42,736
to come back?

378
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,488
Yes.

379
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,159
Otherwise, you would've continued to
trust the future you saw and push me away.

380
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,453
(Pilyo sighs)

381
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,041
I don't know what you saw exactly

382
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,627
or what I'm like in that future.

383
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,047
But...

384
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,966
both back then and now,

385
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,011
I'm right here in front of you.

386
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,429
This is me...

387
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,598
This is me, right here, right now.

388
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:12,808
Back then,

389
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,894
and even now,

390
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,273
I like you a lot.

391
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,735
I know that for sure.

392
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,114
(somber music)

393
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,660
Sorry.

394
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,788
I don't want to hear
anything from you right now.

395
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,458
Let's talk later.

396
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,002
Are you running away again?

397
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,465
(somber music)

398
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,348
(sighs deeply)

399
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,072
PILYO: Hong Yesool.

400
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,076
Why are you doing this?
You have to tell me so I'll know.

401
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,036
YESOOL: And what if I tell you?

402
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,622
If I tell you, what can you do to fix it?

403
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,083
You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

404
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,250
(sighs deeply)

405
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,509
-Daddy.
-Mommy.

406
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,803
-Boy.
-How adorable.

407
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,972
Mommy and Daddy.

408
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,474
Say, "Daddy," darling. "Daddy."

409
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,729
YESOOL: Do you think we'd be different
if I told you?

410
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,149
We were bound to...

411
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,861
break up anyway.

412
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,910
This is

413
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,955
all my doing.

414
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,834
What do you mean?

415
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,294
Ms. Hong knows Director Lim pretty well.

416
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:07,506
Since Director Lim is so particular,
I think he wanted Ms. Hong to go with him

417
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,383
since they've worked together before.

418
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,345
Ms. Hong probably went straight home
after meeting with the shooting team.

419
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,014
All right, then.

420
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,266
Report back to me with the final estimate

421
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,059
after coordinating
with the Production Team.

422
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,937
All right. I'll call it a day then.

423
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,022
Okay.

424
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,401
(door opens)

425
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,485
(door closes)

CHIEF CHA MINHU

429
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,417
(cell phone vibrates)

430
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,295
I thought you were dating Cha Minhu.
Did you two fight?

431
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,589
You two are always together.

432
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,967
You should bring him here.

433
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,178
Don't get dumped
before you even let me meet him.

434
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,348
I won't get dumped. Never ever.

435
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,725
I haven't slept with him yet.

436
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,645
No. Well, you never know
what's going to happen.

437
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,230
I was wrong about what I saw.

438
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,566
I don't know yet.

439
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,359
What? What are you talking about?

440
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,655
I heard Lee Pilyo is back.
Is that unsettling you?

441
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:19,495
How do you know me so well?

442
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,374
I heard your mom is back too.

443
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,044
Stop drinking, and go home.

444
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,378
Haejin.

445
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,090
What would you do if you were in my shoes?

446
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,217
What do you mean?

447
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,929
Everything was a misunderstanding
on my part.

448
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,807
But that misunderstanding

449
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,642
has been torturing me all this time.

450
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,647
Why do you think I have such a curse?

451
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,275
I wish I could be normal.

452
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,570
Then that would've never happened,

453
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,073
and I wouldn't have messed up
my own life so badly.

454
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,449
What are you talking about?

455
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,035
I mean...

456
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,747
My life will continue to get twisted,

457
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:07,543
and I'll just die
after things keep getting twisted.

458
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,379
How sad is that?

459
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,923
It's not like I asked for this.

460
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,468
I don't know why your life got twisted.

461
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,804
But even that "twisted mess"
is a part of your life.

462
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,306
You just need to undo what got twisted.

463

466
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,063
Start with your boyfriend.

467
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,276
Who cares about him?

468
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,988
I'm going to be successful through my job.

469
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,949
I got reinstated to the Mopix project.

470
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:43,662
The commercial that my dad worked on.
I'm going to succeed and show them.

471
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,623
Ah... Did I tell you?

472
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:51,587
My dad took a lot of pictures of me
when I was little.

473
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,256
And those pictures were in a commercial.

474
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,967
And I get to be in charge
of that commercial.

475
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,220
I'm really, really going to do a good job.

JIYOUNG: Hello?

483
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,541
Ms. Hong?

484
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,420
Isn't this Mr. Cha's phone?

485
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,006
It is. This is Oh Jiyoung.

486
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,093
Minhu stepped out for a minute.

487
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,845
He's having dinner with me.

488
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,388
Didn't he tell you?

489
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,892
I see. Then I'll call back later...

490
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,562
Minhu talked a lot about you, Ms. Hong.

491
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,148
-About me?
-Yes.

492
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,901
He said you have a very special ability.

493
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,654
He said you're different from other women

494
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,821
he's dated before.

495
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,240
He said he's dating you
because that fascinates him.

496
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,328
Ms. Hong, I didn't know
you had such a special ability.

497
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,207
Let me in on your secret.

498
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,708
I want to learn how to do it too.

499
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,877
Ms. Oh.

500
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,381
I don't know what you heard
from Mr. Cha, but...

501
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,092
Anyway, I'll tell Minhu to call you
when he comes back.

502
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,803
See you at the shoot. Bye.

503
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,606
RECENT CALLS
HONG YESOOL

504
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,816
DELETE

505
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,492
Sorry. Work ended late.

506
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,619
Where's Minhu?

507
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,413
He told me earlier
that he was already here.

508
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,665
He's parking his car.

509
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,252
The underground parking lot
is so small here.

510
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,712
Gosh.

511
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,841
He wouldn't be able
to hear me right now, would he?

512
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,219
Even he couldn't hear me
from the underground parking lot, right?

513
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,221
Did you cause trouble again?

514
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,139
Yes.

515
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,016
And I'm thrilled.

516
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,727
(giggles)

517
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,942
Gaeul, how many times do I have to
tell you to put your seat belt on right?

518
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,819
Fine, I will!

519
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,904
-I'll put it on!
-Raon, just go on

520
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,406
and rip those clothes.

521
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,283
I worked hard to buy that.
It was expensive.

522
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,827
-Daddy, na-na-na-boo-boo!
-Honey!

523
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,620
-Na-na-na-boo-boo!
-You said you were working

524
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,122
with Director Lee Pilyo, right?

525
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,040
Yes.

526
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,207
-Aren't you?
-I am.

527
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,625
Oh, my God.

528
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,170
Stop the car.
This is no time to be driving.

529
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,716
Look.

530
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,593
-PILYO: Back then, and even now...
-Awesome, huh?

531
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,844
(Sanggoo's wife gasps)

532
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,889
-(car horn honks)
-Honey, the light changed. Go.

533
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,600
SANGGOO'S WIFE: My goodness.

534
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,643
Come on, drive better.

535
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,520
PILYO: This is me, right here, right now.

536
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,149
Oh, my God.

537
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,734
Back then, and even now,

538
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,863
-Excuse me.
-I like you a lot.

539
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,782
-(gasps)
-I know that for sure.

540
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,453
He must be crazy. Crazy.
That's crazy, that's... I'm sorry.

541
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,748
-I must be crazy.
-I don't want to hear anything from you.

542
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,381
(quirky music)

543
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,179
(pants)

544
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,185
(exhales deeply)

545
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,562
What the heck is going on?

546
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,232
I almost got a heart attack
on my way to work.

547
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,484
-What's with that video?
-I'm going to file a lawsuit.

548
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,945
You said your cousin was a lawyer, right?

549
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,155
I'm going to sue the moron
who posted that video.

550
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,699
Okay, but that aside,

551
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,201
explain yourself first.

552
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,121
Did you decide to
get back together with Lee Pilyo?

553
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,748
It's not like that.

554
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,458
You dumped him. Right?

555
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,293
He was clinging to you.

556
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,962
You've lost it.

557
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,214
Just keep dating him. Why dump him?

558
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,799
I'm dating Cha Minhu.

559
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,969
Yes, so date Cha Minhu
and date Lee Pilyo too.

560
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,846
Just date them all...

561
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,390
-What?
-Keep it to yourself.

562
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,935
So, you're...

563
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,440
So you're dating Cha Minhu,
but also Lee Pilyo...

564
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,528
Two-timing... You were two-timing?

565
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,947
You're awesome.

566
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,241
Eomji, really. It's not like that.

567
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,662
We just had to resolve some issues,
and things just turned out that way.

568
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,585
But you know, that video.

569
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,003
I'm sure Cha Minhu saw it.

570
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,337
What are you going to do?

571
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,006
You know he won't just sit back.

572
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,466
Damn it.

573
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,471
Don't worry.

574
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,515
I bet nobody knows...

575
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,728
I mean, maybe... People might not know.

576
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:04,065
I have a really good eye
for these things, so right away,

577
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,984
I recognized you.
But most people wouldn't know.

578
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,360
In that video,

579
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,821
you looked humongous

580
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:13,200
and really stumpy too.

581
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,662
Only your backside showed.
No one will know.

582
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,040
Not even Cha Minhu.

583
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,084
He wouldn't know. No way.

584
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,419
Do you really think so?

585
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,296
Today, I...

586
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,259
I'm not even going to go
near Planning Team 1.

587
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:32,886
(sighs)

588
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,402
Indeed, working with you keeps things
moving along swiftly.

589
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,821
I've checked everything.
We'll make sure we stay on schedule.

590
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,866
Since we're shooting in Jeju,
please make sure there are no setbacks.

591
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,203
Right. You saw that video
with Director Lee Pilyo, right?

592
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,872
It's good for us,
since he's getting a lot of attention.

593
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,791
Is it true that the woman

594
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,126
is the inspiration
for the main character of Haroo?

595
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,128
Rumor has it
they're getting back together.

596
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,674
(laughs)

597
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,969
PILYO (over video):
I don't know what you saw exactly.

598
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,263
or what I'm like in that future.

599
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,514
But...

600
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,600
both back then and now,

601
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,895
I'm right here in front of you.

602
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,856
This is me. This is...

603
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,277
(dramatic music)

604
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,257
What's with the video?

605
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,134
Oh, well...

606
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,512
It's not what you think.

607
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,308
What I think? What is going on then?

608
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:02,976
Didn't I tell you?

609
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,103
I'm really possessive and jealous.

610
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,274
You two meeting up for work
is unavoidable,

611
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,277
but I don't want you seeing him
for personal reasons outside of work.

612
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,738
We agreed to respect
each other's personal lives,

613
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,949
but don't you think there should be
basic courtesy between lovers?

614
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,910
-What about you, then?
-What?

615
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:24,039
How much did you tell Ms. Oh Jiyoung
about me?

616
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,667
-What are you talking about?
-Haven't you heard?

617
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:31,588
Ms. Oh picked up
when I called you last night.

618
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,840
And she said

619
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,509
you're dating me only
because I have a special ability.

620
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,137
By any chance,

621
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,972
did you tell her about me?

622
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,101
I don't know what Jiyoung told you,

623
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,394
but that's not true.

624
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,104
Why would I tell her that?

625
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,732
Then what ability was she referring to?

626
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,734
How would she know about that?

627
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,570
(sighs)

628
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,572
That's...

629
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,368
Why can't you answer me?

630
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,579
It's a misunderstanding.

631
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,540
-I can't explain it right now...
-A misunderstanding?

632
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,376
Why can't you explain it?

633
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,670
(dramatic music)

634
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,550
I can't talk about this right now.
Let's talk later.

635
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,843
Mr. Cha.

636
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,055
(dramatic music continues)

637
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,056
(door opens)

638
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,933
(door closes)

639
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,897
(sighs deeply)

640
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,402
PILYO: Hello.

641
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,362
Here, have some of this.

642
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,863
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

643
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,415
Here's some bubble tea for you,
your favorite!

644
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,625
With 70% sweetness,
filled halfway with ice.

645
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,919
Extra boba. One layer of milk foam. Right?

646
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,546
Don't I have a great memory?

647
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,799
This is how well I know you, Ms. Yoo.

648
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,261
You doing this
won't make it go away easily.

649
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,389
I know. But you can make it go away.

650
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,434
Because you have really great skills!

651
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,395
Do you know how hard it was
to block the press

652
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,480
when you got into a fight with a reporter?

653
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,606
(scoffs)

654
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,691
I know.

655
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,528
So if you stop this one, I'll sign
a contract with you for another film.

656
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,072
The remaining Q&As, interviews,
and TV appearances.

657
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,575
I'll do everything you schedule.
I'll do everything you say.

658
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,286
I've never asked you
for a favor like this.

659
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,372
I met the person who posted the video
and got them to take it down.

660
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:33,501
The legal team is also taking down all
of the videos that are circulating online.

661
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,171
The reporters will stop
writing about it too.

662
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,590
I knew I could count on you!

663
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,759
Thank you.

664
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,931
(rustles)

665
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,477
(sighs deeply)

666
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,482
Gosh.

667
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:56,566
Hey.

668
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,568
Does that make you feel better?

669
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,861
My goodness.

670
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,781
I heard you handed over everything
when Ms. Hong came back.

671
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,241
It was hers to begin with anyway.

672
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:06,868
(sucks teeth)

673
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,371
It looks like something went on
behind the scenes anyhow.

674
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,539
(tongue clicks)

675
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,629
I think Cha Minhu and the VP made a deal.

676
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,883
-What do you...
-Gosh, you need to catch on quick.

677
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,428
Apparently, Mr. Cha planned everything out

678
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,848
so he could get Ms. Hong reinstated.

679
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,437
That's why you should choose
your allies wisely.

680
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:38,441
Ms. Jo tells me that all you do
is play second fiddle to Hong Yesool.

681
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,069
How much longer will you let her
take your rightful position?

682
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,030
Are you going to take a backseat
at Jeju Island too?

683
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:48,284
I just feel bad for you.
I feel so bad, you know?

684
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,330
I'm just saying this
because I care about you.

685
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,665
-Okay.
-Okay.

686
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,375
Take care, then.

687
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,418
(dramatic music)

688
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,345
Ms. Hong Yesool.

689
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,182
Mom. Give it to me.

690
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,142
I'm still young, you know.

691
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,771
You're off to Jeju Island
as soon as I came to visit you.

692
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,191
We're both so busy
we haven't even gotten a drink.

693
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:21,860
I know.

694
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,532
CHIEF CHA MINHU

695
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,953
What? Is that the guy who's busy
on the third weekend of every month?

696
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,872
Why aren't you answering?

697
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,293
Right.

698
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,795
You've got to ignore calls
from a man occasionally.

699
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,883
Sweetheart. Bring him to me.

700
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,886
I'm pretty picky
when it comes to men, you know.

701
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,972
Or next week,
bring him with you to my exhibition.

702
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,725
Mr. Kim's coming too.
Let's have dinner together.

703
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,561
It's okay. I'd rather not.

704
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,612
(suspenseful music)

705
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:08,865
What?

706
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,118
Oh, it's nothing.

707
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,244
Let's go inside.

708
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,873
(suspenseful music continues)

709
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,765
(line ringing)

710
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,059
AUTOMATED VOICE: The person
you have reached is not available.

711
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,396
(sighs deeply)

712
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,070
(cell phone vibrates)

713
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:50,531
MESSAGE
LEE PILYO

714
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,534
PILYO:
Are you okay? In any case, I'm sorry.

715
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,328
Let's talk after the shoot is over.

716
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,497
(exhales deeply)

717
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:03,962
MESSAGE
CHIEF CHA MINHU

718
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,380
MINHU: Pick up.

719
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,966
It's all a misunderstanding.
I'll explain everything.

720
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,138
(airplane engine rumbles)

721
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,476
(waves crashing)

722
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,770
(tranquil music)

723
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,025
JEJU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

724
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,159
(Roma exclaims)

725
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,831
Even the air feels different
in Jeju Island.

726
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:40,957
Look at that sky.

727
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,125
This is awesome.

728
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,293
Are you moving here permanently
or something?

729
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,131
You'll learn how comfortable it is
to shoot inside a studio

730
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,465
after going through hell.

731
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:53,594
So, are the others not out yet?

732
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:57,348
They got here on a morning flight.

733
00:41:57,432 --> 00:42:00,018
They probably escorted the clients
and went to pick up the vehicle

734
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,519
coming here by boat.

735
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,312
Ah...

736
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,739
We'll be shooting the wedding scene here,
the highlight of our commercial.

737
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,283
We'll use white and gold tomorrow

738
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,370
so that we can emphasize
the luxurious colors of the Mopix V9.

739
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,333
But...

740
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,253
I don't see our car.

741
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,923
The car was sent out yesterday afternoon
from the Mopix headquarters...

742
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:34,594
Are you saying you let someone
outside of the agency handle our vehicle?

743
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,220
Even after what happened?

744
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,015
That's not...

745
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,727
Ms. Hong told me to...

746
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,646
Of course, we made the personnel involved
in the transfer, embarkation,

747
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,982
and disembarkation
sign confidentiality agreements.

748
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,651
We're keeping everything secure
throughout the whole process.

749
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,071
All right, then.

750
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,158
MR. HAN SUNGHO

751
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,993
One moment, please.

752
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,331
Ms. Kim.

753
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,792
Isn't Ms. Hong in charge of this?

754
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:10,046
Yes, she left me in charge
and went to pick up the car herself.

755
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:20,640
EOMJI (in English): Okay!

756
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:22,975
Okay.

757
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,566
(in Korean)
Gosh. Sorry, it's so late.

758
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,692
(laughs)

759
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:35,571
I went through a lot of trouble
to keep it confidential.

760
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:38,032
Thank you. It looks like the car's fine.

761
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,326
PERSON IN CHARGE: HONG YESOOL

762
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,121
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

763
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,747
-Sure.
-Let's go.

764
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,000
(Eomji grunts)

765
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,927
(waves crashing)

766
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,598
I wish we could race through,
looking all cool.

767
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,767
(laughs)

768
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:08,146
If we get into an accident, you'd have to
take out the deposit for your apartment.

769
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,772
Come on, Yesool.

770
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,609
You're a first-rate killjoy.

771
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,738
Hey! You should be grateful to me.

772
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,158
Because Mr. Min hurt his leg,

773
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,119
you would've been stuck doing
the Production Team's work by yourself.

774
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,913
But I'm here helping you out.
Don't you know that?

775
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,665
I do.

776
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,835
I'm so thankful to you, my colleague.

777
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,588
That didn't sound genuine at all.
Do you even hear yourself?

778
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:37,175
-(cell phone vibrates)
-What's this?

779
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:40,178
MINHU: Come on, let's talk.
How long are you going to avoid me?

780
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,141
Damn. Hey.

781
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,935
You still haven't made up with Mr. Cha?

782
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,314
Gosh, no wonder.

783
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,107
I thought it was suspicious

784
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:56,068
when you should be escorting the client
along with Mr. Cha,

785
00:44:56,152 --> 00:45:01,157
yet you left that to a junior AE
and came to pick up the car.

786
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,701
You know how quick I am
at picking up these things.

787
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,953
If you're so quick,

788
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,498
how come you haven't noticed
that I'm in a bad mood?

789
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,501
I'm just worried. That's all.

790
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,504
You've been ignoring Cha Minhu's calls,

791
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,424
reporting work-related things
over long text messages.

792
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,677
You've been volunteering to work off-site,
so you don't cross paths with him.

793
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,346
Am I wrong?

794
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:25,765
Are you stalking me, Eomji?

795
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,059
Were you watching me and not working?

796
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,312
I don't know what's going on,
but you should talk it out in person.

797
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,564
I don't know
if it's because of Lee Pilyo or not,

798
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,567
but just meet with him and talk it out.

799
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,696
Imagine how frustrating
it must be for Mr. Cha.

800
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,074
You know,
you can be really harsh sometimes.

801
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,411
Gosh, I wouldn't want to
date you, either. Dang.

802
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,746
Hey, look. Dolphins.

803
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,456
NO CALLER ID

804
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,918
(cell phone vibrates)

805
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:01,842
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

806
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,444
What symptoms form the basis
for diagnosing a hydrocephalus patient?

807
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,530
Headache, vomiting, and papilledema, sir.

808
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,532
And the surgical method is?

809
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,910
Shunt, and drain the excessive CSF
into the peritoneal cavity.

810
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,622
What other surgery do you perform
in the case of an acute hydrocephalus

811
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,749
from a subdural hematoma
with tonic seizures?

812
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,628
Ah...

813
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,506
I'm not sure...

814
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,555
You're at the top of your class,
and you don't know that?

815
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,181
Tripping over a question like this?

816
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,394
I'll ask you again when we make
our next rounds. Be sure to study it.

817
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,023
(blows)

818
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,319
(playful music)

819
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,158
(sighs deeply)

820
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,752
(suspenseful music)

821
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,504
(grunting)
Who are you?

822
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,882
Wait. It's me. It's me, Pilyo.

823
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,508
Lee Pilyo?

824
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,552
(sighs deeply)

825
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,013
What are you doing in that thing?

826
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,681
What do you think?

827
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:34,894
It's in case someone records us again.
Think I want to cover up my handsome face?

828
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,939
Our shooting team
booked this entire place, so it's fine.

829
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,108
I'll take it off, then.

830
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,070
That feels better.

831
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,407
Why do you suddenly want
to edit the storyboard?

832
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,951
Don't you know
we're all set up for tomorrow?

833
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,161
I know.

834
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:55,373
But the only way I can meet you
is if it's for work.

835
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:56,957
Lee Pilyo.

836
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,876
We still have things to talk about.

837
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,670
But you just keep avoiding me.
What else am I supposed to do?

838
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,798
This is the only card I have.

839
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,009
We still have two dates left.

840
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,221
(light music)

841
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,182
-That's...
-I know.

842
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,477
You made that promise
before you started dating Cha Minhu.

843
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,396
Still, a promise is a promise.

844
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:22,233
Let's go on our second date
after we're done shooting tomorrow.

845
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,943
Are you crazy?

846
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,362
If you don't want to tell him,

847
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,322
I'll talk to Cha Minhu for you.

848
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,866
What are you going to tell him?

849
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,576
I'll tell him his girlfriend,

850
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,329
who's dating him
because she saw a happy future with him,

851
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:38,124
made a promise to meet with me twice,
so I hope he doesn't mind.

852
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:39,917
You are crazy, aren't you?

853
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,293
What's wrong?

854
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,712
Are you worried I might sway you?

855
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,220
Anyway, I'm going to meet with you,

856
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,013
and we're going to go on our second date.

857
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,851
Director Lee Pilyo.

858
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,603
You should turn in early if you want
to do well at the shoot tomorrow.

859
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,063
Please go inside.

860
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,400
See you tomorrow.

861
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,404
(light music)

862
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:11,866
(Seungtaek sighs)

863
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,076
(tongue clicks)

864
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:17,413
DOCTOR: Did you call for me?

865
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,791
Hey. How is Ban Howoo?

866
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,042
Pardon?

867
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,461
Ban Howoo?

868
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,380
The one who's at top of her class?

869
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:30,301
Do you think she ran away
because I yelled at her earlier?

870
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,344
Is she crying in a corner somewhere?

871
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,471
No.

872
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,431
She was eating just fine.

873
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,726
-What?
-I just saw her at the cafeteria.

874
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,145
She had some chicken piled up
in a bowl with a bunch of sausages

875
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,981
and chicken skewered on a chopstick
and was scarfing it down.

876
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:45,608
What?

877
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,736
-(indistinct chatter)
-STUDENT 1: Let me have one.

878
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,488
-Come on.
-STUDENT 2: Why are you eating so much?

879
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:51,989
I should eat this much to refuel.

880
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,742
It's so good.

881
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,870
She's going to eat that much chicken
at a time like this?

882
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:02,082
A vegan? What a joke.

883
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,001
This place has amazing chicken.

884
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,253
(grunts)

885
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,089
Come on.

886
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,467
-Are you eating for two?
-I have to go for seconds after this.

887
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,052
(sighs)
I must've been crazy.

888
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,763
I was crazy for worrying about her.

889
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,225
What's there to like about a girl
who's got a screw loose?

890
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,894
Fine, I'm going to forget about her.

891
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,147
I have women lined up wanting to date me.

892
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:29,026
Let's see how far this goes,
Ban Howoo. Dang it.

893
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,072
(exhales deeply)

894
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,702
Howoo, I won't disturb
your studies at all.

895
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:43,624
I'm just, you know,
a fidgeting application on your phone.

896
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,792
Just think of me like that.

897
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:49,588
You're human too.
So you won't be studying 24/7, right?

898
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,090
I know because I've been there.

899
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,800
If all you do is study, you know,

900
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,302
your head goes a little crazy.

901
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,304
Doctor.

902
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,473
Could you please get to the point?

903
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,976
You acting like this is interfering
with what I'm doing.

904
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,771
Sorry. Then I'll make it short
and get to the point real quick.

905
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,814
So listen up.

906
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,108
I'm sure you want to grab a bite
and go out to the movies

907
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,317
when you're studying.

908
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,944
And waiting for a taxi gets boring.

909
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,405
Call me then. Just call me.
No, I'll drive you.

910
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,283
So, what you're saying is that

911
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,326
you'll be my emergency response team.

912
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,327
Is that it?

913
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,954
You're so smart. You get it right away.

914
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,622
When you're struggling with your studies,

915
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:26,458
or when your seniors
are giving you a hard time, call me.

916
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:27,334
Just call me.

917
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,628
You need someone to talk to, Howoo.

918
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,882
So, you'll do all that
without anything in return?

919
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,302
Of course!

920
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,221
I'll think about it.

921
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,350
Sure, Howoo. Think about it.
Give it some thought.

922
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,269
Go and study now. Hurry, study.

923
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:46,770
Study hard!

924
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,107
OLLE TRAIL

925
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,693
Hold on. I said this before...

926
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,487
I said this before,

927
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:56,989
but I'll say it again.

928
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,782
Let me say this one more time.

929
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,909
-Because I don't like to be a fuddy-duddy.
-Damn it.

930
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,786
But I just feel so emotional right now.

931
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:05,873
-He's nuts.
-I...

932
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:08,375
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

933
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,419
(all cheer)

934
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,966
SANGGOO: Everyone, clap!

935
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:20,054
Hey, Let's play a game!

936
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,973
There you go again.

937
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,809
ALL: ♪ Boom boom clap, boom boom clap ♪

938
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,437
♪ Thump thump thump, thump thump thump ♪

939
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,168
YANG: This is Detective Yang
from Homicide Division 2.

940
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,503
We got the culprit.

941
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,796
You got the culprit?

942
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:58,425
Yes. He says he didn't
break into residence number 130.

943
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:01,887
But that's the usual excuse that they use.

944
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:06,141
They tend to lie about these things
to lessen their sentence.

945
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,852
But if we investigate,
everything will come out.

946
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,145
So don't worry about it, sir.

947
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:14,024
By chance, could you tell me
how tall the culprit is?

948
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,404
I think he's well over 180 cm tall.

949
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:19,697
Right.

950
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,949
He looks a bit different
from the description you gave.

951
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:26,745
You could've made a mistake
because you were preoccupied.

952
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,497
All right.

953
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,959
Please let me know
if you find anything unusual

954
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,837
-as you're conducting your investigation.
-Okay, I will.

955
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,131
(suspenseful music)

956
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,513
JIYOUNG:
Minhu, meet me on the first floor.

957
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:48,851
SARA: Hey, darling.

958
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,728
Did you take the picture of your dad
from home?

959
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:51,979
Dad's picture?

960
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,815
Why would I take that?

961
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,316
What are you talking about?

962
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,193
The picture is missing from the frame.

963
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,028
Why would the picture disappear?

964
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,365
Look for it carefully.

965
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:04,533
I'm hanging up.

966
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,498
What did I do wrong?

967
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,542
Why do I have to explain myself?

968
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,461
You really don't know?

969
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:19,089
Is this because of Hong Yesool?

970
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,178
I shot a movie all night,
and just got here on a night flight.

971
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,429
Must you do this to me?

972
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,934
I was just worried about you.

973
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:34,104
And, if you still haven't told her
about you,

974
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,231
that's the extent
of your feelings for her.

975
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,944
Are you sure your symptoms get better
when you kiss someone if Hong Yesool

976
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,404
is nearby?

977
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:44,114
Are you sure
you weren't just imagining it?

978
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:47,451
Regardless,
who are you to tell Hong Yesool that?

979
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,453
"Who do you think you are?"

980
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,666
How can you say that to me?

981
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,545
Minhu, it sounds like
you'll never see me again

982
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,381
if I say one more thing to Hong Yesool.

983
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,425
Yes, I won't see you again.

984
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,635
What?

985
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,596
If you say something stupid
to Yesool one more time,

986
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,598
I won't ever see you again.

987
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,391
I'll be the one to tell her about it.

988
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,061
I don't need you
to worry about me anymore.

989
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,146
This is my last warning.

990
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,232
Warning?

991
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,401
This is the last time I let it slide
for Dr. Oh's sake.

992
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,405
You were attracted to Hong Yesool

993
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,574
because she eases your pain, right?

994
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,537
Are you sure about that, though?
It might not be the case.

995
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,754
Hey! Oh Jiyoung.

996
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:51,306
Hong Yesool!

997
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,267
(grunts)

998
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:58,021
Minhu! Are you okay?

999
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,400
(dramatic music)

1000
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:03,986
MINHU: Hey, Hong Yesool.

1001
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,825
Hong Yesool. Wait. Talk to me.

1002
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,661
Let's talk later.

1003
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,079
Later when?

1004
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,540
You've been ignoring my calls and texts.

1005
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,959
Then what should I say in this situation?

1006
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,169
I'll explain everything.

1007
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:23,130
Including what I couldn't tell you
last time.

1008
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,172
I don't want to hear it.

1009
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:27,551
What more do I need to hear
when I've seen it with my own eyes?

1010
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,554
It's a misunderstanding.
I told you, I can explain everything.

1011
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,638
I don't want to hear it!

1012
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,809
I don't care if you told Oh Jiyoung
about me or not,

1013
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,020
or if something is going on
between you two.

1014
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,939
-What?
-It's for the best anyway.

1015
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,610
I don't think things will work out
between us anyway.

1016
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,534
Is it because of Lee Pilyo?

1017
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,244
(pants)

1018
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,580
Why would you bring him up right now?

1019
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:58,165
He got to you, didn't he?

1020
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:02,044
Isn't that why
you couldn't answer him earlier

1021
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,171
when he asked if you were swayed?

1022
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:06,673
What?

1023
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,886
Were you eavesdropping on us?

1024
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,179
That's not important right now.

1025
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:16,475
Isn't it more important
that you let him get to you like that?

1026
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,520
Do you think I've been swayed?

1027
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,398
Weren't you?

1028
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,110
Yes.

1029
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,737
I was.

1030
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,073
So...

1031
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,534
let's just end it here.

1032
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:37,704
I think we need to reconsider

1033
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,248
pursuing a relationship.

1034
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,960

Really.

1050

They're... very hip.

1052

They drink really well too.

1053
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,649
They're young.

1054
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,235
And...

1055
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,822
so handsome!

1056

1057
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,369
Are you asleep?

1058
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,622
You took off during dinner again.

1059
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,709
So petty. Are you sleeping?

1060
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:48,752
Dang it.

1061
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,171
Come on! Are you asleep?

1062
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,549
Hey.

1063
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,348
Where is she?

1064
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,976
This must not be the right room.

Is that girl Hong Yesool
with Mr. Cha right now?

1067
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,412
I was going to have just one drink.

1068
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:26,373
Does she realize the time?

1069
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,668
I'm so jealous.

1072
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,182
Did something happen?

1073
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,768
By any chance,

1074
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,312
are you with Yesool right now?

1075
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:50,856
Isn't she in her room?

1076
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:52,190
No, she's not.

1077
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,943
And she's not picking up, either.

1078
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,946
You were with her, weren't you?

1079
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,656
You look suspicious.

1080
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,952
Yes, he was. I was right.
