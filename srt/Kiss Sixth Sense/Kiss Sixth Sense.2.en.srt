(rain pattering)

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,221
YESOOL: Mr. Cha.
(gasps)

00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,223
(shrieks)

00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:20,437

(shatters)

8
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,633
YESOOL: My sixth sense.

9
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,178
I've never foreseen something like this.

10
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,100
I foresaw a future
that should never happen.

11
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,609
(dramatic music)

12
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,866

00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,771
(gasps)

15
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,940
(breathes roughly)
I can't believe it.

16
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,110
-(moans in pain)
-YESOOL: Well...

17
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,403
(pants)
I...

18
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,404
No, stop.

19
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,907
Don't scream.

20
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,951
What was that? Cha Minhu and I...

21
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,078
That was an accident.

22
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,579
It's all right.

23
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,206
It's no big deal.

24
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,292
Pull yourself together
and finish the work.

25
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,877
Wait, Mr. Cha.
(gasps)

26

(Minhee screams)

28
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,346
-MINHEE: Ms. Hong! It's raining!
-Explain the situation to our staff.

29
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,639
(exclaims)

31
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,563
(stuttering)
The bed! The bed is worth 20 million won!

32
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,482
-ROMA: It's out there.
-SANGGOO: Let's go get it!

33
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,943
-Dang it!
-Yesool. What happened?

34
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,362
No...

35
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,988
Nothing happened.

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,199
Get back to work.

37
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,284
Okay.

38
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,705
What was that?

39
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,751
What did I just see?

40
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,422
(dramatic music)

41
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,718
(Minhee screams)

42
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,055
(grunts)

43
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,066
What the hell

44
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,111
am I doing

45
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,490
with Cha Minhu in the future?

46
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,200
(inhales)

47
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,493
(sighs)

48
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,662
What do I do now?

49
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,623
-Holy smokes. Hey.
-(breathes roughly)

50
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,500
It's heavier now that it's wet. Jesus.

51
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,794
(pants)

52
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,380
-(grunts)
-Oh, dear.

53
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,756
Yesool.

54
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,384
Did something happen?

55
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,474
You know, Mr. Cha and you on the bed.
(giggles)

56
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,559
It seemed that something happened
between you two...

57
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,852
Where's Mr. Cha?

58
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,729
(breathes deeply)

59
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,940
(pants)

60
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,193
(in a quiet voice)
What happened?

61
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,528
-Ms. Hong!
-(moans softly)

62
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,530
Tell me what happened!

63
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,991
Yes, there is.
There is something between them.

64
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,660
(moans suspiciously)

65
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,496
(indistinct chatter)

66
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,416
Well, Mr. Cha. Well...
(gasps)

67
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,043
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,088
-Huh?
-Huh?

69
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,175
Huh?

70
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,386
(dramatic music)

71
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,935
Why does he not have it?

72
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,520
Huh?

73
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,356
-You know, on your back...
-Hey.

74
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,525
What are you doing now?

75
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,777
Wait just a second.

76
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,695
I clearly saw it earlier.

77
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,114
-You had a scar on your back...
-Hey.

78
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,951
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

79
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,286
Hong Yesool. Get out.

80
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,914
Why is it not there?

81
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,750
Huh? What are you talking about?

82
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,794
Hong Yesool. I said, get out.

83
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,838
Get out!

84
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,923
(quirky music)

85
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,227
(sighs)

86
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,603
(door closes)

87
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,898
Was I mistaken?

88
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,192
Well, it was clearly there.

89
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,156
Me and Cha Minhu?

90
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,951
That can't be.

91
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,538
SANGGOO:
Hey, guys! Be careful when you lift it!

92
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,208
Okay, okay! Now let's go!
You can do it! All right, do your best!

93
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,334
Yes.

94
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,794
-(man grunts)
-SANGGOO: Lift it. Be careful.

95
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,920
MAN: Oh, boy.

96
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,548
(Kyungseok clears throat)

97
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,260
(blows)

98
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,095
(sniffles)

99
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,764
Hey, Mr. Cha.

100
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,182
(sighs)

101
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,893
This is just part of our job.

102
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,979
You know, a series of coincidences
and baffling situations.

103
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,273
The rainy weather is, well,

104
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,108
beyond our control.

105
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,651
Come on.

106
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,695
Let's make it work though.

107
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,572
-We can do it!
-(moans in pain)

108
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,823
We...

109
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,035
That's why we have a manual.

110
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,245
We were supposed to set it up
this morning.

111
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,665
Excuse me, guys.
Please be careful with that.

112
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,500
-Carefully. Please.
-MAN: Okay.

113
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,210
At worst, we can just use indoor shots.

114
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,921
We both are quite experienced
in this kind of thing.

115
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,465
We experienced much worse...

116
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,258
(clears throat)

117
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,018
(sucks air)
Good morning, sir.

118
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,855
Let's...
(sighs)

119
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,024
Mr. Cha. Mr...

120
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,985
Jesus, that rude brat.

121
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,197
The damn rain, for God's sake.

122
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,909
-AD. Are you ready?
-Yes?

123
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,036
-Oh, yes. We're good to go.
-All right. Let's begin.

124
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,120
Okay.

125
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,124
All right. One, two. Action!

126
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,003
Wake up.

127
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,174
Get up.

128
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,762
Stretch yourself once. Very good.

129
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,764
Pan the camera.

130
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,731
KYUNGSEOK:
Step aside. Don't get in my way.

131
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,109
The main color of our new bed
is mahogany brown.

132
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,360
But you're taking that out?

133
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,780
It hasn't been released yet,
so it'll be difficult to get it today.

134
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,658
-But we'll schedule an additional shoot...
-KYUNGSEOK: Come on.

135
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,660
CGI is so advanced these days.

136
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,286
Mahogany brown?

137
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,830
We can make it look the same...

138
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,748
Then why do we even bother
doing the shoot?

139
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,500
Just take the bed out
and use CGI to add it!

140
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,045
Do you want me to get fired or what?

141
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,255
(stuttering)
No.

142
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,632
It's not that. I was just...

143
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:30,927
Hey.

144
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,139
(whispers)
Hey. You're the PM. Do something about it.

145
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,268
Let's take it out. Let's take out the bed.

146
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,353
Well, if we remove the bed...

147
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,733
(light music)

148
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,070
I like this one better than that one.
What do you think? I like it.

149
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,531
-YESOOL: It should be fine, right?
-EOMJI: Good. Let's go for this.

150
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,741
Let's go.

151
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,035
(light music continues)

152
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,791
I'm not sure about this.

153
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,835
I'm not sure if our director

154
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,795
will like a bed commercial without a bed.

155
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,298
The director asked for a commercial

156
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,633
that makes people curious about the brand.

157
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,011
I believe our new plan meets the need.

158
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,763
And it'll definitely be effective.

159
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,474
We'll make people imagine
the product in the space

160
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,892
where the product is missing.

161
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,353
We'll add the sound of rain
and sounds of nature

162
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,147
to make it look like a bed is there...

163
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,775
Then you should've proposed it
in the first place!

164
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,778
You know the commercial
for Jet Washing Machine

165
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,571
that recently got 10 million views, right?

166
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,616
Its concept was changed on the set,
but it made a big hit.

167
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,994
Sometimes, a situation like this
brings about a better result.

168
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,713
(sighs)

169
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,050
(light music)

170
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,107
(sighing)
Jeez.

171
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,942
ROMA (on camera):
Oh, Sanggoo. Where are you going?

172
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:09,901
Me?

173
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,028
I'm on my way to get some props.
Good luck.

174
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,822
Hey, Minhee. Let's go together, huh?

175
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,949
Okay, come. I need to get some props too.

176
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,829
KYUNGSEOK: Man, it's killing me.

177
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,706
Mr. Yeom. We couldn't prepare coffee,
so have some juice instead.

178
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,959
Come on. If you don't have coffee,
you should go get some.

179
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,545
-Well, but...
-Think, for God's sake!

180
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,880
-Well, but...
-No, you drink it. You...

181
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,134
Why didn't the production team
put this thing away?

182
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,343
EOMJI (sighing): Goodness.

183
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,387
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,764
I told you to stop filming, you punk!

185
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,933
-EOMJI: Oh, dear.
-(sighs)

186
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,686
-Cut!
-Holy shit.

187
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,730
(chuckles awkwardly)
We'll take a 10-minute break.

188
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,608
-We'll take a 10-minute break!
-MINHEE: Okay.

189
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,985
SANGGOO: A 10-minute break.

190
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,696
(indistinct chatter)

191
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,836
Good work.

192
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,504
-EOMJI: Yeah, good work.
-MINHEE: Good work. Good work.

193
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,798
EOMJI: Director.
Thank you for your hard work.

194
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,383
-Thank you for your hard work. Bye.
-MANAGER: Let's go. Be careful, Jiyoung.

195
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,551
Oh, sir. Are you leaving?

196
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,595
(clears throat)

197
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,183
(groans with fatigue)

198
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,353
We managed to finish it somehow.

199
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,941
Seriously, I feel like
my lifespan shortens

200
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,485
every time we do a shoot.

201
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,572
(sucks air)

202
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,075
You're acting strangely today.

203
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,495
(sucks air)
No wonder.

204
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,831
It's your first time working as a PM.
I'm sure it's tough.

205
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,251
By the way, where's Master Cha?

206
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,213
He usually stays on set
until the end and nags you.

207
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,715
I know.

208
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,801
He didn't seem to be feeling well.

209
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,345
"Feeling well."

210
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,598
-KYUNGSEOK: Hey, Jang Eomji!
-(gasps)

211
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,058
Yes, I'm coming!
(stuttering)

212
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,184
Come quickly!

213
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,769
I'd better perform an exorcism
or something so I won't work

214
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,229
on the same team with that asshole.
I've got to go.

215
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,855
(sighs)

216
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,652
Yesool.

217
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,698
Did something happen between you
and Mr. Cha on the bed this morning?

218
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,700
No.

219
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,869
(soft chuckle)
Go pack up.

220
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,329
What could possibly have happened?

221
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,460
I'm sure something happened.
(giggles)

222
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,296
(Minhu breathes deeply)

223
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,427
(pants)

224
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,388
(groans)

225
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,641
(panting)

226
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,772
(light music)

227
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,914
-What? You slept with Cha Minhu?
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

228
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,958
Keep it down.
I didn't say I slept with him.

229
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,961
It's the same thing.
That means it's going to happen soon.

230
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,880
Stop talking crazy.
I'm already confused enough.

231
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,008
(sighs)

232
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,554
But the thing is, it wasn't there.

233
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,805
What?

234
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,849
The scar.

235
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,766
The scar?

236
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:33,730
(sighs)

237
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,273
(tuts)
Yesool.

238
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,608
Did you even sleep 10 hours this week?

239
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,527
I had no time to sleep.

240
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,571
I had to work on the campaigns
and fix the mishaps.

241
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,281
Exactly.

242
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,366
I guess you just imagined it
due to lack of sleep.

243
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,994
You see Cha Minhu regularly
in your dreams.

244
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,204
Saying your proposal is crap
and you need to write it again,

245
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,123
making all that fuss, he runs
after you all night long, you said.

246
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,083
(smacking lips)
It was just your imagination.

247
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,877
-(slurps)
-You think so?

248
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,255
You and Cha Minhu are sleeping together?
Does that make sense?

249
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,882
Of course not.

250
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,138
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

251
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,308
-Why?
-I'm not some kind of insect.

252
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,893
It was just an accident.

253
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,270
But he treated me
like some vermin afterward.

254
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,271
See?

255
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,398
You and that punk?

256
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,609
Not a chance.

257
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:20,985
No, no.

258
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,404
-(sighs)
-Oh.

259
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,323
I'll go get more beer.

260
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,491
(sniffles)

261
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:30,995
(door opens)

262
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,080
(sighs)

263
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,792
But it's hard to say
it was an imaginary thing.

264
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,711
(moans in terror)

265
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,255
(sighing)
It was a delusion.

266
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,841
Go away, ghosts.
(groaning)

267
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,928
(moans in frustration)

268
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,184
(engine roars)

269
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,943
(car horn honking)

270
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,245
(breathes roughly)

271
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,555
SEOUL, OFFICE OF HAN RIVER

272
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,104
(motorcycle engine roars)

273
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,481
OBEY TRAFFIC SIGNALS

274
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,775
(engine roaring)

275
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,073
(smacking lips)
Hello.

276
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,992
A motorcycle gang is riding on the road

277
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,869
between Gangbyeon Expressway
and Seoul Forest.

278
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,163
Please do something about them.

279
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,499
Seoul Gangnam Gyeo 2037.

280
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,210
Seoul Seongdong Hyo 5448.

281
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,589
Seoul Seongdong Ryeo 4170.

282
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,968
They've been riding around this area
for 30 minutes already.

283
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,807
(elevator dings)

284
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,435
Hi, Dad.

285
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,979
I'm almost at Minhu's apartment.

286
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,857
Well, Seungtaek said he's fine.

287
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,443
But I should see for myself.

288
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,781
Come on, Dad. What's the big deal
about having a meal together this weekend?

289
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,867
He's sick. He needs to rest.

290
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,661
Seriously, people would think
heâ€™s your biological son.

291
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,121
Uh-huh.

292
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,665
-(sighs)
-(cell phone beeps)

293
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,460
(inhales deeply)

294
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,048
(gasps)

295
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,008
How do you know my lock code?

296
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,135
What happened? Who is it this time?

297
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,054
-Right?
-(sighs)

298
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,639
That's why you're sick, right?

299
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,141
So who on earth is it this time?

300
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:58,976
Ah!

301
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,645
Hey, leave before I get mad.

302
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,896
You think I don't know?

303
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,941
You got sick like this before
when we kissed.

304
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,443
That wasn't a kiss.
Your lips just bumped against mine.

305
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,861
It's the same thing.

306
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,113
So whose lips bumped
against yours this time?

307
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,784
What if the paparazzi take photos
of you coming here without your manager?

308
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,245
I would love to
get photographed by the paparazzi.

309
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,331
And I... also want to kiss you.

310
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,499
(scoffs)

311
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,959
Okay.
(laughs awkwardly)

312
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,461
All right.
Then shall we go out for a walk first?

313
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,588
Okay.
(laughs)

314
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,507
You said you were sick,

315
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,384
so I spent quite some time
to make this for you.

316
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,387
Small octopus and abalone porridge,
your favorite.

317
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,972
Oh, you got it from Green Hotel.

318
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,848
And you ate it already. Mm.

319
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,017
(sighs)
Who am I trying to fool?

320
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,772
I'm free tomorrow. Should I look
after you all through the night?

321
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,941
On the bed. Huh? Huh?

322
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,651
(gasps)

323
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,570
-Jiyoung.
-Yes?

324
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,696
Bye.

325
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,826
Minhu. Minhu! Minhu!

326
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,495
(quirky music)

327
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,845
LUAPEN

328
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,138
(sighs)

329
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,973
(groans)

330
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,273
(bottle clanks)

331
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,618
-You know, on your back...
-What are you doing now?

332
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,244
You had a scar on your back...

333
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,830
Hey. Why do you keep talking nonsense?

334
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:43,956
(sighs)

335
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,460
Cha Minhu must've thought
I'm a total weirdo.

336
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,424
Get your head on straight, Hong Yesool.

337
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,428
Don't say anything stupid
when you see Cha Minhu tomorrow.

338
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:01,057
Do your job with perfection
as if nothing has happened.

339
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,184
Yes.

340
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,519
(blows)

341
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,398
(sighs)

342
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,283
(gasps)
Yesool.

343
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,410
I can't get a hold of Mr. Cha.

344
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,039
-What? Well, why?
-(moans uncertainly)

345
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,584
The meeting starts soon.

346
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,378
Sick leave, monthly holidays,
and vacations...

347
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,296
He never took any of them
and made us feel uncomfortable.

348
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,090
-And he hasn't come in yet?
-MINHEE: No.

349
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,092
Ms. Hong. Do you know anything?

350
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,551
It's strange.

351
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,720
Well, I don't know either.

352
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,724
SUNHEE: If you don't know Cha Minhu's
whereabouts, then who does?

353
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,894
You're obviously his work spouse.

354
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,313
Goodness. I'm not his work spouse.

355
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,026
You're the only person in this company
he cares about.

356
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,528
Everyone here knows that.

357
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,155
Not me. I don't.

358
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:03,202
What makes you think he cares about her?
He always nags and picks on her.

359
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,037
(scoffs)

360
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,333
Teams two and three are not
in good moods. Read the room, will you?

361
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,086
Ms. Jo Sunhee. I heard that
your team lost all your battles.

362
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,629
But we renewed all our contracts.

363
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,841
(both laugh mockingly)

364
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,050
(snorts)

365
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,010
(soft chuckle)

366
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,471
Ms. Hong. Let's go to the meeting.

367
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,014
Okay.

368
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,225
Let's go for now.

369
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,687
-Huh? Oh, okay.
-MINHEE: I'll keep calling him.

370
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,234
(light music)

371
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,701
(inhales)

372
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,164
You know.

373
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,711
A bed commercial that doesn't show a bed?

374
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,255
The idea is brilliant and good.

375
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,468
(sucks air)
But a commercial without a product?

376
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,387
Well, I'm not sure about that.

377
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,014
It worries me.

378
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,517
You know the damage to our premium bed
comes to 20 million won, right?

379
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,811
It's not even in the commercial.

380
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:11,979
Well...
(chuckles awkwardly)

381
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,690
Yes. The thing is...

382
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,487
It's Ms. Hong's first time as a PM.

383
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,740
She doesn't have much experience,
so she made many mistakes.

384
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,992
I sincerely apologize on her behalf.

385
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,077
She should've checked

386
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,789
the weather report
or if we had an extra bed.

387
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,918
We'll spend more time
on the post-synchronization...

388
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:34,835
Come on.

389
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,505
We're not here to talk about
the post-production process.

390
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,256
Is there any other way to fix this?

391
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,968
Where is Mr. Cha?

392
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,721
KYUNGSEOK: Mr. Cha?

393
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,518
KYUNGSEOK: Oh, he's here.

394
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,353
I'm sorry I'm late.

395
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,859
(whispers)
I think we're out of luck.

396
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,363
Last year, they demanded a reshoot,
saying the blanket had a crease.

397
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,657
And they combined it with the first one.

398
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,535
(chuckles)
They're being nasty again.

399
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,869
I'll begin.

400
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,289
These are the strategies that we propose.

401
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,835
One of them is to create momentum
that can imprint

402
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,420
the brand "Billy" on people's minds
without showing its products.

403
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,006
(sucks air)
What does that mean?

404
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,677
By not exposing
the brand name and the bed,

405
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,971
we'll make people try an online search
for "Billy" themselves.

406
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,556
(inhales deeply)

407
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,516
-After that, we'll open a pop-up store...
-(sighs)

408
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,436
...to let customers experience the brand
both on and offline.

409
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,481
That way, they can team up
with the brand as voluntary marketers.

410
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,650
And that's the objective of this campaign.

411
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,404
(sucks air)
But I think it's too risky

412
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,073
not to show the product at all.

413
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,033
Hmm.

414
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,077
POP-UP STORE...

415
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,122
"Nothing happens without taking risks."

416
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,040
This is what the president
of Billy said in his interview.

417
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,375
And thanks to the risks he took,

418
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,711
Billy has become the biggest
bed company in this country.

419
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,922
Strategies that entail great risks
often make changes

420
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,924
because they have great potential.

421
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,235
(soft music)

422
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,448
KYUNGSEOK: Take care, sir.

423
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,994
(sighs)
For God's sake.

424
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,412
(Eomji laughs)

425
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,415
(Kyungseok sighs)
This is killing me.

426
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,584
-(Minhee laughs)
-EOMJI: Good job. Good job, everyone.

427
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,502
MINHEE: Oh, dear.
(sighs)

428
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,715
You need to work
on the Morphis campaign too.

429
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,759
Can you handle the pop-up store?

430
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,679
The schedule
has been very tight for months.

431
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,514
We can handle it.

432
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:55,392
The Morphis Automobile project is the one

433
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,270
that our vice-president cares
a lot about. You know that, right?

434
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,272
And regarding Hong Yesool...

435
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,067
It's too early for her to be a PM.

436
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,193
Exclude her.

437
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,363
Taking charge of the pop-up store
would be too much for her.

438
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,697
I'll assist her.

439
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,453
Handling the project from beginning to end
will help her get a grasp of the work.

440
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,997
I'll take my leave now.

441
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,501
(sighs)

442
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,587
(door closes)

443
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,422
Mr. Yeom.

444
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,093
It's true that I'm not
experienced enough to work as a PM.

445
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,720
But I asked you several times
to follow the manual

446
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,598
because we didn't have a spare bed.
And I had a hard time reaching you.

447
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,184
You must know that's the reason
the problem couldn't be handled properly.

448
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,728
You know how many missed calls
you got from me, right?

449
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,730
-By any chance...
-Hey!

450
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,609
Are you kidding me?
The plan was flawed from the start.

451
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,278
You can't put the blame
on the production team!

452
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,865
To save the budget, you rented the place
for a short period of time.

453
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,326
What an amazing job you did!

454
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,869
Your team is the one to blame.

455
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,622
And what's the duty of a PM?

456
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:02,126
You should've followed me around
to have it all under control!

457
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,752
(sighs)
But...

458
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:04,753
What?

459
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,256
If you have anything to say,
then say it. Go on!

460
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,383
What's with the look on your face? You...

461
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,018
Get back to work.

462
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,359
(sighs)

463
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,419
Is this the way the planning team
deals with things?

464
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,421
Come on.

465
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,882
I've been working in this field
as a CD for 15 years.

466
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,426
Why should I be treated like this?
Think about it, Mr. Cha.

467
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,721
KYUNGSEOK: I don't think you trained
your staff properly.

468
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,140
-Did you see how rude she was to me?
-(sighs)

469
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,267
How long do I have to put up with this?

470
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,146
Now what? What is it this time?

471
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,649
We just do what the planning team
tells us to do. Don't you know that?

472
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,069
Both the directing
and production teams become

473
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,821
nothing more than puppets
when we work with your team.

474
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,199
And we set up the bed

475
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,785
with the permission of Hong Yesool.

476
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,872
You had the first party
at Sohyang Club in Hannam-dong.

477
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,207
Huh?

478
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,000
Sohyang...

479
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,878
Jeez, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

480
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,881
(shouts in surprise)

481
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,217
-(groans)
-Jeez, there was a fly.

482
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,218
(stuttering)
A fly?

483
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,929
And you had the second party at Sky Bar.

484
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,388
As you were busy hanging out

485
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,015
with Mr. Kim and Mr. Lee
from KS Production

486
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,601
and many girls from the bar,

487
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,770
you didn't answer
dozens of calls from Ms. Hong.

488
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,855
That's why you arrived
at the set the next morning, right?

489
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:50,359
(snores)
How did you know that?

490
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,402
You ruined the work
because you were busy partying.

491
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,154
But you put the blame on Ms. Hong.

492
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,573
Is that your know-how as a CD
with 15 years' experience?

493
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,950
This isn't the first time.

494
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,868
Last time, you flaked on a shoot

495
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,329
because you were busy being wined
and dined by a model agency.

496
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,540
So far, I'm the only person
who knows that.

497
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,958
(gulps)

498
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,167
(gasps)

499
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,169
(stuttering)
What are you doing?

500
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,171
(stuttering)
Are you threatening me or something?

501
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,591
Why are you bringing that up
in a situation like this?

502
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,678
-Should I continue?
-No.

503
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,929
I mean...

504
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,306
That's not what I meant.
(snorts)

505
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,809
Oh, man.

506
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,770
Okay, okay, okay.

507
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,146
(sucks air)

508
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,357
Listen to me, Mr. Cha.

509
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,068
First of all, we're on the same team.

510
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,863
We should work together to make
the pop-up store a success, right?

511
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,239
(laughs)

512
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,282
(moans in pain)

513
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:42,369
Jeez, why are there so many flies here?

514
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,204
(smacking lips)
Ouch.

515
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,876
He's so rude and obnoxious.

516
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:51,837
(sighs)

517
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,807
(exhales deeply)

518
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,562
(sighs)

519
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,610
I don't want you to apologize.

520
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,155
Just don't do anything
you'll be sorry for.

521
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,489
That's all I ask of you.

522
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,951
You're the PM of this campaign, all right?

523
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,121
If you're going to get intimidated
by your higher-ups, just quit.

524
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,415
Jeez.

525
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,169
What? Do you have something to say?

526
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:37,049
The bed commercial without a bed.
How long did you work on that?

527
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,927
I saw the proposal on your desk
the other day.

528
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,429
Why didn't you say anything about it?

529
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,972
You asked me to have faith in you.

530
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,308
You said you wanted
to take full responsibility

531
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,102
for the project as a PM. That's why.
All I did was have faith in you.

532
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,024
(sighs)

533
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,692
All right. I'll be honest with you.

534
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,279
I expected that you'd make mistakes.

535
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,075
But since I let you take charge
of the project,

536
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,994
I thought I should let you experience
going through the whole process too.

537
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,246
And I still have

538
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,248
faith in you.

539
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,796
Thank you.

540
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,424
No need to say that either.

541
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,052
Don't rely on me to the point
where'd you would feel grateful.

542
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,641
Do you have time on your hands?

543
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,017
Get back to work.

544
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:36,316
(light music)

545
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,077
(door opens)

546
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,371
(door closes)

547
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,289
(scoffs)

548
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,340
Roma.

549
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,093
Let's go drink some coffee.
Who wants to drink coffee?

550
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,594
-EOMJI: Me.
-No one else? Okay.

551
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,763
-EOMJI: What? Me.
-ROMA: We'll be back.

552
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,057
Ro... What the hell?
(tuts)

553
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,894
(sighs)

554
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,312
(hums)

555
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,443
PEOPLE WHO WRITE A NEW HISTORY
OF ADVERTISEMENT ZEU AD

556
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,071
-Why aren't you searching for references?
-(grunts)

557
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,285
Ms. Hong.

558
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:31,830
Ms. Hong.

559
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,333
I emailed them to you 30 minutes ago.

560
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,626
(sighs)

561
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,883
And what's more important
than this pop-up store is

562
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:48,430
finding the other half of my life
at the...

563
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,807
(whispers)
...at the 30-year anniversary banquet.

564
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:51,975
(sighs)

565
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,188
Make some time when the event is over.

566
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,066
We should get dressed up this time.

567
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,569
(smacks lips)

568
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,614
(sobbingly)
My boyfriend seems to be missing.

569
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:06,990
Huh?

570
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,117
What are you saying?

571
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,702
(inhales)

572
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,913
(sighs)
I said I'd work overtime for two weeks.

573
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,956
And I haven't heard from him
for three days.

574
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,543
(chuckles awkwardly)
Should I call the police?

575
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:22,506
Hmm. You call it a breakup.

576
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,509
(sighs)
If I continue to work as an AE,

577
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,136
I may not be able to get married
because I can't even date a guy.

578
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,847
How many times did this happen already?

579
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,767
-(breathes roughly)
-So find someone in this company.

580
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,562
Go out on a date after working overtime.

581
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,023
And after staying up all night,

582
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,567
you know, kiss.

583
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,071
Within the same building,...

584
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,366
(chuckles)
...you can do everything you want to do.

585
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,327
You should come to the
anniversary banquet.

586
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,288
Join us and try
to hook up with a nice guy at the party.

587
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,165
Do you have time to date a guy?

588
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,251
You should work.

589
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,131
Jeez, you little

590
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,716
Cha Minhu, for God's sake.

591
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,262
(sucks air)
Actually, the most eligible bachelor

592
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,763
in this company is Cha Minhu.

593
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,641
That's right.

594
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:18,103
He would be perfect if he wasn't scary.

595
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,857
What would it be like to date Cha Minhu?

596
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,276
(chuckles)
That'd be nice.

597
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,652
Think about today.

598
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,988
He just showed up out of nowhere
and fixed everything for us.

599
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,322
(giggles)

600
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,449
I've thought...

601
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,036
about that too.
(laughs)

602
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,621
About what?

603
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,166
Going out...

604
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,501
-with Cha Minhu.
-(exclaims)

605
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,003
(exclaims)

606
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,630
(both giggle)

607
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,299
(laughs)

608
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,467
I think it'd be great to go out with him.

609
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,721
Do you think you can handle him?

610
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,140
What? What are you talking about?

611
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,102
Do you really want to go out
with such a sociopath?

612
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,188
(quirky music)

613
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,071
(upbeat music)

614
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:26,004
Hong Yesool. Didn't you read the sign?

615
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,131
That I'm going to ask you out today.

616
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,091
(gasps in bewilderment)
What?

617
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,260
You're too dull to be an AE,
for God's sake.

618
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,762
Just quit your job!

619
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,806
And you can go out with me if you want.

620
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,768
What?

621
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,438
Is this how you want to be asked out?

622
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,857
Hong Yesool!

623
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,110
Do you come to work to show off
how incompetent you are?

624
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,779
(groaning)

625
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,281
-I stayed up all night to do this.
-You're making an excuse again!

626
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,616
You're all talk.

627
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,910
I told you not to do anything
you'd be sorry for!

628
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,872
By the way,...

629
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,333
(pants)
...do you know how to kiss?

630
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,335
What?

631
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,796
I can't kiss you all night long though.

632
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,049
Kiss! Kiss!

633
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,968
-(screams)
-Kiss!

634
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,512
(smacks lips)

635
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,933
Is that the kind of kiss you want?

636
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,977
(breathes fearfully)

637
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,311
Forget it.

638
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,064
Let's not talk about him.
Not even casually.

639
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,024
You guys know nothing about Cha the Jerk.

640
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,734
If you know him that well,
why don't you go out with him?

641
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:30,860
Are you crazy?

642
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,529
(Eomji tongue clicks)

643
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,365
Ms. Hong. No, sit down.

644
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:36,866
Oh, okay.

645
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,828
(clears throat, sniffs)

646
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,414
Can we talk for a minute?

647
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,263
(sighs)

648
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,015
KYUNGSEOK: So, Ms. Hong.

649
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,100
I'm wondering which company

650
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,645
you're going to subcontract
to set up the pop-up store.

651
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,188
I contacted the production company

652
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,232
that set up the perfume pop-up store
with us last time.

653
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,442
Is there a problem?

654
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,736
(gasps)
See? I knew it.

655
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,237
Are you crazy, Ms. Hong?

656
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,989
They're not cost-effective.
You didn't know?

657
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,907
Oh, boy.

658
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,743
(smacks lips)

659
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:20,869
Here.

660
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,122
KIM PRODUCTION, PRESIDENT KIM SEUNGHYUK

661
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,916
This is my friend's company.

662
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,294
This is the one that set up
a pop-up store for Caddi Camera.

663
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:33,256
It was different from the floor plan,
so we had to go through a lot of trouble.

664
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,591
And it went over the budget.

665
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,093
That was...

666
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,428
Right.

667
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,972
The assistant director didn't hand
the revised version to them, so...

668
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,557
We don't have much time left,

669
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,518
so I think we should choose the company
that we worked with last time.

670
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:46,645
Fine.

671
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,772
Good luck with that.

672
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,817
Let's see how well that goes.

673
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,865
I WANT TO JOIN ZEU AD!
PLEASE PICK ME! DON'T LOSE ME!

674
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,507
HELP ME BECOME A PM WHO IMPRESSES
THE WHOLE NATION

675
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,967
I'LL BECOME THE PM OF THE MORPHIS CAMPAIGN

676
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,865
PLEASE HELP ME COMPLETE MY FIRST PROJECT
AS A PM WITHOUT A HITCH

677
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,755
BIRTH OF ZELUS

678
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:02,762
JEONIN SHOPPING CENTER

679
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:09,018
YESOOL: Since they feel comfortable
using social media,

680
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,520
I think we should go for...

681
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,939
They can also enjoy shopping online.

682
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,066
We'd better have a shoot.

683
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,652
I think we should make the best use of it.

684
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,612
-Let's wrap it up.
-ROMA: Thank you.

685
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,281
MINHEE: Thank you.

686
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,492
Okay. Go for this.

687
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,577
Yes, sir.

688
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,498
(door opens)

689
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,125
(door closes)

690
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,054
-(Eomji coughs)
-Is everything going well?

691
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,639
-Of course, ma'am.
-Goodness!

692
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,850
-I'll put it right here. Is that okay?
-Yes, go ahead.

693
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,976
Jeez, look at the dust.
(coughs)

694
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,060
Excuse me, sir.

695
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,479
Please don't make creases.
Do it carefully.

696
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,731
It has to be neat. That's the key.
Please make it look neat.

697
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:56,900
I told you to throw this away.

698
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,610
KYUNGSEOK: Man.

699
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,446
Come on, get up.

700
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,198
I have a plan.

701
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,866
I'm going to share pictures
of this on my social media accounts.

702
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,785
-Look how soft this is.
-For God's sake.

703
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,036
If I post the pictures,
it'll attract a lot of attention.

704
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,412
Get up.

705
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:10,872
Look at you lying around doing nothing.

706
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,333
What now? Should I take a picture of you?
Should I? Huh?

707
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,210
-Are you here to have fun?
-EOMJI: I'm sorry.

708
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,796
We have a lot to do.
Go find things to do, for God's sake.

709
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,088
(moans)

710
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,298
(sighs)

711
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:25,053
-You're being so silly.
-How do I look? Do I look like Oh Jiyoung?

712
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,763
-Do I?
-No.

713
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,600
Stop talking about Oh Jiyoung.
Just do your work, for God's sake.

714
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,143
SANGGOO: Please carry this. Man.

715
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,394
(grunting)
Here.

716
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,396
My stomach hurts.
That's why. Come and help me.

717
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:38,733
Don't forget to take this.

718
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:39,859
(grunts)

719
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,945
(upbeat music)

720
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,824
YESOOL: Wait a second, please!

721
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,499
(Minhee gasps)

722
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,459
Damn it!

723
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,294
Why are you still here?

724
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,088
Oh, you dropped all of them.

725
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,589
One, two, three.

726
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,216
Goodness.

727
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,425
One, two, three.

728
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:05,593
We need to spread this.

729
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,512
One, two, three.

730
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,974
You're so annoying.

731
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,476
Guys. What is all this?
Put the shoes on the shoe rack.

732
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,686
Do it properly.

733
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,938
Is this supposed to be empty?

734
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,026
Here.

735
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,528
(grunts)

736
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,616
Hang in there, everyone.
We're almost done.

737
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,243
-Good work.
-Yes, ma'am.

738
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,212
Mr. Cha.

739
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,256
Yes, I'm on my way.

740
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,674
(laughing)
Yes.

741
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,967
Yes, sir.

742
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,220
(scoffs)

743
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,348
-YESOOL: Thank you.
-SANGGOO: Thank you.

744
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:53,474
-MINHEE: Thank you.
-ROMA: Thank you for your hard work.

745
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:54,475
Thank you for your hard work. Bye.
Have a glass of makgeolli tonight.

746
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,560
Bye.

747
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,853
-Thank you.
-Take care.

748
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,147
-Oh, man.
-Oh, I'm so exhausted.

749
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,232
Boy, that was a lot of work.
It almost killed me.

750
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,359
-EOMJI: It did?
-(Sanggoo laughs)

751
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,485
Oh, man.
(sighs)

752
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,530
(all sigh)

753
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,365
-Eomji.
-Okay.

754
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,285
All right. Let's see.
Let's see. Let's see.

755
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,120
-SANGGOO: Yes.
-(exhales deeply)

756
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,875
-ROMA: Oh.
-(Minhee exclaims)

757
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,835
(Sanggoo laughs)

758
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:21,878
My goodness.

759
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,713
-Come and take a look at it.
-(all cheer)

760
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,965
-Wow!
-(cheering continues)

761
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:29,302
-Good job, everyone!
-Yeah!

762
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,721
It's so cool. It's crazy.

763
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,556
(laughs)

764
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,601
Shall we get ready to go home?

765
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,102
Go home? Huh? Go...

766
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,771
-See you tomorrow!
-See you tomorrow!

767
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,106
(Sanggoo laughs)

768
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,358
See you!

769
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,657
(light music)

770
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,629
(grunts)

771
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:12,178
FOREST INTO YOUR ROOM,
LIE WITH NATURE, BILLY

772
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,023
If you're not physically strong,
try to do better work.

773
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,487
If you have to stay up for two nights
to finish something,

774
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,239
learn to do it within a day.

775
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,075
You spend 10 hours on things
that you can finish in an hour.

776
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,202
That's why you have to rely
on things like Red Bomb.

777
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:40,415
Everything is ready,
and we won't have any problems, right?

778
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,874
Well, yes.

779
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:46,421
Ms. Oh Jiyoung posted
about our pop-up store event tomorrow.

780
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:50,008
With reporters and her fans,
it's going to be very crowded.

781
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,510
Hmm.

782
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,269
(light music)

783
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,734
Ms. Oh Jiyoung

784
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,736
is really full of enthusiasm.

785
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,324
She even rearranged her schedule
for this event.

786
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,201
She's supporting us a lot.

787
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,662
I think tomorrow's event

788
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,539
will be a great success.

789
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,585
Why didn't you show me
something like this earlier?

790
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,670
Oh.

791
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,921
Well.

792
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,508
That's because of someone
who even turned down my 18th proposal.

793
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,053
What? Your 18th proposal?

794
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,680
(sighs)

795
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,932
I know you always prepare a Plan B.

796
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,351
You prepare 18 or 19 proposals

797
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,312
and make decisions
based on my responses, right?

798
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,148
Just try to come up with one good one.

799
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,483
Like

800
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,110
this one.

801
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,449
Oh, by the way...

802
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:58,701
"With Billy."

803
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,953
That slogan is pretty lame.

804
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,706
Spend more time on slogans next time.

805
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,590
Yes!

806
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,510
Nice! Nice!
(chuckles)

807
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,221
(light music)

808
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,861
His cellphone is turned off.

809
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,321
His girlfriend can't get a hold
of him either.

810
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,405
SEUNGTAEK: What about his parents' house?

811
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,658
He was... He was there last time.
Where was it?

812
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:39,992
Yes, Samcheok, Gangwon-do.

813
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,787
I called his parents too.
But he wasn't there.

814
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,455
That punk. Did he go clubbing again?

815
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,250
Sir. He's completely hopeless.

816
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,584
This isn't his first time.

817
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,003
It's better that I work extra hours
to replace him.

818
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,922
His presence wouldn't be of any help.

819
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,550
-Hey, dude. You're his colleague, friend.
-(moans in pain)

820
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,969
-And teammate. How can you say that?
-Ouch, it hurts. It hurts. It hurts.

821
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,138
Oh! That's Oh Jiyoung!

822
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,308
-(quirky music)
-PATIENT: Oh, my goodness.

823
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,810
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

824
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,062
-(sighs)
-PATIENT: Oh Jiyoung.

825
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,106
-She's really pretty.
-She's pretty.

826
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,649
She's so pretty.

827
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,116
(chuckles awkwardly)
Hi.

828
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,660
(sighs)

829
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,620
(moans in fatigue)

830
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,041
Oh, I feel so dizzy.

831
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,214
You look like...

832
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,218
(sighing)
...Hyun Bin, Doctor.

833
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,470
You should eat well.

834
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,806
Have high-protein foods
and three meals a day regularly.

835
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,226
-Don't skip meals.
-I have a photoshoot tomorrow.

836
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,771
If my face gets puffy like a full moon,
will you take responsibility for that?

837
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,398
I can't take responsibility for that.

838
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:55,109
But have faith
in the Korean editors' Photoshop skills.

839
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,737
I haven't eaten anything yet,
so I'm very sensitive now.

840
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:01,324
Stop talking back to me
because it gets on my nerves.

841
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,867
Talking back to...
(sighs)

842
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,494
What brings you here?

843
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,538
(sighs)

844
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,123
(breathes roughly in frustration)

845
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,750
Are you really not going to tell me?

846
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,919
-Tell you what? What? What?
-For God's sake.

847
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,837
Hey, take off those
weird-looking shoes with pointed toes!

848
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,631
Stop pretending not to know
what I'm asking you!

849
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,090
The girl who kissed Minhu.

850
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:19,508
You must know her!

851
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,886
Go ask that punk yourself.
Why are you asking me that?

852
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,179
I'm tied up today.

853
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,182
Hey, if you keep coming to me like this,

854
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:29,227
I'm going to tell Doctor Oh
about everything. Got it?

855
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:30,603
For goodness' sake.

856
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,605
Now listen to me.

857
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,732
Get out. Get out right now.

858
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,526
(moans)
Oh, my head really aches.

859
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,819
I said, get out.

860
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:39,737
My head hurts.

861
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,448
My next patient will be here soon.
Get out now, for God's sake.

862
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,492
Get out! Are you going to stay here?

863
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,620
Oh, come on. Get out of my office,
for God's sake.

864
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,207
-I'm going to come back tomorrow.
-Don't!

865
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,251
-I will.
-Don't!

866
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,002
-Please don't ever come here again.
-(sighs)

867
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,630
OH SEUNGTAEK CELLPHONE

868
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:01,425
SEUNGTAEK (on phone): Hey, hey, hey.
Oh Jiyoung is driving me crazy.

869
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,970
Please tell her
to stop coming to my office.

870
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,555
I told you.
This is why you shouldn't have told her.

871
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,724
You reap what you sow.

872
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,851
Hey, I was just talking to Doctor Oh,
and she overheard us.

873
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,853
I feel like I'm wrongly accused.

874
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,897
-MINHU (on phone): Hey. By the way,...
-(sighs)

875
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,275
I think the pills I took before
are better than what I'm taking now.

876
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:18,985
-Please get me more of those.
-SEUNGTAEK: (on phone) Oh, really?

877
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,488
By the way, shouldn't
the symptoms be gone by now?

878
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,283
(sighs)
It still hurts a little,

879
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,617
but it's bearable.

880
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:27,660
(Seungtaek sighs)

881
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,870
No wonder. You take a lot of pills.

882
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,416
Because of that pop-up thing,
you're taking twice as many now.

883
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,417
SEUNGTAEK (on phone):
Will you be okay with that?

884
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,210
Bring them over when you have time.
I've got to go.

885
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,671
Hey, hey!

886
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,047
Jeez, this punk.

887
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,801
(whooshing)

888
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,516
(upbeat music)

889
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,771
-Hello.
-Welcome, everyone.

890
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,023
Welcome.

891
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,192
Oh, man. Oh, man.
Oh, I can take a picture of you.

892
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,527
Okay.

893
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,071
Sure, you can sit on it.

894
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,156
All right.

895
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,199
Okay. Billy.

896
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,036
I'd appreciate it if you could share
the picture on your social media accounts.

897
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,330
If you share the picture
on your social media accounts,

898
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,999
we'll give you "Teatime with Oh Jiyoung"
as a gift.

899
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,625
EOMJI: One, two, three.

900
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:18,961
SANGGOO: Lie with nature. Billy.

901
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,088
You can go in and look around.

902
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,591
One, two, three.

903
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,426
One, two, three.

904
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,638
The picture came out really well.

905
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,432
Hi.

906
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,061
(upbeat music)

907
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,902
It's very soft, isn't it?
You can try lying down.

908
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,195
(laughs)

909
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,493
NEW POST
HAVING A GOOD TIME AT BILLY POP-UP STORE

910
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,912
Oh, just a second.

911
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,749
BILLY POP-UP STORE

912
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,877
I'M HERE AT BILLY POP-UP STORE

913
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:06,842
What's that?

914
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,678
-(gasps)
-Awesome.

915
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,055
(Eomji groans)

916
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,473
It's a success.

917
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,143
(giggling)
It's a complete success.

918
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,728
I know.

919
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:21,774
Jiyoung. Do you know how much
I was harassed by the director

920
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,859
when I asked him to change
your shooting schedule?

921
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,152
It's because of him, right?

922
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,530
You usually don't accept changes
if you're not given notice.

923
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,032
But you remember the shoot
on that rainy day? Huh?

924
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,992
They changed the concept
of the commercial because of the rain.

925
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,120
But you didn't complain about it.
Today too.

926
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,621
It's because of Cha Minhu, right?

927
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,541
How disrespectful.

928
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,751
(sighs)

929
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,462
He's not a friend of yours.
(tuts)

930
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,424
(sighs)

931
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,719
It smells?

932
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,349
I don't smell anything.

933
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,476
Call the janitor's office and ask them
to turn on the air-conditioners.

934
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,979
And get some air freshener and spray it
before we get more customers.

935
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:01,564
Air freshener?

936
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,065
Keep your distance.

937
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,525
I can still hear you.

938
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,068
-Do it right now.
-Oh.

939
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,319
Okay.

940
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,864
(indistinct chatter)

941
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,750
Chief.

942
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:23,502
Yes?

943
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,882
The left supporting stand
seems to be unstable.

944
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,425
And the floor seems to be slippery.

945
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,177
Please check them.

946
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,721
Well...

947
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,435
Why does he keep asking me to check
the stuff? For goodness' sake.

948
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:42,938
Oh!

949
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:45,357
(sniffs)

950
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,485
(coughs)
I don't smell anything.

951
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:48,944
He says he does.

952
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:54,116
He's so sensitive. It must be so hard
for him to live in this world.

953
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,576
He's not just sensitive.

954
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,995
It's not like I'm some kind of insect.
What's wrong with him?

955
00:49:58,621 --> 00:49:59,830
You know what?

956
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,291
I think

957
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,877
he has slightly changed.

958
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,379
Since that day.
You know, the day of the shoot.

959
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,757
No, he's always been like that.

960
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,093
He's just a cranky and sensitive person.

961
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:15,012
Whatever we do, it never satisfies him.

962
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,014
He just relieves his stress
by intimidating...

963
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,474
That's pretty harsh.

964
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,144
(scoffs)

965
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,730
Oh, that's Oh Jiyoung!

966
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,233
-(crowd clamoring)
-CUSTOMER: Huh? Oh Jiyoung?

967
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:28,609
-MANAGER: Excuse me.
-HAIRSTYLIST: Excuse me.

968
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,277
-It's Oh Jiyoung, right?
-(crowd clamoring)

969
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:31,987
Please line up if you want to get
her autograph.

970
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:34,532
-ROMA: Please line up right here.
-CUSTOMER: Please take a picture with me!

971
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,450
-ROMA: This way, please!
-Please look at me!

972
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,993
-(crowd clamoring)
-I'm a big fan of yours! Here. Here.

973
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,037
-She's so pretty!
-I'm a real fan of yours! Seriously!

974
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,748
-Please tell all your friends about Billy.
-(clamoring)

975
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:43,958
Here!

976
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,461
-EOMJI: Wow, she's a great help to us.
-CUSTOMER: Wow, you're so pretty!

977
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,964
-(crowd clamoring)
-(camera shutter clicks)

978
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,934
She must've heard everything, right?

979
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,437
Yeah, she definitely did.

980
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:12,987
Do you often bad-mouth
your boss like that?

981
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,282
I really hate people
who smile in front of me

982
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,117
but curse at me behind my back.

983
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,161
Today, I personally

984
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:24,081
went to a police station
and filed suits against those

985
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,625
who left hate comments about me.

986
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,962
Well, I think there's a misunderstanding.

987
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,046
I agree.

988
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,008
Mr. Cha is a bit cranky

989
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,342
and sensitive.

990
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,469
Yes, that's why.

991
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:42,141
Talking behind his back helps me
relieve some stress, so...

992
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,852
But that's one of his charms

993
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,313
and how he could succeed in this field.

994
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,358
And that's what makes him sexy.
Don't you agree?

995
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,860
Exactly.

996
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:56,405
I also think he's sexy
when he's oversensitive.

997
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,781
And that's what I was going to talk about.

998
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,242
I always wondered
why he looked out for you

999
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:02,202
for the past few years.

1000
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,455
(scoffing)
For goodness' sake.

1001
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,081
How could you talk behind his back?

1002
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:09,877
So

1003
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,964
I'd like to drink some coffee.

1004
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,552
I said, coffee.

1005
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,264
Oh, coffee?
(chuckles awkwardly)

1006
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,976
A chocolate cream Frappuccino
with four shots of Frappuccino roast,

1007
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,270
three shots of hazelnut syrup,
five shots of mocha syrup,

1008
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,856
espresso whipped cream,
lots of whole java chips,

1009
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,024
and chocolate drizzle.

1010
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,736
And a caramel Frappuccino
with hazelnut syrup and caramel drizzle.

1011
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,446
Sorry?

1012
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,240
Again.

1013
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:43,827
A chocolate cream Frappuccino
with four shots of Frappuccino roast...

1014
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,997
(pants)

1015
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,960
-Hi, Manager. I'm on my way right now...
-JIYOUNG (on phone): It's me, Oh Jiyoung.

1016
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:54,922
I forgot that I had something
to do after this.

1017
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:58,717
Oh, no. You didn't place
the order already, did you?

1018
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,052
(laughs awkwardly)

1019
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,638
YESOOL (on phone): No, not yet.
I was just standing in line...

1020
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:08,602
Hey, go slowly.

1021
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,729
(sighs)

1022
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,773
Ah.

1023
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,777
(upbeat music)

1024
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,213
Ah.

1025
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,881
For God's sake.

1026
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,262
-(crowd clamoring)
-MAN: I want to sleep here!

1027
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,596
-CUSTOMER: Goodness.
-MAN: I want to sleep here!

1028
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,724
No, you can't sleep here!
Sanggoo. Please help me.

1029
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,642
Leave me alone!

1030
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,018
(gasps)
Yesool!

1031
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,353
(pants)
Look.

1032
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,897
That homeless man wants to sleep there.

1033
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:55,315
He won't leave. What should we do?

1034
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,275
MAN: For God's sake!

1035
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,319
-Sanggoo!
-I'll carry this thing. Let's go.

1036
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,280
This is why he told me to spray
some air freshener.

1037
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,698
-ROMA: For God's sake.
-SANGGOO: Let's go, Roma.

1038
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,450
(grunting)
Please get up. Get up now.

1039
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,368
-SANGGOO: Oh, man.
-YESOOL: Excuse me, sir.

1040
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,121
Why don't you drink this and calm down?

1041
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,205
(moans)

1042
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,791
(all groan)

1043
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,003
Call someone from the janitor's office.

1044
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,713
I'll deal with him. Why don't you go...

1045
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,506
-You need to hurry.
-SANGGOO: Go right now.

1046
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,466
(sighs)

1047
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,342
Oh, no.

1048
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,971
Am I not allowed to sleep here
because I'm homeless?

1049
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:28,098
Let me take a little nap here.

1050
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:32,853
Sir. We paid a fair price
to rent this place.

1051
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,273
If you keep making a scene,
we'll have to call the police.

1052
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,610
I'll give you some money
for a motel or a sauna,

1053
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,861
so please leave.

1054
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,115
-Let go of me!
-(all groan)

1055
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,118
-(crowd clamoring)
-I won't leave. I won't!

1056
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,411
-SANGGOO: Please, for God's sake.
-YESOOL: Sir.

1057
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,330
-I won't leave!
-Wait. Sir.

1058
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,624
Please stop. Please.

1059
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:54,917
(shouts)

1060
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:55,834
-No!
-(shouting continues)

1061
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:58,712
-Please calm down. What do we do?
-No, this is shaking.

1062
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,006
(shouting)
I won't leave!

1063
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,508
(crowd clamoring)

1064
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:03,884
It's shaking.

1065
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,761
No! No! Stop!

1066
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,305
I won't leave!
(shouting)

1067
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,603
(suspenseful music)

1068
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,105
(snaps)

1069
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:26,448
(creaking)

1070
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,749
(all groan)

1071
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,960
-CUSTOMER: Oh, no.
-(moans in pain)

1072
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,336
Mr. Cha!

1073
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,005
-(Minhu moans in pain)
-(gasps)

1074
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,216
Oh, no.

1075
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,468
(moans in pain)

1076
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,595
-YESOOL: Mr. Cha. Are you okay?
-EOMJI: Oh, my goodness!

1077
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,597
Are you okay, Yesool?
What is all this? Are you okay, Mr. Cha?

1078
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,307
-Hey, do something about this.
-What do we do? Mr. Cha.

1079
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,392
-SANGGOO: Mr. Cha!
-(Minhee screams)

1080
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,393
-What do we do?
-What do we do? Call an ambulance.

1081
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,769
-An ambulance. Call an ambulance.
-Call an ambulance!

1082
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:56,853
Does anyone have a cellphone?
Who has one? Please call 911.

1083
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:58,105
-Oh, no. What do we do?
-There you go.

1084
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,148
-No, no. We're fine. We're fine.
-Yesool.

1085
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:02,651
(siren blaring)

1086
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,195
Yes.

1087
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,407
It seems that he's not seriously injured.

1088
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,284
He's getting treatment
in the emergency room.

1089
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,745
Please clean up the pop-up store for me.

1090
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,415
Call our legal team to stop the press
from writing about it.

1091
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,458
Bye.

1092
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,128
(sighs)

1093
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,673
Oh!

1094
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:27,301
What brings you here, Ms. Hong Yesool?

1095
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,885
Oh, are you here to see me?

1096
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:31,805
But you didn't make an appointment
for today.

1097
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,349
Oh. It's not that.

1098
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,059
My boss got hurt, so...

1099
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:38,895
You mean, Cha Minhu?

1100
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,107
Huh? Do you know my boss?

1101
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,902
Wh... Where is he now? Where? Huh?

1102
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,071
Oh, over there.

1103
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:52,492
Here.

1104
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,164
(sighs)

1105
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,416
What happened? Did you faint again?

1106
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,961
You crazy punk.
I told you not to take too many pills.

1107
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,385
YESOOL: I wasn't mistaken.

1108
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,804
Maybe it's really going to happen.

1109
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:14,222
Hey.

1110
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,062
(sighs)

1111
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,939
-How is he, Doctor?
-Sorry?

1112
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,025
Oh, is he your friend?

1113
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,194
Fortunately, his bones are fine.

1114
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,696
But he needs to come for a few days
to replace the dressing.

1115
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:31,782
And I think it'll scar.

1116
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:34,993
Why are you here?

1117
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,663
You're supposed to wrap up the event.
You're the person in charge.

1118
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,041
-What are you staring at?
-What?

1119
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,086
You've been staring at my back
since that day. Why?

1120
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,880
Well, no, no. It's nothing like that.

1121
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,925
Are you okay? You saved me.

1122
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,593
I didn't do that to save you.

1123
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,596
I did it to prevent another accident
at the event. Don't flatter yourself.

1124
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,099
Oh, okay.

1125
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,809
Hey.

1126
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:01,937
(sighs)

1127
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,360
What a coincidence. Unbelievable, right?

1128
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,904
For some reason,
I wanted to take better care of you

1129
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,156
than my other patients. This was why.

1130
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,658
It's a small world, isn't it?

1131
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:18,161
Oh, and that punk is a friend of mine
from high school.

1132
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:20,288
He has a nasty temper,
but he always does a perfect job in

1133
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:22,791
whatever he does,
so please have mercy on him.

1134
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,876
Oh, Ms. Hong Yesool.

1135
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,796
Did you drink Red Bomb today?

1136
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,091
(moans in pain)
Hey.

1137
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,509
Hey, Cha Minhu.

1138
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,010
Where are you going?

1139
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,805
Where are you going in this state? Huh?

1140
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,974
Come here. Come here, dude.

1141
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,393
Give me your car key. Give me the key.

1142
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,519
Give me the key.

1143
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,855
-What do you think you're doing?
-I said, give me the key.

1144
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:46,982
Are you out of your mind?
Trying to drive in this state?

1145
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,567
Anesthesia plus medication. Huh?

1146
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,361
Oh, Yesool.

1147
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,114
You can drive, can't you?

1148
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,907
-Oh. Yes.
-Here.

1149
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:57,451
Forget it. I'll drive myself.

1150
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,079
No. But I can't take you home now.
Should I call Oh Jiyoung over?

1151
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,456
Jesus.

1152
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,043
Then I'll use a chauffeur service.
Call someone for me.

1153
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:10,088
Right here. Chauffeur Hong. Here.

1154
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:13,258
Chauffeur Hong. Please drive him home. Go.
She's your chauffeur. Go.

1155
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,760
Please take care of him, Yesool.

1156
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,013
Come. What are you doing? Come.

1157
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,515
Come. Come on, dude.

1158
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:24,019
All right. Get in the car.
Get in, Cha Minhu.

1159
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,772
-SEUNGTAEK: Bye.
-(Minhu grunts)

1160
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,321
(car horn honking)

1161
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,417
YESOOL: The scar I saw earlier.

1162
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:49,920
I wasn't mistaken.

1163
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:52,756
Keep your eyes on the road.
And drive safely.

1164
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,642
Can you close the window? It's a bit loud.

1165
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,851
Oh.

1166
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,106
(sighs)

1167
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,651
YESOOL: No, no.

1168
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,069
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

1169
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,196
Me and Cha Minhu? That can't be true.

1170
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,406
(whooshing)

1171
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,617
(tires screech)

1172
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,843
What do I do?

1173
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,845
Should I take him back to the hospital?

1174
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,388
(sighs)

1175
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,684
OH SEUNGTAEK
CELLPHONE

1176
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,769
(cell phone vibrates)

1177
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,692
SEUNGTAEK (on phone):
Hey, did you get home safely?

1178
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,444
YESOOL (on phone):
Doctor. It's me, Hong Yesool.

1179
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,698
Oh, hi, Yesool.

1180
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,325
We just arrived at his apartment building.

1181
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,786
But he doesn't look well.

1182
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,664
Should I bring him back to the hospital?

1183
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,000
Oh, no, no.
Please just take him to his place.

1184
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,126
Oh.

1185
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,545
But it'll be harder for him
if you're there.

1186
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,754
Sorry?

1187
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,172
Oh, no. I mean,

1188
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,383
I think it'll be hard for you
to carry him.

1189
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,510
-(Seungtaek laughs awkwardly)
-Oh.

1190
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:22,596
That's no problem.

1191
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,972
Well, just lay him down on the bed

1192
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,807
and give him the medicine
on his nightstand.

1193
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,642
Oh, and his lock code is...

1194
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:29,352
(elevator dings)

1195
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,438
(pants)

1196
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:35,358
(grunts)

1197
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,446
Why is he so heavy?

1198
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,990
(grunting)
Oh, there it is.

1199
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,702
(beeping)

1200
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,667
Shit, I should've just taken him
to the hospital. Shit.

1201
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,544
Oh, Seungtaek, that jerk. I'll kill him.

1202
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:56,880
(grunts)

1203
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:00,342
For God's sake.

1204
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,469
(exhales deeply)

1205
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,720
Man, it's hot.

1206
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,055
(exhales sharply)

1207
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:09,809
(scoffs)

1208
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,394
What is all this?

1209
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:14,481
He told me not to take medicine, but he...

1210
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,737
(sighs)
Water.

1211
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,166
What?

1212
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,211
There's only water in the fridge?
(scoffs)

1213
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:43,343
What's wrong with this place?

1214
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,310
(door keypad beeps)

1215
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,812
(door opens)

1216
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,230
(door closes)

1217
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,984
(light music)

1218
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,404
(rattles)

1219
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:03,822
(shatters)

1220
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,997
(light music)

1221
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,502
(upbeat music)

1222
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:24,778
YESOOL: Am I really sleeping
with that man in this room?

1223
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,280
I can't believe it.

1224
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:38,792
My bag.

1225
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:51,805
YESOOL: Just once.

1226
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,349
I just want to see it one more time.

1227
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,187
(light music)

1228
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,341
(closing theme music)
