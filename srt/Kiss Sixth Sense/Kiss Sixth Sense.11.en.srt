00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,489

00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,010
(suspenseful music continues)

8
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,273
Hi, Sara.

9
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:47,941
I'm almost there.

10
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,777
Yes. Just wait a bit longer.

11
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,446
(tires screech)

12
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,864

00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,105
(light music continues)

19
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,865
Did you sleep well?

20
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,368
Any bad dreams?

21
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,247
BASED ON THE WEB NOVEL
KISS SIXTH SENSE BY GOT W

22
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,170
I love you.

23
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,296
(gasps)

24
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,508

25
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,719
(soft chuckle)

26
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,780

00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,997
(breathes deeply)

28
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,798
HAEJIN:
I told you to get away from Yesool!

29
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:17,757
(Haejin groans)

30
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,051
(dramatic music)

31
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,603
(surprised breath)

32
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,271
Who...

33
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,106
No way...

34
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,859
Is it because of me?

35
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,028
Yesool.

36
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,199
Are you okay? What's wrong?

37
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,869
Come on, open the door.

38
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,871
You're worrying me.

39
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,874
-Hong Yesool.
-(knocking)

40
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,751
Yesool, are you okay?

41
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,420
Hong Yesool!

42
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,052
Did you see something bad
happen in the future?

43
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,887
You can tell me. It's okay.

44
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,183
What is it?

45
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,102
(sighs deeply)

46
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,606
(cell phone vibrates)

47
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,484
HOWOO

48
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,986
YESOOL: A hit-and-run?

49
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,531
Why did Mom not say anything to me?

50
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,699
I don't think it occurred to her
to call anybody,

51
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:25,992
because he's in such bad shape.

52
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,285
I found out about it later too.

53
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,747
Is he okay?

54
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,916
The surgery went well.

55
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,668
He had some internal bleeding
in his organs,

56
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,419
but they stopped all the bleeding.

57
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,880
He'll have to be here
for a few weeks, but he'll be okay.

58
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,383
(machine beeping)

59
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,223
Yesool.

60
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,683
Are you okay?

61
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,643
You must've been really shocked.

62
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,270
You're not looking too well.

63
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,275
Then did they catch the driver?

64
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,694
And where's Mom?

65
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,076
(sighs)

66
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,413
SARA: Did you see the photos I sent?

67
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,789
Yes, Ms. Kim.

68
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,835
He sent those pictures before anybody
even heard of Chulyong's accident.

69
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,004
It has to be him.

70
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,298
I think he's still alive.

71
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,718
I've been looking into it too.
It also seemed a bit off to me.

72
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,845
If what you're saying is true,

73
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,556
then I think it's time to tell Yesool.

74
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,225
Before things get more dangerous,
let's tell her what's going on...

75
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,937
No. I don't want Yesool
to live with such horrible memories.

76
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,772
Minhu.

77
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,526
I still can't sleep without taking
sleeping pills when it rains.

78
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,737
I still remember the day vividly.

79
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,283
If he's still alive,
that changes everything. I'll...

80
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,869
take care of it
so that Yesool doesn't find out.

81
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,413
I've asked a detective
to look into this case.

82
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,958
So please keep everything a secret
until we have a suspect.

83
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,044
All right, then.

84
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,546
I'll meet with the detective
who's on the case too.

85
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,381
Don't worry too much.

86
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,674
Okay.

87
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,760
(dramatic music)

88
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,848
I was just talking with your mother.
You must have been really surprised.

89
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,894
-Why would you and my mom...
-You don't have to come to work today.

90
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,731
I'll call you if anything happens,
so take good care of your mother.

91
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,191
Okay.

92
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,108
MINHU: By the way,

93
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,861
what future did you see earlier
to have scared you so much?

94
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,198
It was...

95
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,867
Never mind.

96
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,745
I'll go to you as soon as I'm done,
so let's talk then.

97
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,121
Don't worry.

98
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,207
Okay.

99
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,544
(light music)

100
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,479
The Mopix ad is supposed to air today.

101
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,190
I can't believe Ms. Hong took a day off.

102
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,858
How could she?

103
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,238
I just called her,
and she said it's a family emergency.

104
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,741
Does it matter?

105
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,869
It's not that busy around this time.
Don't you know that?

106
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,038
Sir.

107
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,373
What's wrong?

108
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,295
Why are you acting so depressed?

109
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,880
What is it?

110
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,465
Did you have a fight

111
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,259
with your wife?

112
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,137
-Sir.
-Tsk, tsk.

113
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,013
(Kyungseok laughs)

114
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,890
EOMJI: Hello.

115
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,603
Well, you all look like you're having fun.

116
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,564
What's up with him?

117
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,650
You know, I've been
wondering about something.

118
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,779
How come something's always
going wrong with Planning Team 1?

119
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,739
What?

120
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,991
You guys shouldn't be
lazing around like this.

121
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,452
Didn't you see the ad
Carnex released today?

122
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,788
KYUNGSEOK:
Jeez. Mopix wouldn't stand for it.

123
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,206
What are you going to do now?

124
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,875
MINHEE: Carnex released their new ad?

125
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,462
Yes. Do you guys even do your job?

126
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,007
You idiots.

127
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,508
(gasps)

128
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,012
Why does it look the same as our draft?

129
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,097
The same as yours?

130
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,641
(quirky music)

131
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,187
This is like our old draft.

132
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,817
So Mopix had already come up
with this draft?

133
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,904
(mutters)
Yes, sir. How did they know about it?

134
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,619
Damn it.

135
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,622
Kang Sanggoo, what's going on?

136
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,915
What do you mean?

137
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,584
You jerk. You know what I mean!

138
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,128
-EOMJI: Oh, my goodness.
-Did you and Cha Minhu plan all this...

139
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,049
I told you to not tell anyone!

140
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,384
How dare you point your finger at me?

141
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,720
(sighs deeply)

142
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,806
Let's not talk about this here.

143
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,433
-Come on.
-EOMJI: No! No, wait.

144
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,768
Hey, let go of me! Let go!

145
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,186
-Wait!
-I told you to let go!

146
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,771
-It's okay.
-Oh, my God.

147
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,815
How dare you do this to me?

148
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,316
Mr. Yeom.

149
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,653
I was just on my way to talk to you.

150
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,490
I saw the new advertisement from Carnex,
and it looked a bit familiar.

151
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,619
I think the draft we were planning to use
went directly to Carnex.

152
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,372
-Is that right?
-Yes, sir.

153
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,084
Why are you talking to me about
your team's security breach?

154
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,755
Every staff member who worked
on the shoot signed an NDA.

155
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,510
So, you must not have heard that
the storyboard Mr. Kang told you about

156
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,638
had already been changed.

157
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,391
Let's not talk about this here.

158
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,351
Why don't we move this somewhere else?

159
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,520
I don't want anybody eavesdropping.

160
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,357
Let's go, Mr. Cha.

161
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,153
Follow us.

162
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,571
What? Follow...

163
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,657
(grunts)

164
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,911
KYUNGSEOK:
Come on, tell me the rest of it.

165
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,830
SANGGOO: There's a couple
who met in their twenties,

166
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,748
loved each other passionately,
then broke up.

167
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,208
Now they're in their seventies.

168
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,585
They run into each other again.

169
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:10,962
And?

170
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,006
What happens next?

171
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,508
Don't tell anybody, okay?

172
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,511
Okay! I told you that
I'm not going to tell anyone!

173
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,514
-SANGGOO: After that...
-KYUNGSEOK: After that?

174
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,474
They stand next to a V9.

175
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,101
So they're doing the V9 now, huh?

176
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,020
It's like they're in a parallel universe.

177
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,397
The two of them are connected.

178
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,441
As if the past is the present,

179
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,568
and the present is the past.

180
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,613
KYUNGSEOK: Okay...

181
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,409
Sir. This is all a big misunderstanding.

182
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,328
The two of us are friends, sir.

183
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,122
We were drinking together,
and we were just joking around.

184
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,416
Hey, isn't that right?

185
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,464
Go ahead, pick up your phone.
It seems important.

186
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,592
Mr. Cha, this isn't the time
to be taking phone calls.

187
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:58,968
Hey, what are you doing?

188
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,345
-Hey, give it back!
-(cell phone vibrates)

189
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,888
CARNEX CHIEF GO SANGGYU

190
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,182
It's from Carnex.

191
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,267
-(soft chuckle)
-Be quiet.

192
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,770
If you have nothing to hide,
accept the call.

193
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,439
Sir? No, this is...

194
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,777
SANGGYU: Hey, Yeom Kyungseok.
Were you trying to screw us over?

195
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,070
You said you were sure!

196
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,864
So why is the storyboard different?

197
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,658
Do you take us for fools?

198
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,328
Forget about getting recruited!

199
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,121
Do you know the position you put me in?

200
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,375
Ever since college,
you've always been a liar and a fraud!

201
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,755
This is all a misunderstanding.
Let me explain this to you

202
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,839
from the very beginning.

203
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,676
-So...
-I think that was Go Sanggyu from Carnex.

204
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,469
You went to college together, didn't you?

205
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,763
And you were trying to get
recruited by Carnex

206
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,099
by giving them the storyboard
for our newest ad?

207
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,684
What are you talking about?

208
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,227
You can discuss the details

209
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,979
with our audit team.

210
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,522
The audit team, sir?

211
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,441
-Who are you?
-Let's go.

212
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,068
Go where? Wait.

213
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,112
Hey, Sanggoo. Sir, wait!

214
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,990
I've worked so hard for Zeu!

215
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,283
Wait, Mr. Cha.

216
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,077
Sanggoo, remember how much money
I gave you when you got married?

217
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,662
(door closes)

218
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,084
That crazy bastard.

219
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,753
He just didn't know when to stop.

220
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,756
I thought he might,
but I was hoping he wouldn't.

221
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,385
Mr. Cha is one scary bastard too.

222
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,181
Don't tell me you're blaming yourself.

223
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,395
Well, this happened because I leaked it.

224
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,772
I feel kind of bad.

225
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,527
That bastard has been planning this
ever since that leak incident.

226
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,697
If this hadn't happened,
things would've gotten worse.

227
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,993
I think Mr. Cha did this
to end things in the safest way.

228
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,244
(exhales deeply)

229
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,829
(chuckles)

230
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,290
Do you have time to be hanging out here?

231
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,501
Isn't the Mopix ad going on air soon?

232
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,087
You're right.

233
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,757
Why did you call me here?

234
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,011
I never called you here.

235
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,264
Let's break things off.
I think that'd be best for everyone...

236
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,390
Do you mean that?

237
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,727
Is this what you really want, huh?

238
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,063
-How much longer is this going to go on?
-I don't know.

239
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,273
Breaking up is the only answer
for us right now.

240
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,108
Are you sure you've got the right channel?

241
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,694
-How much longer until the ad plays?
-It'll be on soon.

242
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,488
-It's almost over.
-You don't know?

243
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,949
Why do you have to break up
so dramatically?

244
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,620
Go ahead and kiss already.
Why are you just staring at each other?

245
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,913
Oh, right.

246
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,873
Mr. Lee, did you hear the news?

247
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,668
I heard that Ms. Oh got dumped by Mr. Cha.

248
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,214
I heard it from the stylist.

249
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,592
Apparently she was crying
and throwing a fit in the car.

250
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,928
I guess that's why she's good
at this kind of acting.

251
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,180
You know she's not that good
of an actress.

252
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,139
(sighs deeply)

253
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,142
Hey, don't talk about someone
you don't know that well.

254
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,685
She didn't get dumped.

255
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,483
It's nothing like that.
They've been friends since they were kids.

256
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,902
Besides, why would she get dumped
by someone like Cha Minhu?

257
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,403
What nonsense.

258
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,824
It's not nonsense.

259
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,034
Oh my.

260
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,702
-PR DIRECTOR: Hello.
-ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Hello.

261
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,622
JIYOUNG: Mr. Lee, why did you lie?

262
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,417
You know that I got dumped.

263
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,087
(sighs)
What are you talking about?

264
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,881
Were you trying to cover for me?

265
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,092
Amazing.

266
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,260
(exhales deeply)

267
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,303
Why? Why would you do that for me?

268
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,806
Since when have you been so nice to me?

269
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,558
I wasn't being nice.

270
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,686
I just didn't want our staff
to come up with weird rumors.

271
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,565
Then why are you so flustered?

272
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,859
Look at you and your serious face.

273
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,112
I didn't put on a serious face.

274
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,448
Why do you keep coming here, Ms. Oh?

275
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,826
I wanted to watch
the first-ever advertisement

276
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,828
that our newbie commercial director made.

277
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,415
And if it sucks,
I want to tell you right to your face.

278
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,375
Is that so?

279
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,751
(soft chuckle)

280
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,754
Oh. I'm coming on!

281
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,216
JIYOUNG: Race through life together.

282
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,225
Yesterday and today,
you're always by my side.

283
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,442
Connecting the past and present.

284
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,703
Thanks, Mopix.

285
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,748
That's cold!

286
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,960
Back then, and right now,

287
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,879
I'm still...

288
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,505
with you.

289
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,549
That looks so good.

290
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:49,717
(Howoo gasps)

291
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,886
Yesool, you worked so hard.

292
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,264
I bet Uncle in heaven is elated too.

293
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,266
Yes.

294
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,060
Yesool.

295
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,020
He's going to be all right.

296
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,688
Is this reminding you of your father?

297
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,941
Don't worry, Yesool.

298
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,151
I'll take good care of him
as I'm doing my rounds.

299
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,320
I know he's important to you and Howoo.

300
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,447
So just leave it to me!

301
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,157
Thank you, doctor.

302
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,410
You know, Pilyo is a really good director.

303
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,704
Are you sure this is his first time
doing a commercial?

304
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,998
Yes. The visual style is stunning.

305
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,541
Oh Jiyoung looks really pretty too.

306
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,046
Of course. It's Oh Jiyoung.
Of course, she looks pretty.

307
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,758
But it's so weird. Why are you looking
at her when it's a car ad?

308
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,136
Oh, I just meant that she looks
a lot prettier than she does in real life.

309
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,140
So you're saying that Oh Jiyoung
is really, really freaking pretty. Right?

310
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,102
I need to get going.
You two can continue your conversation.

311
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,312
What? Yesool.

312
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,858
Don't you have a job to do?

313
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,610
Why do you keep following me around?

314
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:53,155
Hey, I'm following you
because you won't talk to me.

315
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,116
Have you eaten yet?

316
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,660
Go eat with Oh Jiyoung.

317
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,370
Geez.

318
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,664
(quirky music)

319
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,040
(smirks)

320
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,546
(light music)

321
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,261
(Haejin grunts)

322
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,638
(breathes deeply)

323
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,523
(ominous music)

324
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,067
HAEJIN: Hong Yesool.

325
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,778
Yesool.

326
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,656
Yesool.

327
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,243
I called your name so many times.

328
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,912
Haejin, what are you doing here?

329
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,124
I'm visiting a friend.
I'm just dropping by. You?

330
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,208
Uh...

331
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,378
Someone I know got into a car accident.

332
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,381
Hey, why haven't you been
coming by lately?

333
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,844
I've been really busy.
I'll visit when things settle down.

334
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:57,970
Okay.

335
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,807
I came up with a new dish,
so you need to taste it for me.

336
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,934
Bye, then.

337
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,311
Bye.

338
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,952
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

339
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,169
YOU MAKE ME
WAITED LONG?

340
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,421
I MISS YOU, I'LL BE WAITING

341
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,715
(suspicious music)

342
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,260
NO CALLER ID

343
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,555
(cell phone vibrates)

344
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,479
Hello?

345
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,356
HAEJIN: Are you still with that man?

346
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,983
Kim Haejin.

347
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,569
You're Kim Haejin, aren't you?

348
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,240
I knew you'd remember me.

349
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,158
Did you do this?

350
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,119
Did you do this to Chulyong?

351
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,412
Yes.

352
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,039
I can't allow you to be with another man.

353
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,958
So, can't you just...

354
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,001
come to me yourself?

355
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,461
You're insane!

356
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,089
Do you still have that horrible illness?

357
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,342
I told the police everything.
You won't get what you want this time.

358
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,510
Really?

359
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,555
What a shame. That was your last chance.

360
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,265
What?

361
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,642
We'll all meet soon. You and me.

362
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,728
And our daughter, Yesool.

363
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,896
Yesool isn't your daughter.

364
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,732
If you touch my daughter,

365
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:33,983
I will kill you!

366
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,777
Hello? Hello!

367
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,738
Kim Haejin!

368
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,823
(foreboding music)

369
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,835
Mom. What's wrong?

370
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,504
Who was that?

371
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,798
Yesool...

372
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,637
He's a friend from college.

373
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,057
We're on bad terms because
of something that happened years ago.

374
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,268
I think that's why he did all this.

375
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,270
Regardless of his animosity toward you,

376
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,273
what he did was attempted murder.

377
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,193
Then, is he the person

378
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,361
who broke into my house
and took Dad's picture?

379
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,783
I've told the police everything I know,
so he'll be caught soon.

380
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,701
So don't you worry.

381
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,953
How can I not worry?

382
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,582
If you knew who it was,
you should've told me!

383
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,043
You could be in danger too!

384
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,420
I'll be fine. I'm not going to
leave the hospital.

385
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,173
There are so many people here.
He won't be able to do anything.

386
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,511
You should stay at Minhu's place
for a while.

387
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,305
I've sent some of
your stuff there already.

388
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,183
-What?
-Yesool.

389
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,185
Listen to me.

390
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,106
Mom!

391
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,819
(sighs)

392
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,622
Where are you going?
Your mother said you should stay...

393
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,165
Mr. Cha.

394
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,251
I think I need to put
some distance between us.

395
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,379
I think you could be in danger

396
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,464
because of me.

397
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,635
Apparently, there's someone
who wants to hurt my family.

398
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,471
He's the one who did this to Chulyong.

399
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,433
I think he'll target me next,
and you'll get hurt in the process.

400
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,022
What do I do, Mr. Cha?

401
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,276
I might misunderstand
the context of the future I see,

402
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,403
but it always comes true.

403
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:48,117
If what I saw is right, then
you're going to try to save me and...

404
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,202
(breathes deeply)

405
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:56,333
Well, if something dangerous happens
to me, like you said,

406
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,504
you should tell me exactly
what happens to me on that day.

407
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,550
It's okay. Just tell me
the rest of what you saw.

408
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,177
Where do you think it takes place?

409
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,018
It was in a forest.

410
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,939
YESOOL: It was late at night.

411
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,359
There's a frozen pond right next to you.

412
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,821
And? What else?

413
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,868
A blood moon.

414
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:32,786
A blood moon?

415
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,458
YESOOL: There's a blood moon in the sky,
and there's some weird light around it.

416
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,668
What's this?

417
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,922
And, nearby,

418
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,258
there are some banners about an event.

419
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,511
NOEL ORPHANAGE

420
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,305
It says "Noel."

421
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,140
Noel?

422
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,400
Is this the place?

423
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,945
NOEL ORPHANAGE TO COMMEMORATE OPENING

424
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,655
I think I know where it is.

425
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,032
What?

426
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,409
They always hold a ceremony
around this time of year.

427
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,663
There's a reservoir nearby.
I think that's the place you saw.

428
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,208
But how do you know this place?

429
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,251
It's where I go on the third Saturday
of every month.

430
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,630
If you know about this place,

431
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,633
it must mean that
the future I saw will really happen.

432
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,096
But why do we even go there?

433
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,681
(breathes rapidly)

434
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,142
I don't know.

435
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,522
I don't know what's going to happen,
or how I can stop it.

436
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,357
Why do we...

437
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,693
(breathes rapidly)

438
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:46,944
This won't do.

439
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,154
I really think
I should stay away from you.

440
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,157
Yesool, it's okay. I'm not going to die.

441
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,743
It's an event that happens every year.

442
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,537
And I'm pretty sure
we still have some time,

443
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,622
so let me look for a solution before then.

444
00:24:58,956 --> 00:24:59,999
Don't you trust me?

445
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,878
It'll be okay. Nothing is going to happen.

446
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,172
(dramatic music)

447
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,971
(sobbing)

448
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,103
(dramatic music continues)

449
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,748
MINHU: Sir, it's me, Minhu.

450
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,041
Hi, Minhu.

451
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,792
I have a question.

452
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,128
What is it?

453
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,173
Are you going to commemorate the opening
of the orphanage this year too?

454
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,008
Of course.

455
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,760
What's the date for it?

456
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,512
It'll be on December 31st.

457
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,514
Why, are you going to come?

458
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,438
(foreboding music)

459
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,738
NOEL ORPHANAGE

460
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,616
(strained grunt)

461
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,369
(siren blaring)

462
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,455
(Young Yesool laughs)

463
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,085
No.

464
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,003
(bubbling)

465
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,548
(ominous music)

466
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,261
No!

467
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,931
-MINHU: What is it?
-(exhales deeply)

468
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,600
-Did you have a bad dream?
-What is this?

469
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:45,062
I think it's the reservoir
I saw in the future.

470
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,523
The reservoir? What about it?

471
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,026
Did I see the future instead of a dream?

472
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,070
No.

473
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,947
That's me when I was younger.

474
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,490
What did you dream about?

475
00:26:56,573 --> 00:27:00,452
I was getting chased by someone,
and I fell into the reservoir.

476
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,830
And someone rescued me.

477
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:07,376
Do you think this has something to do
with the memories I've lost?

478
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,629
I don't know what's going on.

479
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,091
(sighs)

480
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:21,348
It's okay. It was just a dream.

481
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,433
(breathes deeply)

482
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,574
GANAM RESERVOIR

483
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,289
NOEL ORPHANAGE

484
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,375
(suspicious music)

485
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,259
JEONIN SHOPPING CENTER

486
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,477
(light music)

487
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,022
The screen isn't in a great location.

488
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,273
Are you sure it'll be fine?

489
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,650
The advertisement was a real hit,

490
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,653
so they're expecting a lot from
the additional advertisements as well.

491
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,407
I don't think you need to worry, sir.

492
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,868
Lots of people pass this area
when going to and from work,

493
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,661
so I think this is the best place

494
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,830
for the ad to be seen by your customers.

495
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,916
Well, this building
is going to be demolished,

496
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,834
but I think the ad
will reach even more people

497
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:33,211
because the press will be
talking about it.

498
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,880
Right, Ms. Hong?

499
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,549
Who came up with that idea?

500
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,344
This is a special place for Ms. Hong.

501
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,762
(laughs)

502
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,347
Ms. Hong.

503
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,390
Yes, sir.

504
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,560
This place holds a lot
of special memories for me,

505
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,520
but it's also a building that has housed

506
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,649
banks, post offices, and wedding halls
for over 30 years.

507
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,486
In that way, it's also special
for the people who live here.

508
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,737
Just like Mopix.

509
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,697
All right.

510
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,200
You've done a good job
of incorporating that story

511
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,493
into the advertising strategy.

512
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,454
If you use this place
to advertise your product,

513
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:11,208
I think it will be very meaningful
since this place is going to be renovated

514
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,918
after being with us for such a long time.

515
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:16,880
I'm looking forward to it.

516
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,220
SANGGOO:
Measure it precisely from end to end.

517
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,388
ROMA: Yes, sir.

518
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,766
SANGGOO: What's wrong, Ms. Hong?

519
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,893
You've been acting off lately.

520
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,479
Is that family emergency
something really serious?

521
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,773
No. It's nothing.

522
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,733
Don't give me that.

523
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,736
Wait, that lower part... Oops.

524
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,990
(whimsical music)

525
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:45,575
(Sanggoo groans)

526
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,661
Oh, come on.

527
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,705
ROMA: Are you okay? Come on, get up.

528
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,960
Are you okay?

529
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,795
What do you mean, the lower part?

530
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,922
Over there, at the end!

531
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,882
Why can't you understand
simple directions?

532
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:02,968
Sir!

533
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,179
Watch out.

534
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,224
-Thank you.
-So...

535
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,684
(pained groan)

536
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,060
ROMA: Come on, get up.

537
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,354
Where's your lower body strength?

538
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,356
(Sanggoo groans)

539
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,901
-YESOOL: The future doesn't change.
-ROMA: Come on. Get up.

540
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,155
I think the driver was following you,

541
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,741
and when he thought
it was the right place and time,

542
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,242
he hit you with his car.

543
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,787
Do you remember
where and when it happened?

544
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,833
I usually take a walk around
the same place every evening,

545
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,669
but I don't know for sure.

546
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,300
A walk?

547
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,344
(sighs)

548
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,934
Do you mind if I take a look at this, sir?

549
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,396
Go ahead.

550
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,067
(suspenseful music)

551
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,202
SITE OF ACCIDENT

552
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,080
(sighs)

553
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,251
BLOOMING BEAUTIFULLY

554
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,339
(foreboding music)

555
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,519
(camera shutter clicks)

556
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,533
(foreboding music continues)

557
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,302
Here's proof that the hit-and-run
was intentional and premeditated.

558
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,390
Also, the thief who broke
into Ms. Hong's house

559
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,852
and the murderer
of the cold murder case, 2000-624,

560
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,478
could be the same person.

561
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,356
(sighs)
How on earth am I supposed to know

562
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,484
that it was the same person
just by looking at this?

563
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,530
You need to reinterrogate
the perpetrator you caught

564
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,906
and launch a new investigation.

565
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,075
How am I supposed to do that
at this point?

566
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,204
You need to catch him
before December 31st!

567
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,374
If you do nothing even after
I've given you all this evidence,

568
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,418
I'll file a complaint
and go to the press about it!

569
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,920
Where did you say the first location was?

570
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,089
If you look here...

571
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,428
I'm Detective Yang Ginam
with Jungdaemun Police.

572
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,598
-I see.
-I'm here to investigate the hit-and-run

573
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,433
at the nearby park a few days ago.

574
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,311
I need to check the CCTV footage
from November 27th.

575
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,521
Yes.

576
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,524
I'm investigating
the hit-and-run that happened

577
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:07,527
a few days ago at the nearby park
on November 27th.

578
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,697
Thank you.

579
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,450
Could we check the footage
from November 27th?

580
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,245
(suspenseful music)

581
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,147
(suspenseful music continues)

582
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,575
It's the same guy. Please make sure
the investigation goes quickly.

583
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,576
All right.

584
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,453
What are you writing? Come on.

585
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:05,877
(car door opens)

586
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,089
(car door closes)

587
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,342
Jiyoung, Director Lee just passed by.

588
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,510
Really?

589
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,179
DIRECTOR LEE PILYO

590
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,598
(cell phone vibrates)

591
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,141
OH JIYOUNG

592
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,604
(sighs deeply)

593
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,945
What? You're going to ignore me now?

594
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,780
Dang it, Lee Pilyo.

595
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,699
Where did he go?

596
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,159
He went into the building right out front.

597
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,037
(light music)

598
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,539
(sighs deeply)

599
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,048
Why didn't you pick up my call?
You didn't answer yesterday, either.

600
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,509
I thought you were busy.
But it was on purpose, then?

601
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,761
How did you even know about this place?

602
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,180
I have you in the palm of my hand.

603
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,265
Jeez.

604
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,519
But, what are you doing
in a run-down place like this?

605
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,604
(Jiyoung sighs)

606
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,272
Really, Mr. Lee.

607
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,108
I don't know how you manage to
find these places all the time.

608
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,360
It'll be the last time.

609
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,447
After the Mopix advertisement
is displayed here,

610
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,032
it'll be demolished soon after.

611
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,660
I'm also going to leave the country soon.

612
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,456
Really?

613
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,751
I have no reason to stay.

614
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,086
Damn it.

615
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,880
I'm here!

616
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,760
Why would you leave me too?
How am I supposed to live, then?

617
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,055
(quirky music)

618
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,475
I mean...

619
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,270
I just don't want to lose
a drinking buddy.

620
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,607
No. Never mind. It's nothing. I...

621
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:54,027
I just thought I might miss
how you talk crap about me.

622
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,820
That's not it.

623
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,656
Wait, no.

624
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:01,451
I really liked the synopsis
of your next movie.

625
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,704
I'm thinking about taking the role.

626
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,748
No.

627
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,126
You know, you're a total lightweight.

628
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,254
I feel like I should take care of you
until you can finish a bottle of soju.

629
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,506
Something like that.

630
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,343
Let's go for some drinks
for the last time, then.

631
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,347
Wait.

632
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,684
Mr. Lee, you know what I meant, right?

633
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,271
Are you really going to the UK, though?

634
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,982
I thought that I got
a lot better at drinking.

635
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,410
Flexible sheet, LED, or dimensional signs.

636
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,704
The vibe will change
depending on which type we use.

637
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:49,416
So I think we need to check
if it matches the color

638
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,459
of the outside of the building
and the design.

639
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,794
All right, thank you.

640
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,796
Oh, and it's going to look different

641
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,924
depending on the time of day
and the placement of the lights,

642
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,343
so make sure to keep that in mind as well.

643
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,344
Yes, sir.

644
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:04,305
(breathes deeply)

645
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,391
(mellow music)

646
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,191
Paju, Gyeonggi-do, yeah? Paju.

647
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,861
Why do you keep looking at me?
You keep taking glances at me.

648
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,533
Come on, stop that.

649
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,869
Let's go on a date after work.

650
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,871
(light music)

651
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,507
This looks so good.

652
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,761
Finally, a proper date.

653
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,637
-Yes.
-I'm not saying that our dates

654
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,055
-have been bad.
-Really?

655
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,391
Let's do this every day from now on.

656
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,143
Okay?

657
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,190
This is great.

658
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,486
(light music)

659
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,616
Let me see.

660
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,623
-It's so pretty.
-(both chuckle)

661
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,180
(light music)

662
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,880
This song is great.

663
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,037
YESOOL: Hmm.

664
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,873
-This is so nice.
-Yes.

665
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,083
I wish every day were like today.

666
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,256
(light music)

667
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,695
(mellow music)

668
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,534
One, two, three.

669
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:14,787
One, two, three.

670
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,206
One, two, three.

671
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,291
(camera shutter clicks)

672
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,375
(laughs)

673
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,463
(mellow music)

674
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,848
(machine beeping)

675
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,483
(sobbing)

676
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,707
(sobbing continues)

677
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,773
(dramatic music)

678
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,781
Yesool.

679
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,542
Hong Yesool.

680
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:06,774
YESOOL: Mr. Cha.

681
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:10,278
I'm sorry I'm only leaving
this note behind.

682
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,447
The only thing I can do

683
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,283
is try to change the future.

684
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,162
I'll be staying in the States
until the end of winter.

685
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,373
Nothing will happen if we're not together.

686
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,751
Don't worry.

687
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,544
I'll call you.

688
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,635
(dramatic music)

689
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,112
-Have you left already?
-Yes.

690
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,198
I'll be staying at your brother's place.

691
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,325
I got the earliest ticket possible.

692
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,243
I'm on my way to the airport now.

693
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,537
You've talked to Minhu about this, right?

694
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:02,830
Yes.

695
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,166
I'll call him when I get there.

696
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,877
SARA: Okay. I'll feel a lot better
if you're there.

697
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,379
I'll go there too
once Mr. Kim is feeling better.

698
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,547
Okay.

699
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:16,302
Mom, the taxi driver is calling me.
I'll call you back.

700
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,353
Hello.

701
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,855
It might be hard for you to find me here.

702
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,315
I'll find a bigger road.

703
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,525
Okay.

704
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,113
(suspenseful music)

705
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,758
What is this?
(breathes rapidly)

706
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,973
(suspenseful music continues)

707
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:22,910
(exhales deeply)

708
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,216
(clatters)

709
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,360
(foreboding music)

710
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,718
(Yesool panting)

711
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,180
Haejin!

712
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,183
Haejin! Haejin!

713
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,309
Haejin!

714
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,852
Haejin!

715
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,648
(gasps)

716
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,326
Hey, where's the fire?
What's all that stuff you've got with you?

717
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,665
It's a long story.
I'm going to the States for a bit.

718
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,416
The States?

719
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:55,711
Yes.

720
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,839
I can't tell you the details,

721
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,926
-but it'll only be for a bit.
-Ah...

722
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:06,639
Is it because your mother's
new boyfriend's hit-and-run scared you?

723
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:08,849
Yes.

724
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,685
By the way,

725
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,104
how did you know about that?

726
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,190
Right?

727
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,734
How did I know about that?

728
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,323
(ominous music)

729
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,551
(ominous music continues)

730
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:58,733
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Please try calling again later.

731
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,027
(panting)

732
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,282
(foreboding music)

733
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,169
(thudding)

734
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,427
(foreboding music continues)

735
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,268
(tires screech)

736
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,274
("You Make Me" playing)

737
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,148
(exhales deeply)

738
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,738
("You Make Me" playing continues)

739
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,339
Haejin.

740
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,050
What are you doing...

741
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,760
Haejin?

742
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,263
Call me Dad.

743
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,184
I think it's about time
that you did, don't you think?

744
00:48:57,977 --> 00:48:59,061
What?

745
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:01,355
I'm cooking up one of your favorites.

746
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,818
I wanted your mother to be here too.

747
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,654
But your mom has never listened to me.

748
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,406
She'll be here soon, though.

749
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:14,201
I know how to get her to do what I want.

750
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,204
My daughter. First,

751
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:18,998
have a cup of coffee.

752
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,503
(breathes rapidly)

753
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,591
MINHU: The 31st... Noel.

754
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,218
Could it be...

755
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,554
(whooshing)

756
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,849
What are you talking about?

757
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:40,811
Since you don't remember anything,
let me explain everything to you.

758
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:44,440
I'll explain how we became a family,
and why we were torn apart.

759
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,735
I'll tell you all about it.

760
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,280
(suspenseful music)

761
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,704
Hi.

762
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:11,467
HAEJIN: I loved Sara
ever since I first met her.

763
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,596
The two of us were so happy.

764
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:24,855
Until Sungjoon,

765
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,274
that bastard appeared.

766
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,275
YOUNG YESOOL: Dad!

767
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,111
Yesool.

768
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,996
Dad!

769
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:45,167
-Dad.
-Where have you been, Yesool?

770
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,877
Where did you play today?

771
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,755
HAEJIN: That bastard ruined everything.

772
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,675
-He ended up...
-Where did you go off to today, Yesool?

773
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,426
...taking everything from me

774
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:56,929
including my daughter,

775
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,430
you.

776
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,228
So I had to kill him.

777
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,694
This is the place

778
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,198
where your fake father died.

779
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,201
(foreboding music)

780
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,496
(finger snapping)

781
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,999
(rain pattering)

782
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:32,715
(thunder rumbles)

783
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,776
Hey, you're back.

784
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,778
I thought you'd be late
because of the exhibition.

785
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,997
(foreboding music)

786
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,799
(thunder rumbling)

787
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,890
How did you get in here?

788
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:27,686
Why do you keep doing this?

789
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,481
I could ask you the same thing.
Why do you keep coming to my house?

790
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,815
Hey, Kim Haejin.

791
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:33,651
Please stop this.

792
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,863
Sara and I have explained it to you
so many times.

793
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,367
-But I can only take so much of...
-You!

794
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,329
How do you know my wife?

795
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,416
Snap out of it!

796
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,670
No matter how hard you try,
you can't become me!

797
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,588
So stop it!

798
00:52:55,422 --> 00:53:00,010
Sara and I married each other out of love,
and we even have a daughter.

799
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,847
Your feelings toward Sara

800
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,393
are not real. You're obsessed.

801
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,812
It's a crime!

802
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,856
You've always been like that.

803
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,651
You've always...

804
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,862
taken everything from me.

805
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,991
You even took my daughter from me!

806
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:25,703
"My daughter"?

807
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,081
"My daughter"?

808
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,291
(thunder rumbles)

809
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,334
Why is she yours?

810
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,545
She's not your daughter!

811
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,339
Don't you dare mess with Yesool.

812
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,217
Okay?

813
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,428
Get out.

814
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:46,473
I've heard enough of your rambling.
Now get out.

815
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,641
Come on.

816
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,309
Get out.

817
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,228
I said, leave!

818
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:53,147
(Sungjoon grunts)

819
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,526
(rattles)

820
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,614
I just need you gone.

821
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,199
(strained grunt)

822
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,380
(shatters)

823
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,385
(pained grunt)

824
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,971

825
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,354

(foreboding music)

828
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,715
(Sungjoon's strained grunt)

829
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,305
All of this is mine.
(breathes rapidly)

830
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:13,560
After that, it took me a long time
to get you back.

831
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:18,398
But I waited here
because I thought you might come back.

832
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,026
Then I saw the news article.

833
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,612
The interview you did at Zeu Ad.

834
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,823
Since then, I've been
staying close to you.

835
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,327
Now, call your mother.

836
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,247
It's time for all of us to come together.

837
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:42,756
So, are you saying you're my father?

838
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,593
As you know, I don't remember anything
from when I was young.

839
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,470
I understand.

840
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,681
The shock must have been immense.

841
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:55,102
You must have had a hard time too.

842
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:56,853
All alone.

843
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,443
Do you mind if I take a look around?

844
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:07,030
It's been a while since I've been here.
My room was on the second floor, right?

845
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,240
That's right.

846
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,742
(foreboding music)

847
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,624
(gasps)

848
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,669
Dad's gonna make dinner now.

849
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,964
Okay... Dad.

850
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,554

00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,250

00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,681

855
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:34,701
Yesool.

856
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:38,163
It's time to eat.

857
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,874
(floor creaks)

858
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,962
-HAEJIN: Hong Yesool?
-(panting)

00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,715
(ominous music)

860
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,475
(fingers snap)

861
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,815
Come on, Yesool. Let's eat.

862
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,822

MAN: Really? Is it your first time?

867
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:42,978
Sir.

868
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,564
Hi, Minhu.

869
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,734
How did you know to come here?

870
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,153
I decided to hold the event today.

871
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,404
What?

872
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,072
Wasn't it supposed to be on the 31st?

873
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:57,075
Because some of our sponsors
wouldn't have been able to make it,

874
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,577
we decided to do it today.

875
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:03,039
Anyway, I forgot to call you about it.

876
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,625
NUN: Step back just a little bit.
That's it.

877
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,670
Make sure to stand in a straight line.

878
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,047
A little bit to the side, then step back.

879
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,383
That's it. Good job.

880

Where are you going?

(both pant)

891
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,338

Don't go!

Yesool! Where are you going?

898
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,116
Stop, Yesool! Don't go!
