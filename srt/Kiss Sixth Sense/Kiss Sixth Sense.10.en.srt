00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,818
(light music continues)

00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,921
(theme music)

00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,684
EPISODE 10

5
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,024
(gentle music)

6
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,662
BASED ON THE WEBNOVEL
KISS SIXTH SENSE BY GOT W

7
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,956
(mellow music)

8
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,716
Oh, my God.

9
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,017
(knife clanks in distance)

10
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,068
(mellow music continues)

11
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,908
(sizzles)

12
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,954
Hey, you're up.

13
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,291
Don't come over here.
Just sit right there.

14
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,669
I wanted to finish cooking
this before you woke up.

15
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:49,961
What a mess.

16
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,299
Have you never cooked before?

17
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:55,759
(gasps)

18
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,471
I didn't know that you could
burn something like this.

19
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,514
What's this?

20
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:01,973
Is it miso stew?

21
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,767
I've never done it before.

22
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,603
Just go and sit over there.
I'm trying to look cool.

23
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,480
(soft chuckle)

24
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,528
You know, I've been wondering,

25
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,531
who painted that?

26
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,658
Did you paint it yourself?

27
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,909
Oh, that?

28
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,994
Someone interrupted me
in the middle of painting it.

29
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,080
Who?

30
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,623
My first love.

31
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,625
Your first love?

32
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,919
Breakfast is ready.

33
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,962
Let's eat.

34
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,256
-Come on.
-(thuds)

35
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,550
(quirky music)

36
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,349
Oh, the chopsticks...

37
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,268
I'm not very good at using them.

38
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,395
I should try the stew.

39
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,648
Wow, look. There's a heart
and a star, too.

40
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,900
It's so pretty!
(chuckles)

41
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,861
It looks delicious!

42
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,487
(awkward chuckle)

43
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,783
(quirky music continues)

44
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,037
-Should we get takeout?
-I want pizza.

45
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,792
Pizza?

46
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,335
(music stops)

47
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,884
This is your dressing room, then?

48
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,260
(soft chuckle)

49
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:21,887
(gasps)

50
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,055
What are all these?

51
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,140
Oh, that?

52
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,225
Those are my protective gear.

53
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,560
Protective gear?

54
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,107
(playful music)

55
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,317
(gasps)

56
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,777
I can't see anything.

57
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,281
And I can't hear anything.

58
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,824
(gasps)

59
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,453
(playful music continues)

60
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,752
I'm going to test this.

61
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,130
Huh?

62
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,469
Okay.

63
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,223
Hey, Cha Minhu.

64
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,349
"Hey, Cha Minhu."

65
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,391
(gasps)

66
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,728
Cha Minhu is an idiot.

67
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,689
-"Cha Minhu is an idiot."
-(gasps)

68
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,401
(clears throats)

69
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,112
Cha Minhu is a dumb gofer.

70
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,199
"Cha Minhu is a dumb gofer"?

71
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,867
I heard that!

72
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,536
(snickers)

73
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,625
Then do you usually
have these things on you?

74
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,380
Wow, this is a bit of a headache.

75
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,508
So this is why you don't have
anything in your house.

76
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,388
I thought you might have OCD
or some perverted habit.

77
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,306
Well, it's kind of like that.

78
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,851
How did you endure all of it?

79
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,352
I tried medications and some tools,

80
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,062
things like that.

81
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,107
At this point, I can control it.

82
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,652
But I can't control it when
I'm kissing someone, weirdly enough.

83
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,364
That's why you're always so
annoyed and prickly

84
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,617
and unhappy about your life, huh?

85
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,955
Now I understand why you said
all those annoying things all the time.

86
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,373
-Hey!
-(soft chuckle)

87
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,500
(chuckles)

88
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,005
How long have you been like this?

89
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,219
MINHU: There was an accident
when I was 13 years old.

90
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,433
(Minhu shaky breathing)

91
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,189
(foreboding music)

92
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,733
(high-pitched noise)

93
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,363
(Minhu shaky breathing continues)

94
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,496
I woke up in the hospital
after passing out,

95
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,416
and they told me that
I had been out for a whole week.

96
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,047
(clock ticking)

97
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,134
(foreboding music continues)

98
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,059
(gasps, shaky breathing)

99
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,364
(groaning)

100
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,788
Weird things keep appearing,

101
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,166
and everything's so loud.

102
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,835
After that day,

103
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,088
my senses became nearly

104
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,382
ten times better than a normal person's.

105
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,426
Well, I think you endured it well.

106
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,636
Like me.

107
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,722
I had a hard time with it, too.

108
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,433
With the first future that I saw.

109
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,605
(machine beeping)

110
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,819
(dramatic music)

111
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,202
So I think I understand how you felt.

112
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,122
You were probably really scared.

113
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,290
I was like that, too.

114
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,088
You know, I've never told this to
one of my boyfriends before.

115
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,840
Me neither.

116
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,717
This is the first time

117
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,469
that I've told my boyfriend
everything about me.

118
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,305
It feels kind of weird.

119
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,808
I never thought I'd be
having this conversation with you.

120
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,561
I'm going to

121
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,563
put this away.

122
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,690
(light music)

123
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,616
(light music continues)

124
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,120
(gasps)

125
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,122
-(music fades)
-(gasps)

126
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,332
This is it.

127
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,333
What?

128
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,627
Nothing.

129
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,546
These clothes.

130
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,091
They're the ones that appear

131
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,426
when we sleep together.

132
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,261
You're wearing these clothes.

133
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:14,971
Ah.

134
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,931
Don't you wear these
when you have an important presentation

135
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,892
or when you're meeting with VIPs?

136
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,685
Yeah.

137
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,814
So I guess that day
is really important to you.

138
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,818
What were you wearing on that
special day, then?

139
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,446
I...

140
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,866
I was wearing a brown blouse
with lace on it.

141
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,367
Oh, that blouse from

142
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,496
the SS Season's Lisa Collection?

143
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,123
That one's pretty.

144
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,958
Why don't you wear it tomorrow?

145
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,668
What?

146
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,590
Do you think that I brought this up

147
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,218
because I want to do that
with you tomorrow?

148
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,762
I just mentioned it
because I saw this jacket right here.

149
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,514
Oh, yeah?

150
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,475
(light music)

151
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,060
(grunts)

152
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,688
I think I need to go back home.

153
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,858
-Right now?
-Yeah.

154
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,945
-It's urgent.
-It's urgent?

155
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,823
(toilet flushes)

156
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,036
Whew, that was close.

157
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,956
This is driving me crazy.

158
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,874
I mean,

159
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,627
just how far can he hear...

160
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,713
Damn it.

161
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,758
(music fades)

162
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,302
(thuds)

163
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,351
(pensive music)

164
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,940
What I saw yesterday

165
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,026
is the next time, I'm sure of it.

166
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,320
What's he saying in that future?

167
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,781
"Marry me."

168
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,284
No way.

169
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,369
He might like me a lot,
but this is too soon.

170
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,499
What did he say?
Why do I look so surprised?

171
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,502
"I"

172
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,337
"Love"

173
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,132
"I love you"?

174
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,052
(giggles)

175
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,512
Come on.

176
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,347
Wow, Cha Minhu.

177
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,392
That man. Wow.

178
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,394
I want your

179
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,062
letters of resignation.

180
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,273
Just resign if you're going to
do such a piss poor job.

181
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,444
Since you've still gotten nothing done
even though the preview date has been set,

182
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,447
I'm going to assume that you're fine
with working overtime from today.

183
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,494
From now on, let's just work
through the night together.

184
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,413
All of us. Like buddies.

185
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,248
Meeting's over.

186
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,211
Everything's so close together
on this schedule.

187
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,962
(sighs)

188
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,716
(exhales deeply)

189
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,302
(playful music)

190
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,934
What's wrong with you, Yesool?

191
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,645
What's so special about that
one sentence, "I love you"?

192
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,896
(sighs)

193
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:11,773
(phone vibrates)

194
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,900
MOM
SLIDE TO ACCEPT

195
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,488
Yeah, Mom.

196
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,698
Are you sure you didn't send it?

197
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,077
Why would I send you flowers already?
It's not even your exhibition yet.

198
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,371
Maybe Mr. Kim sent them for you.

199
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,082
He said he didn't. How strange.

200
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,086
Did you tell your boyfriend
to come to the exhibition?

201
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,504
No.

202
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,589
Don't you think it'd be a bit weird?

203
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,299
We haven't even been dating for that long.

204
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,759
Make sure to bring him, okay?

205
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,053
If you don't, I'll go visit you at work
so I can see him.

206
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,263
Are you insane?

207
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,348
Fine.

208
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,474
I'll ask him.

209
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:47,976
I'll go.

210
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,896
Mom, he said he can go.
I'm hanging up now.

211
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,315
(phone beeps)

212
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,901
-Are you really going to go?
-Yeah.

213
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,778
I feel a bit nervous, but I will.

214
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,739
Why aren't you wearing it?

215
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,157
Wearing what?

216
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,244
(upbeat music)

217
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,663
Are you crazy?

218
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,083
Do you think
I'm only interested in having sex?

219
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,335
Besides, I'm not going to
worry about the future anymore.

220
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,962
I'm going to take charge of my role
in this relationship.

221
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,755
So, don't try to

222
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,924
seduce me.

223
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,261
I have a meeting with Mr. Lee Pilyo.
I'll see you later.

224
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,470
Didn't you get the message?

225
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,472
I'm on my way to that meeting.

226
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,890
He asked for me.

227
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,643
I thought you had a meeting
with Ms. Oh Jiyoung.

228
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,853
You're going to that one.

229
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,354
She doesn't want to see me.

230
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,231
Bye.

231
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,026
(footsteps receding)

232
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,698
YOU MAKE ME

233
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,992
(light music)

234
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,413
(soft music playing)

235
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,914
(mouse clicks)

236
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,666
There's no need for any compliments.

237
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,334
I told you, I'm a good director.

238
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,963
You made a mistake at 2 minutes
and 23 seconds with the color corrections.

239
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,882
You need to turn down the red.

240
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,302
And at 3 minutes and 43 seconds,
you used a file straight from SoundCloud.

241
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,221
You can't get a sound like that
when you're shooting on the beach.

242
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,557
Our production team
will work on that right away.

243
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,142
(clears throat)
Uh...

244
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,353
With the ground shots in scene A...

245
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,106
(quirky music)

246
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,986
(mouse clicking)

247
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,573
The sound effects are all done,

248
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,077
and I'll send you
the edited version within this week.

249
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,787
I'll do the ADR with Ms. Oh,
and make sure that everything

250
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,247
is on schedule
for the advertisement to be aired.

251
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,167
All right. I'll be going, then.

252
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,213
PHOTOGRAPHER: Ready? One, two, three.

253
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,467
STYLIST: This one's a good picture.

254
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,843
Jiyoung, you look so good.

255
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,804
-You look so good.
-HAIRSTYLIST: You're so pretty.

256
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,555
STYLIST: I really like the theme
of this photo shoot.

257
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,891
(camera shutter clicks)

258
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,227
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Could you move it to the left a bit more?

259
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,814
Let me check the pictures.

260
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,817
-STYLIST: Sure.
-HAIRSTYLIST: That one looks good.

261
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,862
Jiyoung, I think it looks great.

262
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,949
Jiyoung, Ms. Hong is here.

263
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,036
Tell them that I'm taking a break.

264
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,123
I'm sorry, but let's take
a ten-minute break.

265
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,295
(dramatic music)

266
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,215
I don't know why you wanted
the meeting to take place in here.

267
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,926
You look beautiful today, Ms. Oh.

268
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,345
Do you love Minhu?

269
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,974
Do you really love him?

270
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,019
Why can't you
say that you love him right away?

271
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,314
If your feelings are so insignificant,

272
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,733
then I can't give up on Minhu.

273
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,071
Do you not love him that much yet?

274
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,115
I like him.

275
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,033
A lot.

276
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,287
I don't know why I'm saying this

277
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,581
to Mr. Cha's sister instead of him,

278
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,333
but I like him a lot.

279
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,755
I'll be on my way now,
if that answered your question.

280
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,883
(light music)

281
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:09,969
Also, Ms. Oh,

282
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,514
don't ever kiss Cha Minhu again.

283
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,183
He's mine.

284
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,728
The only person
who can date him or kiss him

285
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,229
is me.

286
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,397
Cha Minhu

287
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,107
is mine now.

288
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,443
(light music continues)

289
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,907
Do you still like him
after learning everything about him?

290
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,700
Now that I know everything,

291
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,578
I think I like him even more.

292
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,789
(light music)

293
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,502
(sighs)

294
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,046
(music stops)

295
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,680
Huh.

296
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,850
I can't believe that Oh Jiyoung
was trying to test me like that.

297
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,269
Who does she think she is?

298
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,395
(tongue clicks)

299
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,606
(mellow music)

300
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,650
Also, Ms. Oh,

301
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,487
don't ever kiss Cha Minhu again.

302
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:10,947
He's mine.

303
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,116
(mellow music continues)

304
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,162
So Cha Minhu's mine now, huh?

305
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,290
-(gasps)
-Yes, I'm yours.

306
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,667
(soft chuckle)

307
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,714
Did your meeting with Mr. Lee go well?

308
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,675
Yeah, yours?

309
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,926
Mine went well too.

310
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,637
Why am I yours all of a sudden?
What did you talk about with Jiyoung?

311
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,391
I just told her to not touch your lips

312
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,393
because you're mine.

313
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,394
What?

314
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,064
By the way, it's okay
if I don't kiss you on the lips, right?

315
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,696
This doesn't hurt, right?

316
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,781
(mellow music)

317
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,828
(footsteps receding)

318
00:17:58,953 --> 00:17:59,996
(music fades)

319
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,419
(light music playing)

320
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,642
(exhales deeply)

321
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,816
(light music playing)

322
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,620
CHICKEN FEET

323
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:41,746
CHICKEN GIZZARDS,
CHICKEN CARTILAGE,

324
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,415
Why did you call me here?
Do you not have any friends?

325
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,878
I don't have to put on a fake smile
in front of you,

326
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,631
I can tell people
that we're talking about work,

327
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,468
and I can talk shit
about Hong Yesool with you.

328
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,348
Didn't you say that
you don't eat at places like this

329
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,016
and that you can't eat foods like these?

330
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,851
Why wouldn't I eat these?

331
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:08,606
I love using delivery apps.

332
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,610
I just don't eat these
when other people are looking.

333
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,904
(quirky music)

334
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,907
Ma'am, could you bring us another glass?

335
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,033
WOMAN: Sure.

336
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,453
Here you go.

337
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,583
SOJU

338
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,296
(sighs deeply)

339
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,549
What's so attractive about Hong Yesool?

340
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,510
How do you expect me
to tell you that right here?

341
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,429
-It'll take several days at least.
-Is she even more attractive than me?

342
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,557
How am I supposed to know
what's attractive about you?

343
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,476
How could you not know that?

344
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,312
The entire country knows.

345
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,523
Why do these men not know about it?

346
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,149
"These men"?

347
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,611
Cha Minhu?

348
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,530
(slurps)

349
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,948
(sighs deeply)

350
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,658
Right.

351
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,245
What's so attractive about Cha Minhu?

352
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,580
I can't tell you all of it.

353
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,833
It would take me several days and nights.

354
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,837
Don't you think that I'm a bit taller
than Cha Minhu?

355
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,175
And my face is a lot smaller
than Hong Yesool's.

356
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,346
On top of that, my facial features
just look better.

357
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,100
I'm thinner than her, too.

358
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,729
I think my voice sounds
a bit better than Cha Minhu's.

359
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:33,274
Right? He's got everything else,
but his voice...

360
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,152
Okay, I'll give you that.

361
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,194
(scoffs)

362
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,656
Do you want to form an alliance?

363
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,616
We can support each other's love lives.

364
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,704
Never mind.

365
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,039
It's probably too late.

366
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,501
How am I supposed to

367
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,755
watch Minhu date someone,

368
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,216
and laugh,

369
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,511
and kiss another woman?

370
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,680
(somber music)

371
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,184
Yesool looks really pretty
when she's in love.

372
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,062
She just looks so lovely
when she's in love with someone.

373
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,567
Her eyes. They're so pretty.
(sighs)

374
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,487
So I wanted to be the only one
who could see her like that.

375
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,906
But now I'm watching her

376
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,952
look at someone else like that.

377
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,038
(somber music continues)

378
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,210
(exhales deeply)

379
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,340
Wow.

380
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,301
His fingers are sexy too.

381
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,179
(heartbeats rapidly)

382
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,141
Why's your heart beating
so fast all of a sudden?

383
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,562
Because I like you. What's the problem?

384
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,106
My heart is beating fast
because I want it to.

385
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,443
(soft chuckle)

386
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,281
(quirky music)

387
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,579
I want to give him a hug from the back.

388
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,749
Didn't you say you want
to keep this a secret?

389
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,543
That's why I'm not doing it!

390
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,294
(soft grunt)

391
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,842
(quirky music continues)

392
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,559
I want to kiss him.

393
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,564
(playful music)

394
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,527
Oh.

395
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:43,988
There you go again.

396
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,365
Yesool, you know that you get obsessed
when you start dating someone.

397
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,992
Are you really going to start this again?

398
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,160
Hong Yesool.

399
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,621
You need to work. Let's work.

400
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,208
You need to work, Yesool.

401
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,543
Let's work.

402
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,004
(exhales deeply)

403
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,089
(quirky music)

404
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,595
(keyboard clacking)

405
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,686
THE LOVE PLAN
REGARDING THE FIVE SENSES

406
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,313
What's this?

407
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,233
As the best employee
in ZEU's Planning Team 1,

408
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,486
I've come up with a plan
for us to date each other at work.

409
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,906
This plan makes good use
of your abilities,

410
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,910
so I named it "The Love Plan
Regarding the Five Senses".

411
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,453
(upbeat music)

412
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,872
First, a love contract,
and now a love plan?

413
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,375
Yes.

414
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,669
I really want to kiss you.

415
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,923
Don't you want that too?

416
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,175
I do.

417
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,680
We both have risks that come
with kissing someone.

418
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,725
This is a plan to minimize those risks.

419
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,188
So, the places that we can kiss

420
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,942
are our faces, necks, hands, et cetera.

421
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,028
During the week, and at work,

422
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,073
we're only using my lips.

423
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,868
YESOOL: Texts, our company's
messenger app, and post-it notes

424
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,287
all leave behind some kind of evidence.

425
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,499
We're going to set up secret codes for
the locations and times for our kisses.

426
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,210
We'll have to utilize
your abilities for this plan.

427
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,753
THE LOVE PLAN REGARDING
THE FIVE SENSES

428
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,838
(upbeat music)

429
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,599
(upbeat music continues)

430
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,687
7 p. m., at the emergency staircase.

431
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,817
(upbeat music continues)

432
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,905
(grunting)

433
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:59,790
YESOOL: We'll minimize each other's risks
in a way that's fair for both of us.

434
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,960
If you kiss me,
you'll be in pain, so I'll do it.

435
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,639
KISSING MANUAL
SOUNDS KNOCKING - ARCHIVE

436
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,891
YESOOL: This is our secret romance,
using your abilities to the fullest.

437
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,270
This is what your abilities are for.

438
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,315
(upbeat music)

439
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,197
(upbeat music continues)

440
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:41,206
Wait. I don't want you
seeing the future, so I'll do it.

441
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,916
Okay.

442
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:52,426
SCENTS GRAPEFRUIT SCENTED
HAND LOTION - CAFETERIA

443
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,477
If I put on hand lotion
with a grapefruit scent,

444
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,020
it means "meet me at the cafeteria".

445
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,734
(exhales deeply)

446
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,862
I like it.

447
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,030
What do you think?

448
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,115
-This... Hey!
-Ah.

449
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,288
Hey, we need to work.

450
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,916
(giggles)

451
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,962
So we're using about
four types of screens, right?

452
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,008
(sniffs)

453
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,888
YESOOL: Musk hand cream means
"meet me in the parking lot".

454
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,767
(upbeat music)

455
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,073
(gasps)

456
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,283
(breathes deeply)

457
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,121
(chuckles)

458
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,916
(music fades)

459
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,047
YESOOL: If I put my glasses
on the top of my head,

460
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,133
then it means
"meet me at the big conference room".

461
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:19,471
If we repeat the same methods,
then it won't be very secure.

462
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,768
(upbeat music)

463
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,859
Wait a moment.

464
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,112
Why do you get to send the signals,
and not me?

465
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,239
Because my senses are completely normal.

466
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,242
Do you have another idea
that won't get us caught?

467
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,577
Of course I do.

468
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,704
What is it?

469
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,998
(upbeat music)

470
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,503
(groaning)

471
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,007
What's wrong with Mr. Cha?

472
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,092
Look, look.

473
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,178
Didn't you see it?
Maybe the blinds are broken.

474
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:05,017
Anyway, can you help me
with this project proposal, Minhee?

475
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,687
(sighs)
I'm gonna get something to drink.

476
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,234
(upbeat music)

477
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,324
Thanks.

478
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,953
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes, sir.

479
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,247
Are you done with the proposal
for our next project?

480
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:31,376
Oh, I told Ms. Kim to...
Hey, Roma, where'd she go?

481
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,046
-She went to the bathroom.
-I'm almost done with it, sir.

482
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,797
I will make sure to finish it
as soon as I can.

483
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,259
(light music)

484
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:41,595
(mutters)

485
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:47,809
(sighs)

486
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,444
(door closes)

487
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,240
(light music continues)

488
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,621
(smooches)

489
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:11,959
Hello.

490
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,543
-Hello.
-Hello.

491
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,213
Hello.

492
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,548
(playful music)

493
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,801
(indistinct chatter)

494
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,388
(door closes)

495
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,518
(music fades)

496
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,395
(sighs)

497
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,772
I don't care anymore if it

498
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:35,983
hurts me or not.

499
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,236
(upbeat music)

500
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,333
(upbeat music continues)

501
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,049
ROMA: Where did Ms. Hong go?

502
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,427
I need to get her confirmation
on the post-recording files.

503
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,598
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

504
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,059
Ms. Kim.

505
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,395
Be quiet!

506
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,773
SANGGOO: Is Mr. Cha supposed to be
somewhere else for work today?

507
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,109
I need him to confirm the transaction
so that I can go home.

508
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:24,239
I think it's been exactly two hours
since Ms. Hong left.

509
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,365
Two hours?

510
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,452
I think Mr. Cha's been gone
for about that long, too.

511
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,413
Are the two of them...

512
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,664
(sighs)

513
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,000
-No way.
-What?

514
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,127
Did they go home already?

515
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,712
Come on.

516
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,589
No way.

517
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,340
(laughs)

518
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,925
What are you doing?

519
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,261
Go away. Go home.

520
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,679
Leave.

521
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:49,056
Leave.

522
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,766
SANGGOO: All right, let's go.

523
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,267
Yeah, you should go.

524
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,602
All right.

525
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,985
(light music)

526
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,875
(light music continues)

527
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,257
YESOOL: You didn't forget
about tomorrow, right?

528
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,425
I'm a bit worried.

529
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,636
What if she doesn't like me?

530
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,013
Why would my mom dislike you?

531
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,225
Well, it's a possibility.

532
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,811
I'm so nervous.

533
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:38,855
HOW TO BE LOVED BY
YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW

534
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,148
HONG YESOOL
MOBILE

535
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,485
YESOOL: There's no way that my mom
would disapprove of my boyfriend.

536
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,653
I'm hanging up now.

537
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,073
Ah... do you have anything
you want to say to me?

538
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,659
What?

539
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,327
Uh...

540
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,870
"Good night"?

541
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,123
Never mind then.

542
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,666
Bye.

543
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,377
(tuts)

544
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,420
Why isn't he saying it?

545
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,591
He's kissed me so many times,
but he still hasn't said it!

546
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,429
(light music)

547
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,308
Oh.

548
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,310
I've never seen that necklace before.

549
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,312
Where do I get that from?

550
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,064
(scoffs)

551
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,359
(music fades)

552
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,874
(soft music)

553
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,883
YOUNG YESOOL: Here, look.

554
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,553
It's a lot better.

555
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,554
Right?

556
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,599
EDIT

557
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,184
Oh.

558
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,769
Why does he look so familiar?

559
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,651
I showed her a picture
of when we were young,

560
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,653
but she didn't know anything about it.

561
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,198
She didn't recognize the painting
that we made together, either.

562
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,616
You showed her that?

563
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,786
Knowing how careful you are,
you probably told her for a reason.

564
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,706
Maybe you're hoping that
she'll recognize you

565
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,919
whether you know it or not.

566
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:28,006
KYUNGSOO: Just try it. That's the only way
that there will be a next time.

567
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,008
(sighs)

568
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,930
KIM SARA'S EXHIBITION
FIRST LOVE, WARM AND PAINFUL

569
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,267
(light music)

570
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,321
Why are you so tense?

571
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,530
Right.
(awkward chuckle)

572
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,449
Mom has an interview,
but she'll be here soon.

573
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,287
(all grunt)

574
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,373
(both yell)

575
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,250
(laughs)

576
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,293
Hi, brother-in-law.

577
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,879
I don't think we've ever met
each other before.

578
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,008
Ah... you...

579
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,178
So would you be my sister-in-law?

580
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,346
Sure.

581
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,848
(both laugh)

582
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,475
What's up with you guys?

583
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,103
Oh, my!

584
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,312
(gasps)

585
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,022
Look at the title of this painting.

586
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,857
"First Time".

587
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,027
What an interesting topic
to talk about, right?

588
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,783
Mr. Cha, did you have your first kiss
with your first love?

589
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,035
-How about your first sex?
-Hey!

590
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,454
Yesool, you need to know
about someone's first love

591
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:42,872
to know how they date someone.

592
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,749
Guys are crazy about "first times".

593
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,002
If you analyze a guy's first love,
you can find out all about his principles

594
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,378
when it comes to dating,
his painful memories,

595
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,879
and his life after his first love.

596
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,216
Why did you break up
with your first girlfriend?

597
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,093
Did you break up with her?
Was it the other way around?

598
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,428
That's...

599
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,931
a bit hard for me to talk about.
It's still a sore spot for me.

600
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,018
Come on, you need
to talk about those things.

601
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,478
It's easy for your first relationship
to end in a failure.

602
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,439
It's called "projective identification,"

603
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,525
where you project the things you don't
like about yourself onto your partner.

604
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,110
(sucks teeth)

605
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,696
I wonder what you
don't like about yourself, Mr. Cha.

606
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,364
Maybe you're too dependent.

607
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,366
Yesool's an adult, you know?

608
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,076
But you drive her to
and from work every day.

609
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,453
I think you're overprotective.

610
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,496
Did you see a future in which
you two fought about that?

611
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:25,790
No.

612
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,919
But I haven't been seeing futures
that are far away.

613
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,505
What do you mean?

614
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,300
I haven't seen anything really far
into the future lately.

615
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,510
SARA: Yesool.

616
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,014
Mom.

617
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,769
-Hi.
-Hi, sir.

618
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:47,937
(chuckles)

619
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,857
(inhales)
It's nice to meet you.

620
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,401
You're prettier in person.

621
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,363
She does look a lot like you.

622
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,489
Thank you.

623
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,698
Oh, Mom.

624
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,036
Hello, I'm Cha Minhu.

625
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,580
(light music)

626
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,042
(chuckles)

627
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,960
Oh, my goodness.

628
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,505
I guess fate does exist after all.

629
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,926
You must have been so surprised
when you ran into Yesool at work.

630
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,346
I was. I was also surprised
when I found out that

631
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,847
Yesool doesn't remember anything.

632
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:26,976
Minhu.

633
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:32,607
I've always felt so sorry about you.
And I've thought about you a lot.

634
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:38,321
Yesool and I went to the United States
when you were in the hospital

635
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,156
without saying goodbye.

636
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,077
Well, you couldn't do anything about that.

637
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:49,499
So, are you going to pretend
that you don't know anything?

638
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,126
I don't know.

639
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,753
I want to wait for her to remember,

640
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,089
but I also want to be honest
and just tell her about it.

641
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,926
Why don't we think about this
for a bit longer?

642
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,513
I also want to tell her
everything sometimes,

643
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,349
but when I think of how Yesool
doesn't have her memories from back then,

644
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,769
I sometimes wish that
she'll never get those memories back.

645
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,730
I change my mind several times every day.

646
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,900
Well, I'm sure that
there will be a good way to do it.

647
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,154
Until then, let's just enjoy our lives
as they are right now.

648
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,489
Life is too short.

649
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,410
And the time that you have
with your loved ones is even shorter.

650
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,287
(soft chuckle)

651
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,998
That's what he always used to say.

652
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:37,172
Also, I'm going to be gone next week
because I have an exhibition in Daejeon.

653
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,008
You're past the first base
with Yesool, right?

654
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,968
Yes. Wait, what?

655
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,637
No. I'm not.
(chuckles)

656
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,182
Yeah, I mean,

657
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,350
No.
(chuckles)

658
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,562
Have you tried Mom's cooking yet?

659
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,356
The way she seasons her food
is a bit different from other people.

660
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,486
When I first met her,
I told her that I'm a chef.

661
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,031
And she told me that
she likes to cook as a hobby, too.

662
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,909
When I ate the food that she cooked,

663
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,578
what should I say?

664
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,456
I was so shocked.

665
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:14,334
"Wow, I didn't know that
food could taste like this.

666
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,169
-I still have a long way to go."
-(exclaims)

667
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,755
She looks so happy.

668
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,757
I bet it's all because of you.

669
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,635
I'm the one who's happy here.

670
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,470
She's so bright, and a great person.

671
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,763
Ooh...

672
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,390
Where did those two go, anyway?

673
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,643
Yeah.

674
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,399
I was on a date with your boyfriend.

675
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,319
I was on a date with your boyfriend too.

676
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,321
One moment, Ms. Kim.

677
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:45,949
One second.

678
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,701
(classical music playing)

679
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,545
Uh... This came for you again.

680
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,548
I think you might want to
check the box this time, too.

681
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,716
(classical music playing)

682
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,306
(paper rustles)

683
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,433
(pensive music)

684
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,356
Who is this from?

685
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,316
I'm not sure.

686
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,861
The delivery man gave me this
and left right away.

687
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,279
I didn't get to check.

688
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,284
(pensive music continues)

689
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,418
(suspicious music)

690
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,795
(sighs)

691
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,515
(engine revs)

692
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,520
(music fades)

693
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,815
The edits look good.

694
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,984
If you had dragged it on
for half a second more,

695
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,236
it would have been too emotional.

696
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,614
But this is great.

697
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,408
Are you still not done with the sound?

698
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,412
I think you need a bumper
right before this scene.

699
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,331
That would be too emotional, then.

700
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,207
Trying to elicit emotions with music?

701
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,584
Only amateurs do that.

702
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,960
Your acting should be enough.

703
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:21,961
Oh!

704
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,672
I didn't know you could give compliments.

705
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,383
I'm complimenting myself.
I'm the one who filmed it.

706
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,053
Look at that angle. Isn't it so artistic?

707
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,056
(gasps)
I'm the one who made it look so good.

708
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,015
Look.

709
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,225
Can't you tell that I tried
to get a really good angle

710
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,728
because I knew where the camera was?

711
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,313
Well, it's not like you're a singer.

712
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,857
You shouldn't be aware
of the camera at all when you're acting.

713
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,067
(scoffs, chuckles)

714
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,071
You know,
our banter is getting pretty fun.

715
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,991
Maybe it's because we drank together
so often. We got fond of each other.

716
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,452
I don't want that fondness,

717
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,579
so don't ask me to go out
to drink with you so often.

718
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,998
You're mad because I didn't drink with you
a few days ago, too. Am I wrong?

719
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,083
Whatever!

720
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,168
Just do a good job with the ADR.

721
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,713
I hate having to record
the same thing several times!

722
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,132
Whatever. Just be careful
when you say words with "p" in them.

723
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,509
They don't sound that great.

724
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:11,678
Let's go.

725
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,598
YESOOL:
What did you talk about with my mom?

726
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,517
Just this and that.

727
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,893
Why? Are you curious?

728
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,187
Of course I am.

729
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,773
It's my boyfriend and my mom.

730
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,316
(chuckles)

731
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,110
Wait.

732
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,905
Close your eyes for a second.

733
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,491
All of a sudden? Why?

734
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,742
Just do it.

735
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,999
(light music)

736
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,335
Wait.

737
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,215
Ta-da.

738
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,678
(light music continues)

739
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,265
Didn't you buy this at the mall
a while ago?

740
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,225
How did you know? Yeah, I did.

741
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:00,852
It's pretty.

742
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,938
Mr. Cha, why have you still
not asked me out

743
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,649
after doing all these things

744
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,359
for me?

745
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,945
Ask you out?
I'm pretty sure I did that already.

746
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,655
I mean...

747
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,867
you know, those three words?

748
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,746
I still haven't heard them from you.

749
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,124
And why haven't you said
those three words to me yet?

750
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,169
I mean, I do like you.

751
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:30,339
But I don't like you enough
to say those three words, yet.

752
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,802
Ah...

753
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,891
Let me tell you something.

754
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:43,936
That day,

755
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,147
in the future.

756
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,690
You seemed like

757
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,777
you were really enjoying yourself.

758
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,404
You were having a hard time breathing.

759
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,407
That day, I...

760
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,827
(light music)

761
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:02,830
Really?

762
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:04,916
Yeah.

763
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,544
My underwear...

764
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,259
Really?

765
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,429
Wait a second.

766
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,640
Really? Right now?

767
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,730
I couldn't even breathe,
and her underwear...

768
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,732
Underwear...

769
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,527
Her underwear...

770
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:38,866
HONG YESOOL
CALLING

771
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:40,785
MR. CHA MINHU
SLIDE TO ACCEPT

772
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,874
-Yeah.
-You told me that

773
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,795
in the future, when we sleep together,
we break Jackson, right?

774
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,297
-Oh, yeah.
-Then

775
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,467
were the leaves really green?

776
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,219
Yeah.

777
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,264
Wow.

778
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,431
Why?

779
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,685
Jackson is shriveling up and dying.

780
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,604
What do we do?

781
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,690
There's no other solution.

782
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,899
How about tomorrow?

783
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,821
Then you know everything, right?
All the conditions?

784
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:21,284
(playful music)

785
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,497
(chuckles)

786
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,250
(phone beeps)

787
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,046
Wow, look at this guy.

788
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,382
(light music)

789
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,269
(light music continues)

790
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,531
(breathes deeply)

791
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,454
(light music continues)

792
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,216
We got a ton of feedback
on the advertisement!

793
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,718
We're working all night again!

794
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,012
(Sanggoo grunting)

795
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,349
(upbeat music)

796
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,156
(upbeat music continues)

797
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,251
I think we can wrap things up now.

798
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,086
Yes, sir.

799
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,295
(Sanggoo grunts)

800
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,009
They want us to edit the final version.

801
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,261
We're working all night today.

802
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,888
Honey, I'm working all night.
Sorry. I'll go home early tomorrow.

803
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,558
What do you mean, I'm drinking?
I said we're working all night.

804
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,644
-Roma, are we working all night or not?
-Yes, we are.

805
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,355
Come on, hit the mark.

806
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,273
(sniffles)

807
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,024
Come on!

808
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,570
Is that bitch Hong Yesool
giving you a hard time?

809
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,906
Yeah. It's all because of
that bitch, Hong...

810
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,158
(awkward music)

811
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,911
I know how you feel.

812
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,664
You must hate me.

813
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,793
You probably feel like
you never get noticed

814
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,420
because you're always
just helping me behind the scenes.

815
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,047
I bet you're always hoping that I quit.

816
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:45,386
No matter how hard I try,
I can't be as good as you.

817
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:50,349
I got that feeling too
when I had Mr. Cha as my mentor.

818
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,601
Besides, the reason
that you're crying like this right now

819
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,603
is because you want to be
good at your job,

820
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,063
and that's why you don't like me.

821
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:57,898
Yeah.

822
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:02,403
So just endure it
while talking shit about me.

823
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,989
You're supposed to talk badly
about your seniors.

824
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:06,741
(sniffles)

825
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,410
Ms. Hong, why are you so cool?

826
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,494
It's so annoying.

827
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,663
(scoffs)

828
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:14,999
Let's go.

829
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,459
Okay.

830
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,502
(light music)

831
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,714
By the way,

832
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,633
why have you been wearing
the same clothes for a week?

833
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,012
(sucks teeth)

834
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,847
I used to want to dress like you.

835
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,684
(quirky music)

836
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,478
(soft grunt)

837
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,900
(mellow music)

838
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,323
(chuckles)

839
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,328
(mellow music continues)

840
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,377
Bonjour.

841
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,630
Apparently, the director
of the MOPIX branch in France

842
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,382
is coming to the premiere tomorrow.

843
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,176
So they want the data and videos

844
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,887
entirely in French.

845
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,057
-(soft chuckle)
-Hm-mm.

846
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:15,643
(giggles)

847
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:19,021
(awkward music)

848
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,315
(music stops)

849
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,237
(gasps)
Mr. Cha...

850
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,114
(laughs)

851
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,074
I heard you're going
to the MOPIX premiere.

852
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,827
I bet it'll be approved right away.

853
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,286
Yes, sir. I need to get going now.

854
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,038
Wait.

855
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,543
Come on, I'm your senior at work.
Let's try to hold a longer conversation.

856
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:44,630
Yeah? No matter how good
your life is going right now,

857
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,049
you never know what'll happen next.

858
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,470
Mr. Cha, you could really get in
some trouble if you keep acting like this.

859
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,015
Hey, don't glare at me like that.

860
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:59,311
I'm just saying, getting in trouble
is normal for us.

861
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,233
Fine, I know that you don't want me
interfering like this.

862
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,610
So, no matter what happens,

863
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,572
I hope you do well. Good luck!

864
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,490
I'm off now.

865
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,453
(playful music)

866
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:20,416
(music fades)

867
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:23,794
JIYOUNG: Race through life together.

868
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:28,716
Yesterday and today,
you're always by my side.

869
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:31,594
Thanks, MOPIX.

870
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:34,972
Back then, and right now,

871
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,809
I'm still with you.

872
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:40,978
(sighs)

873
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:46,901
Thank you.

874
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,573
Thank you for honoring my memories.

875
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,576
This is a great advertisement.

876
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:59,330
I'm sure that Mr. Hong
would have loved it, too.

877
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:01,999
I'll do my best until the very end, sir.

878
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,292
All right.

879
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,419
Good work, everyone.

880
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,588
(light music)

881
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,182
(music fades)

882
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,600
(rooster crowing)

883
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,020
SANGGOO: Wait. This is bad.

884
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,481
It's that day already?

885
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,941
-What?
-What is it?

886
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,067
Do you really not know?

887
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,860
Sir, do you really not know?

888
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,737
If we don't use up all of the money

889
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,864
set aside for our company dinners
by today, it'll be gone.

890
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,783
It's going to just disappear
into thin air!

891
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,034
Disappear!

892
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,410
I'll be going now.

893
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:39,787
I still have some work to do.

894
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,081
Wait, what work?

895
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:45,876
We're done with Haroo, and you're
done with MOPIX too. You're jobless now.

896
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:50,047
Mr. Lee must be really shy.

897
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,132
Still, you should come with us.

898
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,759
Come on, Mr. Lee. Let's go.

899
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,345
I also have some work to do.

900
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,222
So, I'll be going now.

901
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,933
I thought
you finished everything yesterday.

902
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,685
Come on, Ms. Hong.

903
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,645
What about Mr. Cha?

904
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,314
Hey, don't bother him with this.

905
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,359
Mr. Cha has never come with us
to a company dinner.

906
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:14,738
Call Eomji, okay?
Tell her to come if she's not busy.

907
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,198
Yes, sir.

908
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,700
(indistinct chatter)

909
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:18,784
I'll see you tomorrow!

910
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,160
I'll see you tomorrow, sir!

911
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,205
(awkward music)

912
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,500
All right, everyone.

913
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:31,589
Let's all drink to...

914
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:36,677
the successful final MOPIX premiere.

915
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,179
Please raise your glasses,

916
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,098
and let's say "cheers"
on the count of three.

917
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,225
One, two, three. Everybody, cheers!

918
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:45,394
-Cheers!
-ALL: Cheers!

919
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,230
All right! Cheers!

920
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,566
ALL: Cheers!

921
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,942
EOMJI: Drink!

922
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,444
Great work.

923
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,195
Can I sit here?

924
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:57,448
(cheerful music playing)

925
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,327
Did I do well?

926
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,788
Aren't you going to drink, Mr. Cha?

927
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,583
Oh, I shouldn't. I brought my car.

928
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,502
So did I. Do you not want to call someone
to drive you home?

929
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,547
Or are you not very good at drinking?

930
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,800
Yeah. I'm terrible at drinking,
just like you.

931
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,719
(both laugh)

932
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:20,596
My goodness.

933
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,514
Everyone!

934
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:25,351
I think we must all be curious
about each other.

935
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:28,145
So, we need to play Truth or Drink!

936
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,439
Come on, let's play Truth or Drink!

937
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,523
Come on!

938
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,192
-Clap!
-(all cheer)

939
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,860
Drink! All right!

940
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,322
By the way, when Mr. Lee
and Mr. Cha have to drink,

941
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,366
please pour only a little bit of beer.

942
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:41,533
Why?

943
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,035
They're both terrible at drinking.

944
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,078
Hey.

945
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,665
(laughs)
Terrible drinkers, huh?

946
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,750
All right, then. Truth or Drink!

947
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,878
Truth or Drink, Truth or Drink!

948
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,172
(upbeat music)

949
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,764
(music stops)

950
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,643
(awkward chuckle)

951
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,897
Let's start with an easy one.
We've only just started.

952
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,649
Who was your favorite boyfriend?

953
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,069
(cheerful music playing)

954
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,698
(cup thuds)

955
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,033
(upbeat music)

956
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,079
(clears throat)

957
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,747
Me.

958
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,249
This one's a tough one.

959
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,877
-All right, let's drink!
-Hey, stop it!

960
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,213
What was your

961
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,674
favorite kiss?

962
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:39,883
(giggles)

963
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,052
-Your favorite kiss!
-Come on.

964
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,387
Look at you.

965
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:45,097
Damn it.

966
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,515
Hey, that's no fun!

967
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,016
You're drinking again?

968
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,978
(upbeat music)

969
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,274
(Eomji grunting)

970
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,610
-I'll do it.
-All right, let's go. Let's go!

971
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,321
Did you meet the inspiration
for the female lead of Haroo in Korea?

972
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:07,911
Why are all of you guys choosing to drink?
What kind of Truth or Drink is this?

973
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,873
I want to try it. I'm really good at this.

974
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,000
(clattering)

975
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,173
Have you forgotten your first love?

976
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,009
(sighs)

977
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,553
(breathes deeply)

978
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,101
Silence means "yes".

979
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,061
(Eomji clears throat)

980
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,898
I need to go the bathroom.

981
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,068
SANGGOO: Let's go.

982
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:42,237
EOMJI:
The assistant director worked so hard.

983
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:43,655
Why is he sitting so far away?

984
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,532
Come on, come closer.
I'll pour you a drink.

985
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:46,867
(indistinct chatter)

986
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,749
I didn't want to come, either.

987
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,709
I know.

988
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,753
I also know that you've been
avoiding me recently

989
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,296
to not make me uncomfortable.

990
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,380
Thanks.

991
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,382
I'm not that cool.

992
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,176
Yeah, you are.

993
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,304
Your advertisement
was really, really cool.

994
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,431
Thank you for trying your best,
like you said.

995
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:15,479
Of course it turned out well.
I'm a genius, and I tried hard, too.

996
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,647
Whatever.

997
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,566
I have somewhere else to be,
so I'm leaving.

998
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,152
Have fun with your teammates.
Don't mind me.

999
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:23,737
Bye.

1000
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,907
(light music playing)

1001
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,742
(door squeaks)

1002
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,122
(light music)

1003
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,625
(sighs deeply)

1004
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,793
(inhales)

1005
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,295
(phone beeps, trilling)

1006
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:44,716
Ms. Oh.

1007
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,260
You owe me this.

1008
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,554
I want to talk shit about Cha Minhu.

1009
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,138
(clattering)

1010
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,100
(all exclaim)

1011
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,185
Here's a hard one.

1012
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,605
Are you still

1013
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:03,110
dating your first love?
(shrieks)

1014
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,111
Hey.

1015
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,407
(all groan)

1016
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,785
(laughs)

1017
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,538
(clattering)

1018
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,833
(all gasp)

1019
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,460
(all laugh)

1020
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,421
Yesterday, I...

1021
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,714
Yesterday, yesterday!

1022
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,465
I'm already so excited!

1023
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,009
...texted

1024
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:29,761
my first love!

1025
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,722
Hey, that's not even that good.

1026
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,725
(awkward music)

1027
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,853
EOMJI: He can't drink that? How come...

1028
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,897
(all yell)

1029
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,442
Wow, I feel great, too!

1030
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,653
(clattering)

1031
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:50,407
(all groan)

1032
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,787
I want to see my first love again.

1033
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,122
(all giggle)

1034
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,624
I can't watch.

1035
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,584
Oh, my God.

1036
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,794
(all laugh)

1037
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,676
(yells)

1038
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,803
He's immediately choosing to drink!
What does that mean?

1039
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:14,598
Come on, spin it. Spin It yourself.

1040
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:17,476
(squeals)

1041
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,354
(all grunt)

1042
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,606
(all laugh)

1043
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,859
You're dating your first love right now.

1044
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:29,363
I can't listen to this! Oh, my God,
I can't listen!

1045
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,450
(all giggle)

1046
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:38,330
(upbeat music)

1047
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,082
(all exclaim)

1048
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:48,965
He keeps choosing to drink because
we're asking him about his first love.

1049
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:52,719
People are going crazy
because they've never seen him like this.

1050
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,262
What do we do?

1051
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:00,143
(cell phone beeps)

1052
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,273
MINHU: I'm going outside now.
You should come, too.

1053
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:06,942
I want to be alone with you.

1054
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,568
(quirky music)

1055
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,153
(cell phone vibrates)

1056
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,033
(gasps)

1057
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,369
What? What is it?

1058
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,250
(playful music)

1059
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,716
(yells)

1060
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,220
My finger slipped.

1061
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,181
I meant to send that to my girlfriend.

1062
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:39,891
Your girlfriend?

1063
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,895
Hey. "I'm going outside now.

1064
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,940
You should come, too"?

1065
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,317
Well, my girlfriend is also...

1066
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,111
working overtime.

1067
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,988
Mr. Cha, I think you had
way too much to drink.

1068
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:55,741
How could you text the company group chat
instead of your girlfriend?

1069
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:57,743
Wait.

1070
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:01,913
Is she here? Is she in the planning team?
Or the production team?

1071
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:03,165
Hey, stop talking nonsense.

1072
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,417
Do you think it's Ms. Hong
or something, huh?

1073
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,085
Or Eomji?

1074
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,547
Don't you dare... Oh, I'm sorry.

1075
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,048
I'm going to start the next game.

1076
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,842
The Name Game.

1077
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,011
-Everyone, introduce yourselves!
-Everyone, introduce yourselves!

1078
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,554
-(Eomji giggles)
-MINHEE: Okay!

1079
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,766
PIG SKIN, PORK BELLY,
SALTED MEAT, PORK RIBS, COW INTESTINES

1080
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,936
(light music playing)

1081
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,733
I think I might go back to the UK.

1082
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:33,820
Ever since I was young,
I've been good at game

1083
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,697
that required a lot of patience
and endurance.

1084
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:36,656
(inhales)

1085
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:41,536
So, I think that I might be good
at waiting for a long time.

1086
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,623
But, now that it's actually happening
in front of me,

1087
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,708
it's pretty hard.

1088
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,837
But when I see her looking so happy,

1089
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,089
I feel happy for her,
almost like a father.

1090
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,008
What on earth is this?

1091
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:56,927
What do you think?

1092
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,805
You're a clingy ex-boyfriend.

1093
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,641
(scoffs)

1094
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:06,520
Hey, why are you looking at me like that?

1095
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,731
Why are you laughing?
Are you trying to flirt with me?

1096
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,233
Because I got dumped?

1097
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,693
Are you crazy? You're not my type.

1098
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,195
Then what?

1099
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,239
Why did you look at me like that?

1100
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:22,077
I was thinking, "she doesn't know
what she's talking about".

1101
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,328
What?

1102
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:25,664
(scoffs)

1103
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,790
Whatever.

1104
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,583
You know, my acting
has gotten really good.

1105
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:32,295
Like, I'd be perfect for a romantic movie

1106
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,673
where I've just broken up
with my boyfriend.

1107
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,508
So you should write a movie

1108
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,468
with me as the main character next time.

1109
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:42,180
(sighs)
You're actually crazy.

1110
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,475
(quirky music)

1111
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:48,728
(groans)

1112
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:52,524
It's not fully cooked yet.

1113
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,693
(quirky music continues)

1114
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,364
(Minhu groans)

1115
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:10,333
Hey, what's so special
about your first love?

1116
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:11,585
How come you let them
make you drink like that?

1117
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,336
And it wasn't like you
to make that mistake.

1118
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,006
Did you forget about
what we're supposed to do today?

1119
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,924
Why did you drink so much?

1120
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,761
What was so special about your love, huh?

1121
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,471
I can't believe you.

1122
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,349
I really, really missed her.

1123
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:30,145
I'm so happy
that I can look at her all I want now.

1124
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:31,813
What are you even saying?

1125
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,316
Come on, Mr. Cha. Snap out of it.

1126
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,026
I know you're not that drunk.

1127
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,652
Hong Yesool,

1128
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,530
I really, really missed you.

1129
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,533
What's gotten into you?

1130
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:46,161
And I...

1131
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,246
YESOOL: "I love you"?

1132
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,041
I really wanted to date you.

1133
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,543
YESOOL: Damn it.

1134
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:54,628
And

1135
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,047
-I...
-YESOOL: "I love you"?

1136
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:01,676
I know that our relationship
started with us accidentally kissing,

1137
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:07,265
-(quirky music)
-And I think...

1138
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,019
we each have our own stories to tell.

1139
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,687
(laughs)

1140
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,108
Damn it. So you're never going
to say it to me, huh?

1141
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,528
(light music)

1142
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,081
(light music continues)

1143
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,082
(door closes)

1144
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:41,841
(rattles)

1145
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,760
(shatters)

1146
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,478
(upbeat music)

1147
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,156
(upbeat music continues)

1148
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:11,913
(music stops)

1149
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,959
(soft music)

1150
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,769
(light music)

1151
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:02,047
