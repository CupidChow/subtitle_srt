1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,087
(suspenseful music)

2
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,988
(doorknob rattles)

3
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,078
(door creaks)

4
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,543
(ominous music)

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,670
What happened?

6
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,802
(ominous music continues)

7
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,399
(breathes nervously)

8
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,288
(theme music)

9
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,762
HONG YESOOL, PLANNING TEAM 1

10
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,229
And about your suggestion for us
to go on three dates last time.

11
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,107
Fine. Let's do that.

12
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,735
PILYO: Be careful.

13
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,659
It took me three years to give you...

14
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,579
what you wanted so badly.

15
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,748
(dramatic music)

16
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,761
(breathes nervously)

17
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,221
EPISODE 6

18
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,431
(gasps)

19
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,891
How...

20
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,935
(gasps)

21
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,395
(sighs)

22
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:11,775
HONG YESOOL

23
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,907
BASED ON THE WEBNOVEL
KISS SIXTH SENSE BY GOT W

24
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,367
(sighs deeply)

25
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,285
Oh, no. What is this?

26
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,872
(foreboding music)

27
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,208
(plastic rustling)

28
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,965
Who...

29
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,591
(stuttering)
Who's there?

30
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,510
YESOOL (echoing): Who's there?

31
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,523
(shaky breathing)

32
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,738
(nervous breathing)

33
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,824
(ominous music)

34
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,332
(screams)

35
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,168
MINHU: Hong Yesool!

36
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,795
Shit.

37
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,047
Hey!

38
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,845
(pants)

39
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,138
Yesool.

40
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,306
Are you okay?

41
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,392
Mr. Cha.
(pants)

42
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,894
(siren blaring in distance)

43
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,353
(clamoring)

44
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,440
You said no money
or valuables were stolen.

45
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,150
Did you see his face by chance?

46
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,568
No.

47
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,862
(sighing)
It looks like there's

48
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,573
a surge of break-ins
of empty houses in this area.

49
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,325
It's the same MO,

50
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,452
so I think it's the same perp.

51
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,454
Get some rest tonight,

52
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,165
and please come to the station tomorrow
and tell us the details.

53
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,458
Okay.

54
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,003
(neighbors chatting)

55
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:06,097
(heartbeats)

56
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,605
MINHU: Are you okay? Are you sure
you don't need to see a doctor?

57
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,982
Yes, I'm fine.

58
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,569
But Mr. Cha, how did you know
when to come here?

59
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,488
Oh.

60
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,657
You didn't pick up the phone, so...
(inhales)

61
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,326
I got a call from Mopix
regarding the PPM schedule.

62
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:27,953
You called?

63
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,080
Oh, I didn't get any calls.

64
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,666
What do you mean?
I called you so many times.

65
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,044
-I don't think so. I'm sure...
-Ah, forget it.

66
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,505
That's not important right now.

67
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,674
Do you have a place to sleep tonight?

68
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,717
(light music)

69
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,678
You're not going to sleep here, are you?

70
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,139
(light music)

71
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,405
I can go by myself.

72
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,158
It's not my first time
sleeping in the office. I'm really okay.

73
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,828
I have to turn in a proposal
by tomorrow too.

74
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,163
Oh, I see.

75
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,460
I'll email the schedule
to Mopix in the morning.

76
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,259
(car horn honking)

77
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,969
(tires screech)

78
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,679
-(grunts)
-(tires screech)

79
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,723
(gasps)

80
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,392
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

81
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,476
Oh.

82
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,896
(stuttering)
No, I'm fine.

83
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,694
(whimsical music)

84
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,866
(chuckles)

85
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,291
(giggles)

86
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,378
YESOOL: What was that? The future?

87
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,673
(sighs)

88
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,258
(inhales deeply)

89
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,721
(sighs)
Okay.

90
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,139
I'll go now.

91
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,396
(gentle music)

92
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,989
YESOOL: What the heck?

93
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,491
What's going on?

94
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,877
(breathes deeply)

95
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,630
(heartbeats)

96
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,840
(breathes heavily)

97
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,887
(heartbeats)

98
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,103
Yesool.

99
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,108
YESOOL:
Do I really get together with Cha Minhu?

100
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,360
Are you hurt? Do you want to see a doctor?

101
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,154
YESOOL: No way.

102
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,032
How could that be...

103
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,785
Are you sure you're okay?

104
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,705
(heartbeats)

105
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:24,921
(coughs)

106
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,132
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,889
Oh.

108
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,725
(stuttering)
You were here.

109
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,520
(luggage rattling)

110
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,531
(door opens)

111
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,628
(sighs)

112
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,258
EOMJI: Are you going out with Cha Minhu?

113
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,013
-It's not like that.
-If not, what did I just see?

114
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,222
Tell me everything.

115
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,016
Or else, I'll spread the word
in the morning.

116
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,184
You know I have a big mouth.

117
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,435
(Yesool sighs)

118
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,771
YESOOL: A burglar broke into my house.

119
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,732
What?
(breathes nervously)

120
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,276
-A burglar?
-That's right.

121
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,279
If it weren't for Mr. Cha,
I'd be in bad shape right now.

122
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,365
He called me to discuss Mopix,
but I couldn't pick up.

123
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,284
So he ended up coming all the way
to my place.

124
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,368
(sighs)

125
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,330
Thanks to that,
here I am talking to you right now.

126
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,958
(sighs deeply)
Jeez, you must've been so scared.

127
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:49,339
But why did he touch
your forehead earlier?

128
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,217
And he was looking at you so tenderly.

129
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,386
YESOOL: What do you mean, tenderly?

130
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,931
Eomji, stop watching so many dramas.

131
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:02,435
He did that out of worry
because I was so out of it.

132
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,729
Is that the type of reaction one
has out of worry?

133
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,314
Jeez, if it's not a worry, then what?

134
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,150
What? Do you think we're really
seeing each other or something?

135
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,861
That could happen.
Hey, let's be blunt here.

136
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,447
Cha Minhu is a perfect ten
on a scale of one to five, no?

137
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,326
Eomji, but still,
how could I ever date Cha Minhu...

138
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,580
(light music)

139
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,840
You.

140
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,842
(scoffs)
I wasn't going to say this.

141
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,303
You know what? Let me tell you this.

142
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,972
Growing a soft spot for a guy

143
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,683
despite all the bad
and the ugly could be scary.

144
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,351
Huh? Think about it.

145
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,896
How many years
have you been working with him?

146
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:51,609
It's all because
something about you two click.

147
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,112
EOMJI: That's why you're working together,
don't you think?

148
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,196
Don't you think?

149
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,075
I'm tired of having to spell it out
for you. Do you get it?

150
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,285
Eomji.

151
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,497
You said Cha Minhu looked at me
tenderly earlier, right?

152
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,457
Not just tenderly.

153
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,836
His eyes were dripping
so much sweetness like honey.

154
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,380
(inhales deeply)

155
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,342
By chance,
are you already going out with him?

156
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,347
Not right now...

157
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,057
If not now,
are you saying you could be going out

158
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,350
with him in the future or what?

159
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,228
(sighs deeply)

160
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,439
I wish I didn't remember it for good.

161
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,316
Oh, I should've drank more that night.

162
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,484
(sighing)
Why did I have to remember...

163
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,614
Remember... Remember what? Shit!

164
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,574
It's just something, okay?

165
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,076
Jeez, seriously...

166
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,453
Goodness...

167
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,913
Of all people...

168
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,665
(sighs)
This is driving me crazy.

169
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,292
(shouts in frustration)

170
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,294
(grunts)

171
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,465
EOMJI: I'm going nuts here!
(shouts in frustration)

172
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,217
(sighs)

173
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,719
Oh, come on! Spill it!

174
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,393
(snores)

175
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,740
If I tell you, what can you do to fix it?

176
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,078
(sighs)

177
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:26,955
I told you.

178
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,582
We're bound to break up anyway.

179
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,251
I saw it.

180
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,045
(sobbing)
I can see it.

181
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,342
(laughs)

182
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,891
(gentle music)

183
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,518
YESOOL: It was my first time

184
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,520
seeing myself smile.

185
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,233
(gentle music continues)

186
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,472
Welcome.

187
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,394
Ten bacon and egg sandwiches,
ten turkey avocado sandwiches,

188
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,063
and ten hot Americanos to go, please.

189
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,898
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, wait.

190
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,319
Please add cold BBQ and shrimp.

191
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,821
And these.

192
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,533
I'll take these too.

193
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,453
-With the drinks, the total is 3...
-Wait.

194
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,663
Do you have any yogurt?

195
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,665
Oh, yogurt is down there.

196
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,381
MINHEE: So did you sleep here last night?

197
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,340
Yeah.

198
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,093
Ms. Jang happened to be working late too.
So we ended up sleeping here together.

199
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,804
Wow. Whoever that burglar is,
he's really gutsy.

200
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,515
There are surveillance cameras
in every alley these days.

201
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,601
So, Ms. Hong, did they catch the burglar?

202
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,605
No. Speaking of which,
I need to go to the station about that.

203
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,482
The whole neighborhood is chaotic.

204
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,817
Ms. Hong, is this an unlucky year for you?

205
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,527
You're getting caught up
in so many things.

206
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,907
I mean, should I keep my distance
from you for the time being or something?

207
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,992
Oh, come on, Mr. Kang.

208
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,912
MINHU: You all came in early this morning.
Good morning.

209
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,121
(Sanggoo gasps)

210
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,291
You didn't have breakfast yet, right?
Let's meet after you eat.

211
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,001
How did you know
that I skipped breakfast this morning?

212
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,252
Thank you for this.
I really appreciate it.

213
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,754
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

214
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,839
MINHEE: What is all this?

215
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,551
Aren't you going to eat?

216
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,388
Oh, I'll eat later.

217
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,520
VICE-PRESIDENT

218
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,732
Yes.

219
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,194
Come, Ms. Hong. These are delicious.

220
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,530
-The sandwiches we had the other day.
-Oh, okay.

221
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,783
(sighs)

222
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,161
It's definitely the picture from that day.

223
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:17,375
But I made sure we deleted it
right after sharing it.

224
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,129
If you made sure,
how could this be up on an online forum?

225
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:25,258
(chuckles awkwardly)
But it only had two views.

226
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,678
They deleted the post right away.
That's a relief.

227
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,680
I checked other automotive online forums.

228
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,182
I don't think it was leaked anywhere else.

229
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,183
PILYO: So what?

230
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,811
Mopix called me because they had
already found out that it was leaked.

231
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,855
(sighs)

232
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,607
Guys.

233
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,318
ASSISTANT:
It's not too late to tell him the truth.

234
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,736
Then, he'll forgive you.

235
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,031
No, I won't.
I'm not going to forgive you guys.

236
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,534
Does it look like my forgiveness
would clear up this issue?

237
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,497
What about ZEU AD?
Have you heard from them yet?

238
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,500
Should I call them?

239
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,962
(sighs)

240
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,718
(gasps)

241
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,136
Oh, my, this is...

242
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:11,804
(moans in bewilderment)

243
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,890
If Mopix sues us for breach of contract,

244
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,433
we may have to pay tens of billions of won
for compensation.

245
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,643
A new automobile model leaked by
the paparazzi.

246
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,270
-That hasn't happened in a while.
-(Kyungseok scoffs)

247
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,566
Planning Team 1 is incredible
in so many ways.

248
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,401
I know, right?
(sighs)

249
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:29,030
Shinan AD went belly up
five years ago over the same issue.

250
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,156
Remember that?

251
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,910
Jeez, the mere thought of it
makes me shudder.

252
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,870
Oh, boy.

253
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,707
How about Mopix? Did they say anything?

254
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,459
(sighs)

255
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,544
It must've already spread like wildfire

256
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,380
since it was posted
on a popular online forum.

257
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,798
We're in big trouble.

258
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,718
What did the Mopix security team say?

259
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,596
They used a VPN,
so it's impossible to track them down.

260
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,766
We're keeping an eye
on other forums right now.

261
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,353
What will you do
about damaging our company image?

262
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,481
It will only be a matter of time
before our other clients hear about this.

263
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,735
An unknown publisher deleted the post
and the picture right away.

264
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,029
MINHU: But we don't know when
or if they'll repost it.

265
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,740
Some other unexpected situations
could arise too.

266
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,201
So I'll keep an eye on it
and take responsibility for this.

267
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,244
(Sunhee sighs)

268
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,955
(snorts)
Of course, you should take responsibility.

269
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,874
Well, sir.

270
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,002
Is Planning Team 1 going to continue
with the Mopix project?

271
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,172
True. Since Planning Team 1
broke their trust,

272
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,132
it'll be tough for them
to keep the ball rolling.

273
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,553
If you're going to switch teams,
please let us know as soon as possible.

274
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,430
Planning Team 2 will need some time
to prepare too.

275
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,770
Mr. Cha, see me for a minute.

276
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,397
(sighs)

277
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,866
Jeez, I knew Planning Team 1
would get themselves in deep water.

278
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,869
It's Mopix's new model
that they're launching.

279
00:17:58,953 --> 00:17:59,954
Wasn't it you?

280
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,039
That's nonsense.

281
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,541
Was it you?

282
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,458
(slurps)

283
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,752
(scoffs)
I guess...

284
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,298
everyone was just waiting for you
to slip and fall.

285
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,466
My apologies.

286
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,593
I can see...

287
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,637
right through the person's
objective in this.

288
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,889
Am I the only one?

289
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,020
They posted and deleted it quickly
before it got out of hand.

290
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,731
Then tipped off Mopix.

291
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,649
You're quick,
so I'm sure you're well aware

292
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,526
that their purpose
wasn't to leak the model.

293
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,446
(sucks air)
It looks like...

294
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,533
someone tried to damage your reputation.

295
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,327
Does anyone come to your mind?

296
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,497
(both sigh)

297
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:47,251
I barely managed to quiet down Mopix.

298
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,671
But it'll be tough for Planning Team 1
to avoid the consequences.

299
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,548
I'm fully responsible for this.

300
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,384
I'll be sure to hand over the project
to another team ASAP...

301
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,138
Are you saying
you're going to drop out of the project?

302
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,517
I'd like you to take responsibility
for this

303
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,686
by completing the project successfully.

304
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,523
Of course, someone would have
to be held accountable for it.

305
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,948
MINHEE: But still, not Ms. Hong...

306
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,575
SANGGOO: Mr. Cha.

307
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,371
Technically speaking,
Ms. Hong is a victim too.

308
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,290
Yes, she failed to stop Director Lee
from taking pictures of the car.

309
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,958
That is her fault.

310
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,835
But as we all know,

311
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,962
all directors take pictures
of the new product

312
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,090
they'll film before its release.
Isn't that so?

313
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,842
We know they do it,
and we just turn a blind eye.

314
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,346
It's too bad it leaked,

315
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,891
but I think it's unfair
to put the entire blame on her...

316
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,267
It's already been decided.

317
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,436
Ms. Hong will drop out
of the Mopix project as of today

318
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,398
and will be dispatched
to Planning Team 2 to support them.

319
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,526
Ms. Kim will take over Ms. Hong's tasks.

320
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,902
Okay.

321
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,406
Ms. Hong, please go to Planning Team 2.

322
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,283
All right.

323
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,711
(sighs deeply)

324
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,550
YESOOL: These files are not
on our shared server.

325
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,386
I drafted them just in case,
so take a look if you need them.

326
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,595
It will be helpful.

327
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,473
Is it okay for me to take this from you?

328
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,352
How do I do this without you?

329
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,855
Why not? It's a good opportunity for you.

330
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,816
You'll be fine. No need to whine.

331
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,947
Everyone, I'm fine. Okay?

332
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,199
It's not like I'm getting fired.

333
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:46,245
Enough of this heavy vibe. Please stop.

334
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,539
We feel bad. That's all.

335
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,667
Everyone here knows that you worked
really hard on this project.

336
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,296
Goodness, it's okay.
You should've been nicer to me all along.

337
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,298
It worked out for the best.

338
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,800
I failed as the PM on Mopix anyway.

339
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,052
And it's not like
this is the only chance I have.

340
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,054
(sighs)
I'll just have to do better next time.

341
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,347
Ms. Hong.

342
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:09,059
Anyway, I'll get going.
Good luck, everyone.

343
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,228
Work hard for me too.

344
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,689
I'll get going.

345
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,035
Shit.

346
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,081
(grunts)

347
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,584
Mr. Cha.

348
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,962
How can you leave without saying bye?

349
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,800
Jeez, I'm just moving downstairs.

350
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,802
It's not like I'm transferring
to that team permanently.

351
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,762
You're so lax.
(inhales)

352
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,472
Is this what I taught you?

353
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,349
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,017
Why aren't you arguing with me?

355
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,646
I thought you'd come
straight to me and ask to reconsider.

356
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,564
Did you finally grow up?

357
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,442
Mm.

358
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:01,070
Someone has to be held accountable,

359
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,781
and I can't deny
that I'm partly responsible for it.

360
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,827
And I'm sure you had your reasons

361
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,162
for coming to that decision.

362
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,916
Well, I don't want to admit it,

363
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,504
but you have never been wrong.

364
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,132
(sighs)

365
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,718
Don't worry.

366
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,888
Even if they give me a hard time
or pick on me, I'll hang in there.

367
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,516
-I can take care of myself.
-That goes without saying.

368
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,809
Of course, I should...

369
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,311
Do your job well.

370
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,773
If you get sloppy
and shame Planning Team 1's reputation,

371
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,984
never mind transferring you
to another team.

372
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,862
I'll transfer you to another city
in another province. Got it?

373
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,661
(scoffs)

374
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,664
I mean, I'm leaving the team,
and he still...

375
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,291
(sighs)

376
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,625
Of course.

377
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,461
That's who Cha Minhu is.

378
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,547
Jeez.

379
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,675
(mellow music)

380
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,054
Hello.

381
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,306
Hello.

382
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,725
-Your desk.
-YESOOL: Oh, okay.

383
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,896
We'll be out for lunch.

384
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,148
Oh, enjoy your lunch.

385
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,441
See you.

386
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,361
(mellow music)

387
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,680
(whimpers)

388
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,015
(sighs)

389
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,851
(exhales deeply)

390
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,732
(sniffles)

391
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,694
Dang it. I've been holding back.

392
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,239
What's wrong, Hong Yesool? Stop crying.

393
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,117
(sniffles)

394
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,412
It's fine.

395
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,166
You can do better on Mopix next time.
(sniffles)

396
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,876
YESOOL: It's all right.

397
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,380
(Yesool sobbing)

398
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,924
YESOOL: What's wrong with you?
So embarrassing.

399
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,135
(Yesool sniffles, sobs)

400
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,513
Why don't you come inside?

401
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,182
Oh, no. I feel so at home here.
I like it here...

402
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,600
Thanks anyway.

403
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,268
-We'll stay here. Yes.
-Okay.

404
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,603
Thank you.

405
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,484
The atmosphere seems brutal.

406
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,612
So, to sum it up,

407
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:52,116
Ms. Hong Yesool is taking
full responsibility for this matter?

408
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,534
Is that what you're saying?

409
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,619
Yes, that's right.

410
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,872
(sighing)

411
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,917
It wouldn't make any difference
even if I talked to Mopix, would it?

412
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,131
(sighs)

413
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,509
First of all,
I apologize for what happened.

414
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,429
It's obviously my fault
that the picture was leaked.

415
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,140
I'll cooperate
with the internal investigation.

416
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,518
Let's complete
this project successfully first.

417
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,189
I believe the PPM video will be crucial
in restoring their faith in us.

418
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,358
Don't worry about that.

419
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,528
I'm going to nail it.

420
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,701
That's the only thing I can
do to help Ms. Hong return to your team.

421
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,538
Also, can you check
with Ms. Oh Jiyoung and find out

422
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,165
if she's available for the PPM video?

423
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,334
(inhales deeply)
I'll convince Oh Jiyoung.

424
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,546
Please do your best
in preparing for the shoot, Director.

425
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,382
All right. Then we'll prepare accordingly.

426
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,134
All right then.

427
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,137
Can I ask you something?

428
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,267
(sucks air)
By chance, did Ms. Hong...

429
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,979
cry?

430
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,487
(breathes deeply)

431
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,573
(light music)

432
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,120
YESOOL

433
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,206
(light music)

434
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,089
(sighs)

435
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,841
(sighs deeply)

436
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,261
SUNHEE: What?

437
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,056
-No one has any other ideas?
-(mumbles)

438
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,559
It's a new brand, so there aren't
many reference materials...

439
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,144
(sighs)

440
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:47,439
As far as I know, Miracle was started
by Ciotem's product development team

441
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,066
after they broke off from Ciotem.

442
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,819
I presume they're currently developing
their own skincare products.

443
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,153
I'll share the competitor

444
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,614
and market analysis
over the last three years.

445
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:57,908
Okay. Um...

446
00:26:58,951 --> 00:26:59,993
(clears throat)
Uh-huh.

447
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,787
(breathes deeply)

448
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:07,292
And print out the documents we'll be using

449
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,170
at the lingerie PPM...

450
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:13,674
I've already made 20 copies
and I emailed them to you as well.

451
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,010
Oh, there were a lot of typos,
so I corrected them all.

452
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,513
(laughs awkwardly)

453
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,266
(woman clears throat)

454
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,520
Okay, you may go now.

455
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,772
Yes.

456
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,989
(door opens, closes)

457
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,827
(sighs deeply)

458
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,745
You think this is a coffee shop?

459
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,455
(coughs)

460
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:47,916
Shit, I'm about to lose it.

461
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,668
-Mm.
-Hello.

462
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,961
-Sit, sit, sit.
-Okay.

463
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,797
(inhales deeply)
Well...

464
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,050
Here are about 50 reference videos.

465
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,804
Can you check and see if there's anything
useful for any of the time slots?

466
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,389
Oh, I did that already.

467
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,809
You should check these out too.

468
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,353
There were a lot of references,
but you didn't use them.

469
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,607
Oh, I also shared some files with you.
Please check them out as well.

470
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,567
(laughs)

471
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,404
Planning Team 1 always wastes time
and energy gathering useless references.

472
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,031
(laughs)

473
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,532
So you don't need them?

474
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:24,328
Oh, dear.
I'll take them since you put in the work.

475
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,830
I'll look through them.

476
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,215
(chewing ice)

477
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,176
(sighs)

478
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,845
Jeez, what a pill.
(chewing ice)

479
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,556
Whoa. Shit, I want her on my team.

480
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,849
(slurps)

481
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,978
How did Cha Minhu train her?
She carries her weight and then some.

482
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,230
-(chuckles)
-(Sunhee sighs)

483
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,817
(sighs)
How's Hong Yesool?

484
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,527
Intense, isn't she?

485
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,780
I think it's going to take
a long time to teach her.

486
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,282
She didn't learn much from Team 1.

487
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,409
(snorting) Really?

488
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,286
(slurps)

489
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,249
I think you went a little too far
this time.

490
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,334
Huh?

491
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:13,877
What are you talking about?

492
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:18,799
Leaking the new model is going too far.
Good thing Mopix let it go at that.

493
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,968
It was too risky for the agency.

494
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:22,803
(scoffs)

495
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,180
What are you talking about?

496
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,683
(sucks air)

497
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,142
Hey, Sunhee.

498
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:33,063
Stop barking up the wrong tree.
Get back to work.

499
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,356
Okay?

500
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,440
(clicks tongue)

501
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,067
I'm off.

502
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,194
(chuckles)

503
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,362
(laughs)

504
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,322
-(humming)
-My goodness.

505
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,117
(scoffs)

506
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,913
SEUNGTAEK: Howoo, please answer the phone.

507
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:53,583
I miss you, Howoo.
Are we really over? For real?

508
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,169
(sighs deeply)
Why won't you read my messages?

509
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,298
I'm sorry about everything.

510
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,592
Howoo, we didn't break up for real,
did we?

511
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,556
Doctor.

512
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:09,683
Doc...

513
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:16,857
(gasps)

514
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,358
Shit, you startled me.

515
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,193
Mind your manners, man!

516
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,446
Why did you clap like that?
You rude bastard.

517
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,199
The students assigned to internal medicine
are waiting for you over there.

518
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,617
They want to say hello to you.

519
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:32,664
Hey, do I have to bother training students
at my level? Do I? Huh? Hey!

520
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,750
I apologize, sir.

521
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,293
(sighs deeply)

522
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,628
Seriously.

523
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,881
Where are they? (sighs)

524
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,591
They're all over there.

525
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,927
-Don't startle me like that again.
-I won't.

526
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,058
This way, sir.

527
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,642
Hi.

528
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,478
-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello, Doctor.

529
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,645
Did you guys eat?

530
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,064
-Yes, we did.
-Yes.

531
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,607
What did you eat?

532
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,566
(pants)

533
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,692
Dang it.

534
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:01,777
(pants)

535
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,278
-I'm sorry!
-Frog meat.

536
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,238
I'm sorry, sir!
(pants)

537
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,615
(exhales deeply)

538
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,866
Oh!

539
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,910
How do you do, Doctor?

540
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,037
(sighs)

541
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:13,830
Huh?

542
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,334
Huh?

543
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,838
YESOOL: My boyfriend?

544
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,090
Yes.

545
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,592
The man who gave us the details
about the incident.

546
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,843
Isn't he your boyfriend?

547
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,180
Wow, he was... He was quite a talker.

548
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,225
8:42 p. m. Sara Kim
is the owner of the house.

549
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,811
It happened
at the tenant Hong Yesool's house.

550
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,605
Based on the strides,
I presume the perpetrator

551
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,857
is 172 cm tall with a shoe size 275.
I think it's a man.

552
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,318
Considering the sounds
of his running footsteps were nonstop,

553
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,320
he likely figured out
an escape route beforehand.

554
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,823
So it's highly probable
that he's either someone familiar

555
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,324
with the area or a resident there.

556
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,701
Aren't you writing this down?

557
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,954
I will.
(clears throat)

558
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,289
Have you checked the surveillance cameras

559
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,667
at the convenience store, intersection,
and shopping center near her house?

560
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,086
Oh, is there a surveillance camera
at the shopping center?

561
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,963
Yes, there's one in the
second-floor office

562
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,256
for staff surveillance.

563
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,049
It captures the street as well.

564
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,926
If that's his escape route,

565
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,594
he must've been caught on that camera.

566
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,180
Ah, so there is
a surveillance camera there.

567
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,473
I got it.

568
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,521
OFFICER: You know, I felt like
I was being questioned by him.

569
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,232
He described it so well in so much detail.

570
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,067
And he sometimes scolded us too.

571
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,153
(laughs awkwardly)

572
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:31,449
By the way,
does your boyfriend work in this field?

573
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,244
He has to be a profiler, at the least?

574
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,497
(laughs awkwardly)

575
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,131
Boyfriend...

576
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,134
(sighs)

577
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,177
Jeez.

578
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,929
(siren wailing)

579
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,643
(indistinct chatter)

580
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,905
MINHU: Please move the latch for
the grid window guard to somewhere else.

581
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,947
Oh, okay.

582
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,574
-Oh, and one more thing.
-Yes?

583
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,367
Oh, hey.

584
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,539
The camera's blind spot is too wide.
We need to adjust the angle a bit.

585
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,499
All right. Look.

586
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,667
Here.

587
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,085
I'm not in the frame.

588
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,503
Oh, you're right.

589
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,507
(snaps)

590
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,680
(tires screech)

591
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,644
I don't sleep with a woman
I'm not interested in.

592
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,606
So, go out with me
if you want to sleep with me.

593
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,774
Are you sure you're okay?

594
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,654
MINHU: Yes, please do that.

595
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,656
I installed the CCTV app.

596
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,618
You'll get an alert
when someone opens or closes

597
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,536
the windows, so check that frequently.

598
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,664
Oh, right. The windows on the veranda
are triple-pane windows,

599
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,957
so don't forget to close them.

600
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,380
Hey, are you listening to me?

601
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,466
Mr. Cha, do you like me?

602
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:13,802
Yeah.

603
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,266
I left your bedroom windows open
to test the alarm system.

604
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:23,478
So be sure to close them.
I'm leaving. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay.

605
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,898
(romantic music)

606
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,024
(gasps)

607
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,657
(pants)

608
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,325
(sighs)

609
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,872
(pants)
Since when?

610
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,125
Since I joined Planning Team 1?

611
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,544
When was that? Five years ago?

612
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,713
And when you saved me
at the pop-up store...

613
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,173
Were you watching me the whole time
because you like me?

614
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,508
If you have feelings for me,

615
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,093
why didn't you grab me
when I fell down the stairs?

616
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,928
Do you know how embarrassed I was then?

617
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,680
When I was in charge
of the Billy campaign too.

618
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,557
I mean, you could've talked to me nicely,
and I'd still get what you mean.

619
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,267
But you were constantly angry
and yelled at me.

620
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,519
How can you do that
to a woman you're interested in?

621
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,480
-Are you a psychopath, Mr. Cha?
-Hey, Hong Yesool.

622
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,108
Oh.

623
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,152
(stuttering)
So... what I mean is...

624
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,486
Are you done asking?

625
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,031
(sighs)

626
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,450
I think I started liking you
from the time you joined the company.

627
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,577
But to be honest,
I started realizing it not long ago.

628
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,538
What happened at the pop-up store
was more of an instinctive reaction

629
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,206
rather than my feelings for you.

630
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,458
And the reason I didn't grab you
on the stairs

631
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,834
is because I wasn't feeling well that day.

632
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,461
Well, even if I explained it to you,
you wouldn't understand it.

633
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,503
So I'll pass for now.

634
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:31,796
And what else?

635
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,256
Oh, am I a psychopath?

636
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,217
Well? I just set aside
my personal feelings when I was at work.

637
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,261
If the woman I was interested in
was competent,

638
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,931
I wouldn't have had to get angry and yell.
I think it was a shame too.

639
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,392
Anything else you want to know? No?

640
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,771
Then, can I ask you one thing?

641
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,649
When are you going to give me an answer?

642
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,778
As you can see,
I'm not very good at waiting.

643
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,198
PILYO: Don't answer him.

644
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,705
You should take as much time
as you want in a situation like this.

645
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,290
That way, he'll agonize more.

646
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,752
Right, Mr. Cha?

647
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,046
(upbeat music)

648
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,972
(Yesool grunts)

649
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,642
I thought it was a line from a movie.

650
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,811
Are you going to use it
in your movie again?

651
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,063
No, not this one. This one offends me.

652
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,023
It would've been better
if you had just gone on your way.

653
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,858
PILYO: Unfortunately,
I was headed that way.

654
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,820
Wow, we're totally in sync.
You want to go out with me?

655
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,155
I win.

656
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,783
-That's enough, guys.
-(sighs)

657
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,618
You kicked her out of the team
in the morning,

658
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,370
yet you're asking her out in the evening?

659
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,705
Are you a psychopath or something?

660
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,082
I guess you forgot who caused the mess?

661
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,959
Do you have Alzheimer's or something?

662
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,294
Wow, we're even mirroring
each other's lines.

663
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,839
You sure you don't want to go out with me?
I even own a house in Seoul.

664
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,006
So do I.

665
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,259
I like this guy even more.

666
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,303
Have a drink.

667
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,639
No, Mr. Cha can't drink.

668
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,144
Oh, that's right.
Now, my memory is coming back.

669
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,312
I've heard that you can't drink.

670
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,522
(sighs)

671
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,316
You look as if you'd still be standing
after drinking a case of hard liquor,

672
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,318
but I heard you're a “one-shot wonder.”

673
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,112
But you managed
to survive in this industry

674
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,364
without wining-and-dining
with your clients, thanks to your talent.

675
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,742
(cheeky music)

676
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,202
(laughs awkwardly)

677
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,041
Are you crazy?

678
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,085
You can't drink, either, Director.

679
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,629
Oh, right.
(laughs)

680
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,089
I've heard that too.
(laughs)

681
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:41,676
That her ex often passes out
on the streets after just one drink.

682
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,679
How embarrassed she was
and what a nuisance he was.

683
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,514
(laughs)

684
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,225
That's not true.

685
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,727
I can handle my liquor.

686
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,853
People call me "Tomato"

687
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,105
because I can keep drinking
until my face turns red.

688
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,441
People call me "Sunflower"

689
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,443
because I can drink
until the sun comes up.

690
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,155
Let's have a drink.

691
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,490
Sure.

692
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,703
(both slurp)

693
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,540
(Pilyo exclaims deeply)

694
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,170
Hey, Tomato.

695
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,298
Sunflower.

696
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,344
-Oh, man. What happened?
-(moans in frustration)

697
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,303
ASSISTANT: What?

698
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,638
All this?

699
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,265
Our director is a one-shot wonder.

700
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,767
No, I drank this one.

701
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,060
-Oh.
-(laughs awkwardly)

702
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,604
-I see.
-It just happened that way.

703
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,398
Still, I'm glad you came,
Assistant Director.

704
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,483
(chuckles awkwardly)

705
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,444
Oh, yes. I was so surprised
when I got your call.

706
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,863
Well, Director.

707
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:47,242
-(groans)
-Wake up, Director Lee.

708
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,410
(sighs)

709
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,956
I guess he drank a lot
because he felt bad for you.

710
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,835
He was extremely worried when he heard
that you were transferred to another team.

711
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,461
He didn't even eat all day.

712
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,174
I'm fine. Please take him home.

713
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:06,261
(chuckling awkwardly)
Okay. We'll go ahead. Okay.

714
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,518
(both chuckle awkwardly)

715
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,020
-Good night.
-(chuckles awkwardly)

716
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,939
-Director Lee.
-(groans)

717
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,440
Get up, Director Lee.

718
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,401
-(grunts)
-(Pilyo moans)

719
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,028
-Let's go. Jeez, Director Lee.
-PILYO: I'm sorry.

720
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,573
(grunts)

721
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,700
-ASSISTANT: See you!
-Well, bye.

722
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,909
ASSISTANT: Bye.

723
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,787
-PILYO: Oh, boy. This is killing me.
-All right. Hang in there a little bit.

724
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,582
-Man.
-(Pilyo groans)

725
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,919
What do I do about this Sunflower...

726
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,259
-Jeez, seriously!
-(Minhu groans)

727
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,516
WOMAN (on phone):
The customer is not answering the phone.

728
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,728
Please try again later.

729
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,812
OH SEUNGTAEK

730
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,063
(sighing)
Dang it.

731
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,024
This is crazy.

732
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:02,817
Mr. Cha.

733
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,863
Mr. Cha? Please wake up.

734
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,073
Mr. Cha, your passcode is...

735
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,160
(sighs)

736
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,745
Hey.

737
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,079
Cha Minhu.

738
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,957
Get up. I said, get up!

739
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,880
(moans in frustration)
Sunflower, my ass. Shit.

740
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,262
Here we are at Tri Palace.

741
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,222
Oh.

742
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,311
I'm sorry, but please go back
to Myeongdong.

743
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,021
TAXI DRIVER: Okay.

744
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,151
(Yesool grunts)

745
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,112
Shit, so heavy.

746
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,406
Why won't he pick up?

747
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,077
(grunts)

748
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,829
Seriously.
(sighs)

749
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:58,790
(sighs deeply)

750
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:03,252
Dang it, what did I do
in my past life to deserve this?

751
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:06,089
(panting)

752
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:10,677
What an asshole. Does he really like me?

753
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:12,845
(grunts)

754
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,098
I really don't think so.

755
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,643
(sighs)

756
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,569
Hey.

757
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,196
Cha Minhu.

758
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,406
(sighs)

759
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,157
You're not asleep, are you?

760
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,493
Are you sure you like me?

761
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,453
Huh?

762
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,540
(sighs)

763
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,459
You're so weird.

764
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,504
You ask me to go out with you
out of the blue.

765
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,508
Then today, you tell me you like me.

766
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:52,927
Sure.

767
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,515
I guess we do get into a relationship,
as you said.

768
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,686
Jeez, that's crazy.

769
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,397
How could you and me...

770
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:07,692
(sighs)

771
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,697
But I looked happy.

772
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,116
It was my first time...

773
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,286
seeing myself happy...

774
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,289
in the future that I foresaw.

775
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,376
(light music)

776
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,463
(birds chirping)

777
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,036
(light music continues)

778
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,096
(light music fades)

779
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,570
(whirring)

780
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:36,739
(buzzing)

781
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:42,036
(indistinct chatter)

782
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:47,875
Just coming in?

783
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,003
Are you feeling okay?

784
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,255
Yeah.

785
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,631
How much did I drink last night?

786
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,842
I was at your place when I woke up.

787
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,887
Mr. Cha, you have only one friend.

788
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,014
But Dr. Oh didn't pick up.

789
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,392
So, what else could I do?

790
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,227
I don't know
your front door passcode, either.

791
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,312
So I had no choice
but to take you to my place.

792
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,898
(sighs)
Last night...

793
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,775
You feel awfully sorry, don't you?

794
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,653
Do you know what I went through
last night because of you?

795
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,196
(sighs)

796
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,324
Oh, I have a meeting to attend.
So I'll get going.

797
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:21,450
Good day.

798
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,369
YESOOL: Thanks for the coffee.

799
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:25,997
Hey, Yesool.

800
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,998
(sighs)

801
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,959
(sighs)

802
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,174
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR KIM YOONSOO

803
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:37,884
Yes?

804
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:42,680
It's nice and relaxing at Team 2,
isn't it?

805
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:46,475
We always get off on time
since we never win any bids.

806
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,854
(sucks air)
Hey.

807
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,775
Have you made any progress
with Cha Minhu since that night?

808
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,445
We'll talk later.

809
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,114
Dang it, I'm curious.

810
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,741
He demoted you
and sent you to another team

811
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,367
while you have a thing for each other.

812
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,494
I guess you could be confused.

813
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:06,871
It even confuses me now.

814
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,998
What's with that guy?

815
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,751
Be quiet. Come on. We're at work.

816
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,296
Just throw yourself at him.

817
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,506
-You know how I am, right?
-SUNHEE: Goodness.

818
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,383
What are you huddling around for?

819
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:27,558
Planning Team 1 did an ad
for Comfort Lingerie, right?

820
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,602
Can you get me the files on that?

821
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,229
Yes, will do.

822
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:34,023
And Eomji. You're always so busy

823
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,817
collaborating with others, huh?

824
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:38,569
Sorry? What do you...

825
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,695
(whispers)
Go.

826
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,164
-What did you just say?
-(Minhee sobs)

827
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,874
The weather was fine
when we were on the way here.

828
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,292
I guess it only rained here.

829
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,460
This is crazy.

830
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,921
Minhee, why didn't you check the weather?

831
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:00,299
(raising her voice)
I did check the weather forecast.

832
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:03,803
It's not raining now,
but the ground is a muddy mess.

833
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,389
We're supposed to film a driving car.
The muddy ground won't work!

834
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,099
The assistant director also double-checked

835
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,059
the weather forecast
and said it'd be fine.

836
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,644
It was a shower. Out of nowhere.

837
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,939
I know you can't help the weather.
I'm just saying, why didn't you check!

838
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,983
I'm saying this
because we have to shoot it today.

839
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:19,902
My god. What do I do?
Yesool isn't here, either.

840
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,153
(whining)
Ah, what do we do...

841
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,114
Damn it.

842
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:27,159
For now, I'll ask Director Lee

843
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:30,454
if we can revise the concept
and get back to you.

844
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,624
Well, all right. Let me figure
something out and call you back.

845
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:34,583
Bye.

846
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,546
Do we have to cancel the shoot?
I'm going crazy here. (sighs)

847
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,631
What's going on?

848
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,676
Ms. Hong. I'm going nuts.

849
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,885
What do I do?

850
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,387
What's wrong?

851
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,973
(Pilyo sighs)

852
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,142
PILYO:
Didn't you check the weather forecast?

853
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,687
ASSISTANT: I did.
But the shower came down out of nowhere.

854
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:56,564
What's Plan B then?

855
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:01,027
I'm sorry. We had to change
the location in a rush, so...

856
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,322
(sighing)
This is driving me nuts.

857
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,865
JIYOUNG: So...

858
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,702
Are we shooting or not?

859
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:14,498
This is why I hate working with amateurs.

860
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,834
Amateur?

861
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,837
You're an amateur in advertising.

862
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,506
This is your first commercial.

863
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,261
And you're making it so obvious
that it's your first time.

864
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,929
(Pilyo scoffs)

865
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,557
Wow, what you're saying is correct.
But you sure like to rub it in.

866
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,518
I said that intentionally to rub it in.

867
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:35,811
Ah...

868
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,856
I mean, play an old man,
someone bald and whatnot.

869
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,400
I ended up coming anyway
since I didn't have to do that.

870
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,152
(sighs)

871
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,445
But what the heck is this?

872
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,448
Hurry up and find another location.

873
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:49,533
Yes, will do.

874
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,245
I'm extremely sensitive right now

875
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,956
because I had to get up early
this morning to get my full makeup on.

876
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,834
I mean, this is for PPM
and not even for the actual commercial.

877
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,544
Even though I was so annoyed,
I still came.

878
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,671
But what is this?

879
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:03,923
(sighs deeply)

880
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:06,884
Hey, where's Minhu?

881
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,136
Excuse me? Oh, just a minute.

882
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,766
Will you finish shooting tonight?

883
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,227
Yes, it'll wrap up by midnight
at the latest.

884
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,228
(chuckles awkwardly)

885
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,564
I sent the official document
to the head office, so please check.

886
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,108
I trust you.

887
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:31,784
LOCATION MANAGER:
I've worked with you before, Mr. Cha.

888
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,745
Just clean up afterward
like you did last time.

889
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,455
-Thank you.
-Sure.

890
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,290
SANGGOO: Mr. Cha?

891
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,918
Oh, Mr. Cha!

892
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,963
Mr. Kang, how did you know to come here?

893
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,966
Ms. Hong told me. She said
it's the same place we shot the camera ad.

894
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,092
But...

895
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,303
you two worked together on that, right?

896
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,639
I suppose great minds think alike.

897
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,599
(laughs)

898
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,436
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN
OH SEUNGTAEK

899
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,104
TRAINING GROUP 3
NAME: BAN HOWOO

900
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,441
(smacking lips)

901
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,443
I'm sorry, sir!
(pants)

902
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:07,027
-(exhales deeply)
-Oh!

903
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,488
How do you do, Doctor?

904
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,075
(sighs)

905
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,078
BAN HOWOO

906
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:17,955
(tuts)

907
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:19,790
Ban Howoo.

908
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:23,669
The clinical training pre-test,
skills lab, CPX, and OSCE.

909
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,588
She ranked on top on all of them?

910
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,715
Yes. I heard
she's at the top of her class.

911
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,216
But also in this group.

912
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,513
(sighs)
Is this why?

913
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:37,975
She picks things up quickly.
She understands things fast too.

914
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,311
Speedy dating, speedy breakup.

915
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,730
So fast. So quick.
She does everything so fast.

916
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,192
Do you know Ban Howoo?

917
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,360
Huh?

918
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,488
No.

919
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,740
Let's do our rounds.

920
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,631
The chart.

921
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,801
Just a minute.

922
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,720
PATIENT MEDICAL RECORD

923
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,889
I know it was right here...

924
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,766
(inhales deeply)

925
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,685
It's glioma.

926
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,730
He got surgery three days ago,
and he felt rigid briefly after that.

927
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,274
But everything, including BP,
was normal last night.

928
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,527
(sighs)

929
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,737
Be sure to take care of your charts.

930
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,074
Must you get scolded
in front of these kids?

931
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,201
My apologies.

932
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,083
(Howoo clears throat)

933
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,335
(sighs)

934
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:48,879
Oh!

935
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:54,093
Where... did I see you?

936
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:55,636
What are you talking about?

937
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,725
(sucks air)

938
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,938
HOWOO: Jeez, this is crazy!

939
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,357
Why are they all here?

940
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,488
Doctor. Good evening.

941
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:16,991
(chuckles awkwardly)

942
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,243
Well, take care.

943
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:20,995
Hey, Ban Howoo.

944
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,915
Did you break up with me just to be here
as a student?

945
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,293
Hey.

946
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,670
How come everything is so easy for you?

947
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,797
Date for a week and then just drop me.

948
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,592
How long will you pretend not to know me?

949
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,012
Was I really nothing to you?

950
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,972
Did a week mean nothing to you?

951
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,223
(exhales deeply)

952
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,274
Why are you being so clingy?

953
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:53,068
Didn't we promise we'd do that
before we started dating?

954
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,363
We'd end up breaking up
when the chemistry between us is over.

955
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,073
If we break up when the dopamine runs out,

956
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,326
it's nice since
we'd only carry good memories with us.

957
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:01,493
Plus...

958
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:05,080
I may just be a student to you,

959
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,540
but becoming a doctor...

960
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,168
is in my lifetime bucket list.

961
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,963
Okay. Then what about me?

962
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,799
You were on my bucket list for the week.

963
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,969
I'm not interested in risking everything
on an unproductive relationship.

964
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:23,057
So don't act like you know me, Doctor.

965
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,143
Are you serious?

966
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,233
I'm asking one last time.
(sighs)

967
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,903
If that's what you want,

968
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,238
I'll treat you like a stranger
until the end.

969
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,407
(sighs)

970
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:41,533
Answer me.

971
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:46,914
Yes, Doctor.

972
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,625
I'll get going then.

973
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,669
(light music)

974
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:01,470
(sighs)

975
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,559
(sighs)

976
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,528
(deep inhale)

977
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,415
Cut, cut, cut.
(sighs)

978
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,251
Let's review this.

979
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,003
We'll review this!

980
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,463
Why did he say cut?

981
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,881
MANAGER: I thought it was good.

982
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,049
Play back.

983
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,676
Please play it back for him!

984
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,475
(sucks teeth)
I don't think this is working.

985
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:49,768
Let's take a break.

986
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,897
ASSISTANT: We'll take a break.

987
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,149
Have a seat, Jiyoung.

988
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,859
-Have a seat.
-Sit down and watch, Jiyoung.

989
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,319
-It looks good.
-Yeah, it's pretty good.

990
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:02,030
(clamoring)

991
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,369
(tuts)

992
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,163
(sighs deeply)

993
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:11,832
Don't you like their food?

994
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,586
You got up early this morning
to get your makeup done

995
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,338
and came all the way here
just to shoot a PPM video. You should eat.

996
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,716
I can't eat stuff like this.

997
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,094
I've never even been
to a place like this, either.

998
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,514
So why would you be sitting
at a place like this

999
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,057
when you can't even eat these things?

1000
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:30,684
(sighs)

1001
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,353
Where's Mr. Cha?

1002
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,106
I came because I heard he was coming.

1003
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,109
(coughs)
Oh, I know.

1004
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,112
I was also wondering where he was.

1005
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,739
He's not picking up, either.

1006
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,282
Maybe he went home first.

1007
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,451
Just try calling him.

1008
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:51,371
Mr. Cha doesn't usually join us
for gatherings.

1009
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:52,539
That's right.

1010
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,125
There's another person
who doesn't come to places like this.

1011
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,045
Mr. Cha and you seem
to have a lot in common.

1012
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,797
(chuckles)

1013
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,674
Director Lee.

1014
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,302
You don't like me, do you?

1015
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:09,348
No, I do like you.
You're Oh Jiyoung, the great actress.

1016
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,767
Since you're my model now, I'll try

1017
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,894
my best to like you
even if I don't, somehow.

1018
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,104
(scoffs)

1019
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:18,649
(gulps)

1020
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,612
Ms. Oh. I watched the monitor earlier,

1021
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,865
-and you were so beautiful on the screen.
-SANGGOO: Yes.

1022
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:29,576
So how was today's shoot? Was it okay?

1023
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,454
Was it tough for you since I'm an amateur?

1024
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,333
(snorts)
Director, you don't easily let go, huh?

1025
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,502
Oh! How did you know?

1026
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,255
I hold a grudge, and I'm petty.
I have a good memory too.

1027
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,965
I'm an amateur, you know.

1028
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,216
(scoffs)

1029
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:47,135
(Sanggoo laughing)
All right, guys. Cheers.

1030
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,513
-Let's have a toast. Your glass is empty.
-(Roma laughs)

1031
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:53,350
Cheers. Good work, everyone.
(laughs)

1032
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,688
What?

1033
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,481
They're already done.

1034
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,275
I shouldn't have come.

1035
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,202
What brings you here?

1036
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:17,124
Oh, I came to watch the shoot,
but they're done already.

1037
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,084
Did it go well?

1038
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,128
Everyone is having dinner nearby, right?

1039
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,589
I should go too.
I was craving a drink anyway.

1040
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,882
We still have something
to talk about, don't we?

1041
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:28,885
(sighs)

1042
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,020
Last night, you didn't give me an answer.

1043
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,106
Oh, that.

1044
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,234
I'll have to think about it some more.

1045
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,485
No, not that.

1046
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,072
You know what I'm talking about.

1047
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:51,867
Oh.

1048
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,622
So what happens to you and me?

1049
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,042
You saw it all.

1050
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,421
YESOOL: But I looked happy.

1051
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,215
It was my first time...

1052
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,635
seeing myself happy...

1053
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,804
in the future that I foresaw.

1054
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,143
(sighs)

1055
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,355
Can I really...

1056
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,025
believe this?

1057
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,785
MINHU: Were we happy?

1058
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,295
You said you saw our future.

1059
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,299
Were we really happy?

1060
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,134
I don't know

1061
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:55,389
if the future I saw is really true,

1062
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:59,142
or if I remember it wrong
because I was too drunk that night.

1063
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,275
You want to see it again?

1064
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:12,406
You can double-check.

1065
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,703
Why? Are you scared?

1066
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,956
The fact that I'm in your future?

1067
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:23,667
No.

1068
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:30,090
This time, you suggested it first.

1069
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,136
(light music)

1070
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,858
Oh, you're up.
Go sit over there. Don't come.

1071
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,359
No, go over there.

1072
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,445
I want to look cool to you.

1073
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,239
(romantic music)

1074
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,831
(romantic music continues)

1075
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,754
MINHU: Did you see it?

1076
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,261
(romantic music continues)

1077
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,395
(romantic music continues)

1078
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:32,128
(romantic music fades)

1079
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:38,885
So what happens to us
in the future that you foresee?

1080
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,138
Huh?

1081
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,232
Shall we start dating?

1082
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,194
(cheerful music)

1083
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,988
As you said, Mr. Cha...

1084
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,824
let's date.

1085
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,999
(closing theme music)
