1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,378
(sighs)
Let's do it.

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:04,963
Pardon?

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,256
Let's do it.

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,597
Tonight is good.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,725
But I have one condition.

6
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,604
Condition?

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:23,815
What condition?

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,193
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,786
(theme music)

10
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,963
What were you guys talking about?

11
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,798
What was the deal you two
were about to make?

12
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,008
Minhu.

13
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,552
-What condition? What is it?
-Get in.

14
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,346
What were you guys talking about?

15
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,599
You can't just come in and out of here
when you want to.

16
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,767
You keep ignoring my texts. That's why.

17
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,645
Did you forget our dinner plans tonight?

18
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,230
Jeez, I never said I'd go.

19
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,233
-I never said you didn't have to come.
-Is your manager on the first floor?

20
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:51,111
I mean, Minhu,
why do you always work late with her?

21
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,612
You even let her in your place.

22
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,198
Are you two seeing each other? Is that it?

23
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,742
Stop talking nonsense.

24
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,909
(sighs)

25
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,246
(tuts)
Does Hong Yesool know about your secret?

26
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,250
Would she still go out with you

27
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,252
even if she knew your secret?

28
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,382
I know everything about you,
so it doesn't matter.

29
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,886
But would any other woman
go out with you if they knew?

30
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,138
(inhales)
Minhu.

31
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,724
(sighs)
I'm the only one

32
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,559
who can understand you.

33
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,853
(light music)

34
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:29,983
(exhales sharply)

35
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,863
(sighing)

36
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,615
(exhales deeply)

37
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,576
(sighs)

38
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,995
(sighs deeply)

39
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,706
(footsteps approaching)

40
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,633
Well...

41
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,469
are you going out with Ms. Oh Jiyoung?

42
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,264
Would that change our future?

43
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:04,893
No.

44
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,980
So getting back
to what we were talking about earlier,

45
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,692
what kind of condition
are you talking about...

46
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,030
(sighs deeply)

47
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,744
Why do you always stare at me like that?

48
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,288
Tell me what the deal is.

49
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,338
Never mind. Let's talk again tomorrow.

50
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,715
Well...

51
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,219
(sighs deeply)

52
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,433
(sighs)

53
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,815
(sighs deeply)

54
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,109
Would she still go out with you

55
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,778
even if she knew your secret?

56
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,157
(dramatic music)

57
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,419
What happened
to the Mopix contract renewal?

58
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,215
Well, you said their additional terms
were too strict

59
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,595
and you didn't want it. So I believe
the President turned it down. Why?

60
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,055
Where's the President right now?

61
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,141
Just a second.

62
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,853
(sighs)

63
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,736
(exhales deeply)

64
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,368
(suspenseful music)

65
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,343
(siren blaring)

66
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,806
(gunshots)

67
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,187
(siren blaring continues)

68
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,653
(exhales deeply)

69
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,659
(chuckles)

70
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,915
(grunts)

71
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,221
You're so transparent.

72
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,309
How could you mix work
and personal feelings?

73
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,144
What do you mean?

74
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,771
I can tell right off the bat.

75
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,148
By your facial expression,
your gaze. I know it all.

76
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,317
Here's the evidence.

77
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,444
ZEU AD too.

78
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,948
You asked us to get you
all the information on Planning Team 1,

79
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,367
except for Ms. Hong Yesool.

80
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,703
Do you think we can tell or not?

81
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,748
Every time you drink, you're
always saying, "Hong Yesool, Yesool."

82
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,792
(sighs)
My goodness.

83
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,085
Huh?

84
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,378
But...

85
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,339
isn't the "Reunion" script
about that, too?

86
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,842
(sucks air)
It's obviously an epilogue to "Haroo."

87
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,594
With all your wishful thinking.

88
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,471
TITLE: REUNION

89
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,307
You think so?

90
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,142
Does it seem like that?

91
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,771
Wow, but how did you finish
this in three days?

92
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,607
(exclaims)
As expected.

93
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,609
What?

94
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,069
Did you really write about
your own wishful thinking?

95
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,864
(sighing)
Let's just unpack.

96
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,283
(sighs)

97
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,662
You have to be here alone for a while.
I'm so worried.

98
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,749
Oh, right. Did you hear that?

99
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,959
Our neighbor, two doors down,
was robbed during the day.

100
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,085
My gosh.

101
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,922
So make sure you lock up the place
at all times.

102
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,845
What the heck? Are you listening to me?

103
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:14,184
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
Make sure you eat well.

104
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,021
-And take care of your health.
-(Howoo scoffs)

105
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,106
Yesool, why are you saying
such an obvious thing

106
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,316
when you don't even mean it?

107
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,235
It looks like something's up. Huh?

108
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:26,780
What is it?

109
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,491
What is it?
Tell me what happened. Spill it.

110
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,617
Hurry.

111
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,370
Gosh.

112
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:34,954
(whispers)

113
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,164
(gasps)

114
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,124
Cha Minhu suggested you sleep together?

115
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,836
Cha Minhu, he's totally nuts.

116
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,046
No.

117
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,173
I suggested it first.

118
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,092
Then you're a crazy bitch.

119
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,343
Gosh. Hey.

120
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,679
You told me to sleep with him
and get it over with.

121
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,139
That's right. I did, didn't I?

122
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,599
I'm the crazy bitch.

123
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,142
(quirky music)

124
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,103
So? When are you going to sleep with him?

125
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,148
Well, he said anytime would be fine.

126
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,566
Wow!

127
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,319
But then he suddenly said
there's a condition.

128
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,738
A condition? What condition?

129
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,074
(gasps)
Does he like it a certain way?

130
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,034
Does he want to do it not once
but at least twice?

131
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,160
My gosh!

132
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,995
(sighs)

133
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,206
What could be that condition?

134
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,167
(sucks air)
Wait.

135
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,254
I think I've seen something
like this before.

136
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,009
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.

137
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,184
Ta-da!

138
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,102
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY

139
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,646
Are you crazy?

140
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,232
What? It's totally possible.

141
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,776
Who knows?

142
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,032
(light music)

143
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,377
(gasps)

144
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,965
(footsteps approaching)

145
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,350
(Minhu laughs)

146
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,020
(shouts)

147
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,356
(moans in pain)

148
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,444
(sighs)

149
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,824
Let us enjoy and satisfy my fetish.

150
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,326
SLAVE CONTRACT

151
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,494
Seriously...

152
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,620
(giggles)

153
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,331
S&M? Role play?

154
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,417
-You want to do this?
-We're adults here!

155
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,002
What's wrong with role-playing?

156
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,754
Well, role-playing...

157
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,756
That's too much.

158
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,299
And playing with sex toys.

159
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,717
Is that possible?

160
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:53,718
That's nothing.

161
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,555
I want to do it outdoors too.
(laughs)

162
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,059
(laughing continues)

163
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,312
Gosh, no way!

164
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,522
Hey.

165
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,066
He may have a nasty temper,
but he's not a pervert.

166
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,400
(scoffs)
Yesool.

167
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,820
You said he always keeps his word, right?

168
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,198
He has good business ethics, precise,
intelligent, and thorough with his work.

169
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,118
Lots of guys like that are pervs.

170
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,579
Gosh, that can't be.

171
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,374
I'd rather...

172
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,418
(light music)

173
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,261
-What are we doing here...
-I've already made an appointment.

174
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,346
You just need to go in
and run a few tests.

175
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,597
What tests?

176
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,933
I think this is showing courtesy
to each other.

177
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,311
Let's do it after making sure we're clean
and don't have any medical issues.

178
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,730
These are my test results.

179
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,654
(Minhu laughs)

180
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,785
Mmm! That's not bad.

181
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,372
That's about having manners
and etiquette toward one another.

182
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,040
If that's his condition,

183
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,042
I'd say he's kind of a nice guy.

184
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,670
Jeez, forget it.

185
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,589
My head hurts more when I talk to you.

186
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,299
Just pack your things already.

187
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,010
Did you pack your battery charger
and adapter?

188
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:17,927
Huh?

189
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,890
(gasps)
Oh, right. Thank you.

190
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,725
My goodness. Seriously.

191
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,856
(sighs)

192
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,275
(sighs deeply)

193
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,819
(moans in frustration)

194
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,158
The key concept that I recommend
is "Reunion."

195
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,370
A couple fell madly in love in their 20s
but had to part ways for some reason.

196
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,248
Then one day, they reunite in their 70s
and live happily ever after.

197
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,543
The whole story revolves
around a Mopix V9.

198
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,587
Like in a parallel universe concept.

199
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,465
What does a reunion have to do with Mopix?

200
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,385
Just like Mopix's long history,
I'm sure many people have experienced

201
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,930
the process of meeting, parting
and then reuniting with Mopix.

202
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,473
Despite that, I want to emphasize

203
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,267
that what ultimately remains
is Mopix in the end.

204
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,477
That sounds really good.

205
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,146
Don't sentimental stories
like this sell these days?

206
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,440
-Mm-hmm.
-In such a short amount of time.

207
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,691
I respect you for that.

208
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,444
Who do you think would be a good model?

209
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,322
I'd like to find someone
from everyday people.

210
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,365
Ah.

211
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,617
This says Oh Jiyoung is the model.

212
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,995
OH JIYOUNG, MOPIX'S MUSE, CONTRACT RENEWED

213
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,379
Please explain how this happened.

214
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,506
First of all, let me apologize.

215
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,051
We should've called you first
and explained the situation.

216
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,887
I'm sorry you had to find out
from an article.

217
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,223
It's not like I don't know
how things go in this field.

218
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,183
I totally understand the situation.

219
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,311
But my storyboards and Oh Jiyoung
aren't compatible.

220
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,854
I can't work with that actress.

221
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,858
I'm sorry, Director Lee,
but we can't change the model.

222
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,902
How can you say that right now?

223
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,530
Don't you even have an intention
to make an effort?

224
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,492
I believe open and frank communication
is important at times like this.

225
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,745
Mopix wanted to renew their contract
with Ms. Oh Jiyoung.

226
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:08,705
(Pilyo sighs)

227
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,039
Based on my conversation
with them this morning,

228
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,457
I don't think they'll reconsider.

229
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,709
(sighs deeply)

230
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,670
(sighs)

231
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,257
(exhales deeply)

232
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,928
Creating good advertising campaigns
is an important part of our job,

233
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,056
but our priority is to create campaigns
that our clients want.

234
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,224
(scoffs)

235
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,185
I wouldn't have signed on with you
had I known this would happen.

236
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,855
But you've already signed on with us.

237
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,567
(scoffs)

238
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,820
Whoa, this is how you stab
someone in the back.

239
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,572
Instead, we'll stick to your storyboards

240
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,158
and minimize the number of revisions
as much as possible

241
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,494
so things proceed the way
you originally intended.

242
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,872
Our team will do our best
to support you in that.

243
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,957
Our team is very competent.

244
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,500
Please count on us.

245
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,919
I mean, how do you plan on supporting me?

246
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,796
Can you just plug someone in there?

247
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,715
I was thinking of someone in their 70s.

248
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,301
Are you going to put special effects
makeup on Oh Jiyoung or what?

249
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,136
How do you plan to do that?

250
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,306
Shouldn't you get Ms. Oh's approval first?

251
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:13,436
If you insist,
I'll persuade Ms. Oh Jiyoung.

252
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,937
Bravo.

253
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,441
-You really are going to persuade her?
-Yes.

254
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,068
Even though it's someone
with gray hair and bald?

255
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,196
We'll hire the best special effects
makeup team.

256
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,531
For your information,
it's supposed to be an old man.

257
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:29,410
Ms. Oh had portrayed a role of a woman
dressed up as a man in a movie before.

258
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,037
I'm sure she can pull it off just fine.

259
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,291
But would people want to see Oh Jiyoung
dressed up as an old man?

260
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,003
If that's what you want,
we'll make it happen.

261
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,297
Please tell me
if there's anything else you want.

262
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,591
(sighs)

263
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,093
By the way,

264
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,805
I thought the storyboards you sent me
were about two lovers reuniting.

265
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,057
When did it change to an old man concept?

266
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,352
(sighs)

267
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,564
I think this is enough.

268
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:03,027
Why don't we talk like professionals
from now on?

269
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,406
(sighs)

270
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,491
(scoffs)

271
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,330
(chuckles)

272
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,999
I think it was my third year as an AE.

273
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,459
The day before
the Juno Automobile's commercial

274
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,460
was released, the model got arrested.

275
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,504
For what? For drunk driving.

276
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,172
It was a car commercial,
and he got caught drunk driving.

277
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,466
-So what could I do?
-So what happened?

278
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,593
What else could we do?
We had to shoot it again.

279
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,804
There are so many variables in this field.

280
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,640
But I love Oh Jiyoung.

281
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,852
If we change the model,

282
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,812
so many things have to change
in the proposal.

283
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,939
All the late hours we put in are reset

284
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,941
and we have
to start all over again working late.

285
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,610
(sighs)
We still get paid overtime, though.

286
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:45,945
That's true.

287
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,363
By the way, where did Yesool go?

288
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,700
(sighs deeply)

289
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,832
Let's talk for a minute.

290
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,671
I had no idea ZEU AD would work this way.

291
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,132
I'm learning a life lesson here
once again.

292
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,135
I'll be sure to remember
to put this in my next contract.

293
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,597
We're very sorry
about how things went as well.

294
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,556
(sighs)

295
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,518
I'm sure you've discussed this
with Mr. Cha, so let's talk about work.

296
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,230
What's this?

297
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,734
I've written down some ways
to reduce the number of revisions.

298
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,737
Do you think we can meet
the deadline this way?

299
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,238
We'll have to make it happen.

300
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,365
I'll see you at the next meeting.

301
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,659
We've talked enough about work.

302
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,662
Shouldn't we finish talking about us now?

303
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,123
You still haven't

304
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,667
answered to my suggestion yet.

305
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,881
I need more time to think about it.

306
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,931
(sighs)

307
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,105
(clears throat)

308
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:07,318
Director Lee, I know you're not
in a good mood today.

309
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,861
(inhales deeply)

310
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,323
Here's a list of interview questions
for today. Please review them beforehand.

311
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,620
(sighs)

312
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:25,544
Director Lee, this is your last interview.
Please do your best.

313
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,840
I always do.
But the questions aren't the best.

314
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,802
I don't want to give the same answers
to every interview either.

315
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,389
Oh, my. Aren't you Director Lee Pilyo?

316
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,641
-Huh? Where?
-(crowd gasps)

317
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,393
I actually saw a sign

318
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,688
that said, "Talk with Director Lee Pilyo"
at the entrance earlier.

319
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,524
(chuckles)
But I didn't expect to see you here.

320
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,610
Oh, I was invited to the premiere.

321
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,491
But the movie was too boring,
so I walked out.

322
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,120
But they said my presence alone
would be a good promo.

323
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,373
(chuckling awkwardly)
I see.

324
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,625
You read the article, right?

325
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,127
I'm so honored.

326
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,338
I've wanted to work
with you, Director Lee.

327
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,382
And this is how we connect.

328
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,553
Well, we'll have to see if it turns out
to be a good thing or a bad thing.

329
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,138
Sorry?

330
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,475
Mr. Cha told you
what kind of concept it is, right?

331
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,479
Well, I can work with any concept.

332
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,232
That's why people say
I'm "Perfect Actress,"

333
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,401
"Every Character, Role of a Lifetime"

334
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,903
and "Every Moment is Her Peak, A Legend."

335
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,072
(smacking lips)
I'm sure you've heard them all, right?

336
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,366
So you're sure you can play any role?

337
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,119
-Of course.
-(sucks air)

338
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,038
I think it could be
a little difficult, though.

339
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,664
Hmm, no, no, no.

340
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,416
There is no way.

341
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,918
The character is seventy-something.

342
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,173
Excuse me?

343
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,134
And for your information, it's an old man.

344
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,552
What?

345
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,056
(chuckles)
Director Lee, it's almost time.

346
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,351
Oh, it's almost time for my interview.
See you next time.

347
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,480
Oh, Director!

348
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,398
(clamoring)

349
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,819
Hey, did I just mishear him?

350
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:14,945
An old man?

351
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,490
(stuttering)
No. I think that's what I heard too.

352
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,326
(gasps)
Hey.

353
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,078
Call the President right now!

354
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,204
Oh, okay.

355
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,622
(sighs)

356
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,794
(sighs)

357
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,174
MINHU: Thank you.

358
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,052
(slurps)

359
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,804
Are you traumatized over this?

360
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,223
It's not the first time
something like this has happened.

361
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,474
No.

362
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,060
I've already given Director Lee
a revised proposal.

363
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,561
I'm totally fine.

364
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,272
Really?

365
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,692
Then is it me?

366
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,111
Going back to what
we were talking about last night.

367
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,738
Let me ask you one thing.

368
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,990
(stuttering)
What... what... what about it?

369
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,911
(sucks air)
Is it the future you saw the reason

370
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,371
you want to sleep with me?

371
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,250
Well, yes.

372
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,962
To be honest,
I spend most of my time with you.

373
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,755
Ever since seeing our future,

374
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,843
I feel like suffocating
every time I see you at work or off-site.

375
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,845
I just want to be at ease.

376
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,682
Then,

377
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,101
after sleeping with me,

378
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,854
do you think you'll be at ease?
Do you think that'll happen?

379
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,066
-Yes.
-Really?

380
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:35,985
Yes.

381
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,281
Fine. Then come over to my place tonight.

382
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,657
Okay.

383
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,827
(sucks air)

384
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,330
(quirky music)

385
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,335
(breathes nervously)

386
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,173
(pants)

387
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,467
Calm down, Hong Yesool.

388
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,343
No need to be in shock.
(breathes deeply)

389
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,971
This is what you wanted.
(gasps)

390
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,514
But this soon?

391
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,434
This is going too fast.
(gasps)

392
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,061
No. You wanted to get it over with.

393
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,731
It's better to get it over with.

394
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,318
(breathing roughly)
It's all right. I'll be fine.

395
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,992
By the way,
I'm not wearing nice lingerie...

396
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,119
Huh?

397
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,414
Wait a minute.

398
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,211
(romantic music)

399
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,471
(light music)

400
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,744
And what's next?

401
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,705
Next?

402
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,709
You took off your dress shirt...

403
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,922
What were you doing
while I was doing that?

404
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,925
I... I was getting undressed too.

405
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:25,928
That can't be.

406
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,722
-Sorry?
-I usually undress them.

407
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,102
Well, ma... maybe we were in a rush.

408
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,020
We're that into each other?

409
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:36,689
(inhales deeply)

410
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,858
So, we get undressed.

411
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,818
And after that...

412
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,072
Did you kiss me first?

413
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,534
-Well.
-(grunts)

414
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,619
What does that matter?

415
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,329
Of course, it matters.

416
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:56,834
I need to know how we progress,
so I can figure out how I feel that day.

417
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:01,088
It has nothing to do with your feelings.
It just happens because we are drunk.

418
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,048
So what you're saying is

419
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:07,261
we rushed into the bedroom
from the entrance kissing nonstop.

420
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,763
(sucks air)
Man, I just don't get it.

421
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,267
What don't you get?

422
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,813
I'd never act emotionally like that
no matter how drunk I am.

423
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,649
How many times do I have to tell you?

424
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,943
Neither one of us was in our right mind.

425
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:27,281
Even though a pot broke,
we came in here in a flash.

426
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,949
Break what?

427
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,409
A potted plant.

428
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,369
Jackson?

429
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,414
This one.

430
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,709
That broke? Really?

431
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,127
Yes.

432
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,837
Is it something you treasure?

433
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,590
I don't get it.

434
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,052
I broke Jackson,
yet I still went into the bedroom?

435
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,513
No way.

436
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:56,226
What do you mean?
Are you suggesting that I'm lying?

437
00:23:56,644 --> 00:24:01,148
I'll say it again.
You were the one who pushed me this way.

438
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,984
That means you broke it.

439
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,527
That's right.

440
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,863
Then shall we put it somewhere else
just in case?

441
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,698
-Jackson. Jackson?
-Yeah.

442
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,701
-Be careful.
-Oh. Let's go.

443
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,746
Oh, put it there.

444
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,499
-Yes. No, no. More to the right.
-To the right...

445
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,044
(shatters)

446
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,171
(shouts)

447
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,298
(moans in shock)

448
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,259
(moans in shock)

449
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,222
(gasps)

450
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,391
-Oh.
-(moans in shock)

451
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,350
Well...

452
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,310
(moans in shock)

453
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,693
I'm sorry.

454
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,737
I'll get you the same thing.

455
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,572
This thing came across the ocean.

456
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,033
There were only two in the country.

457
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:57,329
Oh. Well...
(sighs)

458
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,332
(sighs)

459
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,753
Forget it. Don't worry about it.

460
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,797
It's not the first time
you have broken something.

461
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,302
(sighs)

462
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,225
I prepared this just in case.

463
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:32,197
That event is going to happen
and so I believe we need to be prepared

464
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,826
for potential problems that may arise
after the event.

465
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,371
ARTICLE 3 (CONFIDENTIALITY)

466
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:43,208
I want to continue to work with you.

467
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,711
To be able to see each other even after...

468
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,796
Let me ask you one last question.

469
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,259
That day. In the future you saw,

470
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,678
how did I look at you?

471
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,891
(light music)

472
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:10,694
Are you sure we slept together
because we got drunk?

473
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,535
Judging from various circumstances,
that seems to be the most likely scenario.

474
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:24,041
But I never have one-night stands
just because I'm drunk.

475
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:29,838
If I do sleep with you in the future,
that's probably because I'm dating you.

476
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,423
That's probably why I'd sleep with you.

477
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,259
I don't sleep with a woman
I'm not interested in.

478
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:40,432
So, go out with me
if you want to sleep with me.

479
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,314
That's my condition.

480
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,299
What a crazy bastard.

481
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,979
What a crazy bastard.

482
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,569
What a crazy bastard.

483
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,120
What a crazy bastard.

484
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,872
Shit.

485
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:57,342
(sighs)
This is driving me crazy.

486
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,263
(whines)

487
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,268
What a crazy bastard. That crazy bastard.

488
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,771
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

489
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,273
I apologize.

490
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,776
I was on call through the night
for the last two nights. So I dozed off.

491
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,654
I was supposed to transfer the patient
to the surgery department, but you...

492
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:21,241
It's all right. I understand
you're losing sleep these days.

493
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,369
-(laughs)
-I won't run away this time.

494
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,330
If I run away again
after scheduling a surgery...

495
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,457
It happens. It happens.

496
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,542
I never ran away like you
when I was a resident.

497
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,419
But I'm sure I wanted to.

498
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,839
And the fact that
I'm going out with someone

499
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,051
-is all thanks to you, man.
-Oh.

500
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,053
-(laughs)
-I heard you're seeing someone?

501
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,387
You look very happy.

502
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,306
Hey, hey, guys.

503
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,601
Even though your residency is tough,
don't stop dating.

504
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,978
You're not supposed to.

505
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,689
More exhausted your life is,
you should date someone

506
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,901
and energize your life, you know?

507
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,569
You can take a break, man.

508
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,237
-Stop clubbing, punk.
-(chuckles)

509
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,614
How long have you been together?

510
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,741
It's been about a week.
(chuckles)

511
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,117
Wow, it's so dynamic.

512
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,036
(chuckles)

513
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,079
Oh!

514
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,705
Did you just hear that sound?

515
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,123
-(both exclaim)
-Huh?

516
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,417
-(all exclaim)
-Is it my baby?

517
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,335
(laughs)

518
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,294
ALARM BREAKUP D-1

519
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,295
Huh?

520
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,631
What's this?

521
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,843
Why does it have to be a week?

522
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,387
(sighs deeply)

523
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,514
A day is too short.

524
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,558
But if it's longer, we'll end up
showing each other our pathetic sides.

525
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,102
So just one week.

526
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,688
I want to show only my best side,
cherish the good memories,

527
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,272
and say goodbye.

528
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,608
But still, a week is too short.

529
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,860
All right.
Then let's just say goodbye here.

530
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,153
No!

531
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,323
I'm sorry.

532
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,327
All right. Fine. A week? Okay.

533
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,745
BREAKUP D-1

534
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,205
Whoa...

535
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,457
Was she serious?

536
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,585
(sucks air)
Or was she joking?

537
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,423
For real?

538
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,800
I don't think so. Was it a joke?

539
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:03,969
(sighs)

540
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,722
Excuse me for a second.

541
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,766
BREAKUP D-7

542
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,560
Whoa...

543
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,938
I think she meant it.

544
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,695
(chomping)

545
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,826
Howoo, shall we go to Brooks this weekend?

546
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,786
It's a hot spot these days.

547
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,497
Huh? Isn't that on the underground level
of ZEU AD building?

548
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,291
Oh! Have you been there?

549
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,294
Yeah, my cousin works there,
so I've only seen it.

550
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,962
Your cousin works there?

551
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,506
A friend of mine works there too.
He's a planning team chief.

552
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,967
Huh? A planning team chief?

553
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,093
Yeah.

554
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,512
What's his name?

555
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,393
Mr. Cha. Well...

556
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,104
Director Lee wants to rewrite the proposal

557
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,315
since the model has been changed
to Oh Jiyoung.

558
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,318
He wants more time.
He says he won't be ready by the PPM.

559
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,945
All of the locations
are out of the country,

560
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,490
a nature reserve,
or an airport during the day.

561
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,742
It will be tough even to attempt
to scout the location...

562
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,869
It looks like Director Lee is

563
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,955
quite offended by what happened
the other day.

564
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:20,462
He did say he needs more time
as he cannot meet the deadline.

565
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,757
But I think it's more about being upset
rather than a scheduling issue.

566
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,592
I'll talk to him again.

567
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,179
(sighs deeply)

568
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,430
(tuts)

569
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,974
We can't put off the PPM.

570
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,728
Either go through our previous proposals
or come up with new ideas.

571
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,897
Let's schedule another meeting
with concept boards.

572
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,028
(stuttering)
Yes, sir.

573
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,921
(moans)

574
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,422
(sighs)

575
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,635
The production team gave us feedback
on our storyboards,

576
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,679
so I'm on my way to meet with them.

577
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:15,725
Mr. Cha.

578
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,854
I thought about what you said last night.

579
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,898
I don't think I can say yes.

580
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,150
Is that so?

581
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,651
Yes.

582
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,280
Of all people, you and me...

583
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,323
I can't imagine it.

584
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,910
Okay, I guess I understand.

585
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,830
(sighs)

586
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:37,998
Oh, right.

587
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,125
Did you remember what you saw that night?

588
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,920
The future you saw
when we kissed in my car.

589
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,964
You still don't remember?

590
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,175
(laughs awkwardly)

591
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,719
I was so drunk that night.

592
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,889
I must have drunk too much.

593
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,390
(sucks air)

594
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,434
Can you really foresee the future?

595
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,685
Sorry?

596
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:02,480
Come to think of it, the location
for the test drive is easy to tell

597
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,901
and you broke my cellphone screen.
Didn't you make that happen?

598
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,652
Say what?

599
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,738
Why would I do such a thing?

600
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,822
I wouldn't know.

601
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,073
To get my attention?

602
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,035
You're interested in me, right?

603
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,411
What?

604
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:20,874
Aren't you getting out?

605
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,084
I still have some time.

606
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,795
(upbeat music)

607
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,930
As you know,
this is my first car ad campaign.

608
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,057
How would I know a place for a test drive?

609
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,645
Besides, didn't Director Lee take us there
spontaneously, to begin with?

610
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,687
Your cellphone too.

611
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,106
All right. All right.
Don't get so worked up.

612
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,316
I just threw it out there.

613
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,819
I mean, what you just said
doesn't make sense.

614
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,572
Hey, how come so many things
don't make sense to you?

615
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,241
It doesn't make sense for you to like me

616
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,326
and it doesn't make sense
for us to date, either?

617
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,162
Then, do you think
it makes sense, Mr. Cha?

618
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,247
Why doesn't it make sense?

619
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,375
We're both single.
You're not seeing anyone, are you?

620
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,294
Well, what makes you think I'm single?

621
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,671
Then do you have someone?

622
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,547
If you have someone,

623
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,299
why would you work late
or pull all-nighters

624
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,968
or have a one-night stand with me?

625
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:17,138
(quirky music)

626
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,106
LEE PILYO

627
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,066
Hello?

628
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,527
I received the revised proposal
with a checklist in the email.

629
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,362
Are you sure you fully understand
my concept?

630
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,530
Not only the model,

631
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,532
but do I have to change the locations
to meet your budget?

632
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,118
Let's discuss that in person.

633
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,869
I'll set up a meeting right away.

634
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:45,709
And about your suggestion for us
to go on three dates last time.

635
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,044
Fine.

636
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,131
Let's do that.

637
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,134
(cell phone beeps)

638
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,178
(quirky music)

639
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,153
What did they say?

640
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,408
Wait, what now? Did he say no again?

641
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,995
Wow, they have no manners
in the ad industry.

642
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,956
They can't adjust the schedule
while bringing up the contract again?

643
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,458
Set up a meeting right away.

644
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,419
Let's not go easy on them this time.

645
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,339
They must think
they can just push us around.

646
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,633
Let's go over tomorrow
and have it out with them.

647
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:35,800
We can't.

648
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:37,677
What?

649
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,471
I have to go on dates.

650
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,726
I'm going to get my haircut.

651
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,935
What? Director.

652
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,563
Okay.

653
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,232
(groans in frustration)

654
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,817
(sighs)

655
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,194
(groans)

656
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,948
(exhales deeply)

657
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,076
I must've been crazy. I just lost it.

658
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,160
Haejin.

659
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,828
Why am I still alive?

660
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,624
It's all right. You needed to hash it out
with Pilyo once and for all, anyhow.

661
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,251
(sighs)
I do need to.

662
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:14,714
But I didn't have to set that up
in front of Cha Minhu.

663
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,258
I'm consistently out of my mind
these days.

664
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,094
I think I need to see a doctor.

665
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,011
Don't be silly.

666
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,513
You have to do things
to make you want to drink,

667
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,057
so that small business owners
like me can survive. You did well.

668
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,142
Haejin.

669
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:29,312
In any case, why do you care
about Cha Minhu all of a sudden?

670
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:32,440
What does your date with Pilyo
have anything to do with Cha Minhu?

671
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:35,193
You're acting like you like Cha Minhu.

672
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,236
Haejin!

673
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,779
Now that I hear you out, he's not so bad.

674
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,240
You said he's successful
and well-respected in the industry.

675
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,535
Gosh, you say that
because you don't know him.

676
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,328
Not so bad, my ass!

677
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,664
Perhaps you don't know him.

678
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,500
What you see isn't everything in a person.

679
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:51,918
(sighs)

680
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,046
(slurps)

681
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,423
(moans in frustration)

682
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,267
Oh, it smells good.
(laughs softly)

683
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,026
(sucks air)

684
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,946
The pain usually lasted
for a few days, didn't it?

685
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,907
(sucks air)
That's odd.

686
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:26,327
-Any other symptoms since then?
-No.

687
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,538
I briefly lost consciousness,

688
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,540
but I was fine when I woke up.

689
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,793
(clears throat)
That lady.

690
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,087
Are you seeing her?

691
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:37,922
Oh.

692
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,759
She's just my subordinate at work.

693
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,637
(chuckles)
Okay. Okay. It's your personal life.

694
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:45,764
(sucks air)

695
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:50,435
Your medication started
to have a strain on your brain function

696
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:55,106
and if you rely on drugs too much,
it could cause brain dysfunction.

697
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,610
Anyway, I think it's a good sign.

698
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,112
Your hearing is the most sensitive
among your five senses.

699
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,948
It must be very painful
to hear all kinds of sounds,

700
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,408
whether you like them or not.

701
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:09,704
So try to focus on the sounds
you want to hear.

702
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,998
The sounds I want to hear?

703
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,543
For example,
the voice of the woman you love.

704
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,962
Like her heartbeat or her nagging voice.

705
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:22,592
You have to find ways to control
your senses on your own like that.

706
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,931
What? Come on, you two.

707
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,474
Without me?

708
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,019
(chuckles)
Dad!

709
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,688
Why didn't you tell me
that Minhu was coming over?

710
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,982
You two are so mean.

711
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,151
You had to work today.

712
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,861
And Minhu wouldn't come if you were here.

713
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,571
Minhu, is that true?

714
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,699
I mean, you wouldn't even answer my calls.

715
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,453
Are you mad because of the ad?

716
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,788
Did you cause trouble again?

717
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,166
I mean, Mopix wants me. What can I do?

718
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,298
All right. I'll take care of it.

719
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,468
Lee Pilyo is a bit particular,

720
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,637
but I've dealt with so many directors.

721
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,305
Just count on me.

722
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,100
Come on, Minhu.

723
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,270
-I'll take care of it, okay? Minhu.
-Thank you for the food.

724
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,480
I'll stay in touch, Doctor.

725
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:20,233
See? Minhu is leaving because you're here.

726
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,693
Minhu!

727
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,195
Are you really mad at me?

728
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,158
If you keep ignoring me like this,

729
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,578
I'm going to be a real pain on set.

730
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,540
You like Hong Yesool, don't you?

731
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,004
Jeez...

732
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,424
Why did you stop at that question?

733
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,592
Why else?

734
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,719
My goodness.

735
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,971
I've told you a thousand times.

736
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,098
That you're like a younger sister to me.

737
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,266
(sighs)

738
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,311
I've told you a thousand times.

739
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,896
That I'm not your younger sister.

740
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,774
Check my family register.
I don't have an older brother.

741
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,068
See you at the meeting.

742
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,114
If you keep this up,
I'll tell Hong Yesool everything!

743
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,537
What the hell.

744
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,415
(whines)
You turned around again.

745
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,667
Jeez.

746
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,086
What now? What?

747
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,922
Does that scare you?

748
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,131
(sighs)

749
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,300
Don't you dare ignore my calls.

750
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,135
I'll tell her right away.

751
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:31,846
(sighs)

752
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,223
(whines)

753
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,941
(sighs)

754
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,209
(sighs deeply)

755
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,971
Were there any changes in your body
after the accident?

756
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:16,516
(breathes nervously)
I can see everything too well.

757
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,353
And everything is so loud.

758
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,064
(breathes nervously)
It feels like

759
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,151
everyone is talking in my ear.

760
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,905
(sucks air)
Can you elaborate?

761
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,997
(ominous music)

762
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,419
Weird things keep popping out.

763
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,753
No.

764
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,213
(breathes roughly)

765
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,259
Everything is too loud.

766
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,886
I sometimes faint...

767
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,889
(pants)

768
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,933
...and have a nagging headache.

769
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,059
(whimpers)

770
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:09,736
MINHU: And my heart is beating like crazy.

771
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,949
That's called sensory overload
or information overload.

772
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:18,745
Your five senses are several times
more enhanced than other people.

773
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,832
(breathes roughly)
Then what do I do now?

774
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,377
Do I have to live with this?
(inhales)

775
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,838
You'll be fine if you learn
to control your senses.

776
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,632
You can also get some technical help.

777
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:35,386
Of course, I'll help you too.

778
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,098
(sighs)

779
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,975
(breathes nervously)

780
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,269
(dramatic music)

781
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,113
OH SEUNGTAEK

782
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,323
Hey.

783
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,619
(upbeat music)

784
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,297
Can you explain what's going on?

785
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,216
Sure, I'll explain.

786
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:14,634
This is my honey.

787
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,637
She said she wanted
to meet you, so I brought her here.

788
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,263
Oh, that honey?

789
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,515
SEUNGTAEK: Yeah.
(laughs)

790
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,141
How do you like it in bed?

791
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,103
Honey, you haven't even asked me that...

792
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,355
Oh, she's pretty straightforward.

793
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,941
On the bed versus on a desk.
Do you do it differently?

794
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,194
(laughs awkwardly)

795
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:38,282
Well, I just have this incredible urge
to fix you up with my friend.

796
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,535
So when was your last relationship?

797
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,080
Do I have to answer that?

798
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,039
Are you a good kisser?

799
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,753
I can tell you're a very good kisser
by looking at your lips.

800
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:51,963
(laughs awkwardly)

801
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:54,757
I learned to read faces.

802
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,217
So I can just tell.

803
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,302
What does my face tell you?

804
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,808
Well... First, you're a workaholic.

805
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,810
You stress out your subordinates
a little bit, no.

806
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,020
You're a perfectionist
who gives them a tough time.

807
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:10,690
And the tips of your eyebrows tell me

808
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,568
that you're very direct
and don't mince words.

809
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,904
Gosh, your subordinates
must get hurt a lot.

810
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,158
They must have a lot to say.

811
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:24,036
-Be careful walking around at night.
-Gosh, honey. Why do you keep saying that?

812
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,415
Wait, your cousin who works at ZEU AD...

813
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,500
Are you Ms. Hong Yesool's cousin?

814
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,794
Ms. Hong Yesool is your cousin?

815
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,589
Ah, no. No.

816
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,133
Who's that? Who could it be?

817
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,010
(laughs awkwardly)

818
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,054
Oh, my goodness. Your glass is empty.

819
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,557
Let me pour you a drink.

820
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,312
Well, you know, what I'm saying
is that you have a very nice face.

821
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,355
That's what I'm saying.

822
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,150
-(laughs awkwardly)
-Did I tell you my name?

823
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,320
-Huh?
-Did I say your name?

824
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:58,738
Did I?

825
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,656
I think you told me his name.

826
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,867
-Oh, did I tell you?
-That's right.

827
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,202
(laughs)
Oh, I did.

828
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:06,162
-Yeah, you did, babe.
-Yeah, I did. That's right.

829
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,247
(both laugh)

830
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,582
-I must've told you. Did I?
-(Howoo laughs)

831
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,541
You did.

832
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,168
(woman gasps)
My goodness.

833
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,503
-WOMAN 2: They stole everything.
-WOMAN 3: Goodness, what in the world!

834
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,047
-WOMAN 1: What happened?
-WOMAN 3: My goodness.

835
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,507
WOMAN 1: Everything? Oh, my goodness.

836
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:19,967
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

837
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,803
-What happened?
-Goodness. You didn't know?

838
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,556
The houses in this neighborhood
keep getting burglarized.

839
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,643
You know, they take off
with anything worth any money.

840
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,438
-Dear, make sure you lock up your place.
-Okay.

841
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,066
How could they rob three houses in a day?

842
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:39,070
And they robbed only
a couple of days ago. You watch out too.

843
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,280
Gosh. Okay, okay. Be careful going home.

844
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:42,949
Since two pretty ladies
live in your house,

845
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:44,158
you should be extra careful.

846
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,410
-WOMAN 1: Did they steal a lot of stuff?
-WOMAN 2: Yeah.

847
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,204
-Gosh, I'm so nervous.
-They took everything.

848
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,622
Shouldn't we move?

849
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,124
What do I do?

850
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,126
Did he catch on?

851
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,837
Yesool will chew me out
if she finds out about this.

852
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,548
(sighs)

853
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,676
She said he's psychic. She was right.

854
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,262
(sighs)

855
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,558
What's going on?

856
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:13,562
Why are you sulky?
You haven't said anything since earlier.

857
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:18,776
You.

858
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,320
Did you ever ask me?

859
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,240
-Huh?
-You know, my friend.

860
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,118
You asked so many questions
to a guy you just met.

861
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,246
I counted. You asked 32 questions.
Out of those. Whoa.

862
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,082
Did you ever ask one of them to me?

863
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,793
(sighs)
What's the use of asking those things?

864
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,378
What?

865
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,965
How could you? Whoa! Jeez!

866
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,135
Aren't you curious about me at all?

867
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,678
(sighs)

868
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,221
I am.

869
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,140
Seungtaek.

870
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,100
By chance, do you like me a lot?

871
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,019
No.

872
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,520
Did you like me?

873
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,315
I do. I like you. I still like you.

874
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,442
I like you a lot.

875
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,612
I liked you a lot too, Seungtaek.

876
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,118
Give me your cellphone.

877
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,786
My phone? Why?

878
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,043
DELETE CONTACT

879
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,214
I deleted my number.

880
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,091
Let's break up.

881
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,553
What?

882
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,514
Take care.

883
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:32,767
Make sure you don't skip meals.

884
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,270
I noticed that you eat too much protein,
thinking back to all our date spots.

885
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,772
I know you like those foodie places,

886
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,399
but there are many vegan places too
these days.

887
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,443
Try those places
with your next girlfriend.

888
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,737
You enjoyed them too,
and you're not even vegan.

889
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,366
(stuttering)
Wait, what in the world are you saying?

890
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:51,285
(sighs)
It's been exactly a week.

891
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,704
It's been fun.

892
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,374
Goodbye.

893
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:01,128
(dramatic music)

894
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,383
(exhales deeply)

895
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,679
(sighs)

896
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,104
(Minhee yawns)

897
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:20,940
(Sanggoo moans with fatigue)

898
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,738
I guess I've been working here
for too long.

899
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,740
I never thought I'd see Hong Yesool
take a day off.

900
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,158
Man.

901
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,660
I know.

902
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,246
(gasps)
Is she sick or something?

903
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,415
(gasps)
Maybe she's on a date?

904
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,042
Hey, stop talking nonsense.
She wouldn't go on a...

905
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,627
-MINHU: Let's meet.
-Yes, sir.

906
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,711
Oh, okay.

907
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,256
(in a teasing voice)
"Stop talking nonsense."

908
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:54,932
(sighs)

909
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,103
(exhales)

910
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,527
I haven't been here in so long, huh?

911
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,614
Nice weather, huh? Perfect for camping.

912
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,159
After we go on three dates--

913
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:16,036
I got it. You do your best too.

914
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,374
If you don't put in your best effort
and just kill time, I'll be really sad.

915
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,213
(snorts)

916
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,718
Oh, boy.

917
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,848
(light music)

918
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,274
PILYO: Okay.

919
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,944
(light music)

920
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,711
It will be perfect here.

921
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,087
The second proposal.

922
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:10,508
We can also highlight the car
in many different ways in this location.

923
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:11,550
(scoffs)

924
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,512
Are you here on a date with me,
or are you here to work?

925
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,556
I'm about to feel a little bit upset.

926
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,099
So eat this before it gets soggy.

927
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,518
Here.

928
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,105
Pop one egg yolk
and keep the other one intact.

929
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,566
One bag of vegetable flakes
and one-and-a-half bags of powder.

930
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,901
Right? Your preference?

931
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,653
Why bother to remember all that?

932
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,656
You know me. I'm smart.
I have an even better memory.

933
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,449
That's right.

934
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,661
You had such a good memory
that you only did whatever I hated.

935
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,037
That's right.

936
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,164
You could've told me right there and then.

937
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:45,501
You just kept it all in and picked a fight
over something else. And we'd fight.

938
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,086
(slurps)

939
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,212
Do you want to fight again?

940
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,592
Well, no, I'm just saying
that's how good my memory is.

941
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,846
(slurps)

942
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,475
So how do you feel?

943
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,727
About what?

944
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,646
How do you feel now that I'm back?

945
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,148
How does it feel for me
to be by your side again?

946
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,694
What do you mean...

947
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,698
You like it? A little nervous excitement?

948
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,825
Are you glad that I'm back?

949
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,786
What's with you? You're being so cheesy.

950
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,831
I'm not being cheesy.
I'm just being honest.

951
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,834
Why? You don't like it?

952
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,588
I've been thinking the whole time.

953
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,798
That when I go back,

954
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,426
when I see you again,

955
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,096
I'll never do anything to regret again.

956
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,891
That I'll say everything
I want to say to you

957
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,519
and hear everything from you.

958
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,104
That's what I thought.

959
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:53,986
So I'm really happy today.
(chuckles)

960
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,030
Oh, right.

961
00:51:56,572 --> 00:52:00,242
Since you picked this place,
let me do something I want to do too.

962
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,787
Go ahead and eat first.

963
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,665
(dramatic music)

964
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,033
(dramatic music continues)

965
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:07,685
(in English)
Thank you.

966
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,606
(in Korean) Is watching your movie
what you wanted to do with me?

967
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,817
I'm sure you haven't seen it yet.

968
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,361
How did you know that?

969
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,154
I know what you're like.

970
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:22,825
Remember?

971
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,703
We shot our senior project
in that location.

972
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:30,040
As if you knew it was going to rain
all of a sudden,

973
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,334
you rearranged our shooting schedule.

974
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,795
Thanks to you,
our equipment didn't get wet,

975
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,255
and we met our deadline too. Right?

976
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,342
Shouldn't you pay me
some of the royalties?

977
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:43,095
I pretty much wrote half of your script.

978
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:46,265
(scoffs)
Sue me. I'd welcome that.

979
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,479
A lawsuit like this usually
lasts three years. You know that, right?

980
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,398
I'd be happy if I got to see you
for three more years.

981
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,315
(snorts)

982
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,442
(scoffs)

983
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,612
But I didn't add that scene.

984
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,327
When we first met.

985
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,588
(light music)

986
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,242
(rain pattering)

987
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,252
(light music continues)

988
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:20,609
I still remember that day so vividly.

989
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:25,822
So I wanted to ask you even more.

990
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,574
Why

991
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,410
did we break up?

992
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,083
YESOOL: How could I have told you?

993
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:38,919
That our future together

994
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,255
would always be miserable.

995
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,468
(light music)

996
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,034
(chuckles)

997
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,748
(soft chuckle)

998
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,889
Why are you doing this?
You have to tell me, so I'd know.

999
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,225
You've been acting weird since that day.

1000
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,060
And what if I tell you?

1001
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,105
If I tell you, what can you do to fix it?

1002
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,732
(sighs deeply)

1003
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,610
You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

1004
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:46,486
Do you think

1005
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,782
we'd be different if I told you?

1006
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,620
Please stop. Please?

1007
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:56,830
Get a hold of yourself!

1008
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:01,627
(exhales deeply)

1009
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,463
(sighs)

1010
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,425
(dramatic music)

1011
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:31,490
(sighs)

1012
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,077
Why are you doing this?

1013
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,496
You know there's nothing going on
between Eunjung and me.

1014
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,914
I just don't like it.

1015
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,415
Just don't see her.

1016
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:43,585
So I'm asking you why you're saying this.
Just tell me!

1017
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,880
YESOOL: Because I saw the future.

1018
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,175
You and her.

1019
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,220
(dramatic music)

1020
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,359
Sure.

1021
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,528
Say "daddy," darling. "Daddy."

1022
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,279
Mommy.
(laughs)

1023
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:13,031
Oh, boy.

1024
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,784
-How adorable.
-Mommy. Daddy.

1025
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,160
(laughs)

1026
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,995
(hums)

1027
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:30,298
YESOOL:
No matter how many times I checked,

1028
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:33,885
I couldn't change the future.

1029
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,600
(dramatic music)

1030
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,533
(fire crackles)

1031
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,636
That scene.

1032
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:21,266
I shot that after thinking about it a lot
because I didn't understand it.

1033
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:24,394
Why did you...

1034
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,563
kiss me like that?

1035
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:31,234
Every time you wanted
to say something to me,

1036
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,613
you kissed me.

1037
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:37,324
Without any explanation.

1038
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,870
That's all I could think about
after we broke up.

1039
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,708
"Why didn't I ask her that?

1040
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,044
And why...

1041
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,839
didn't she say anything to me?"

1042
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,843
If I got to see you again,

1043
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,014
if I got such an opportunity,

1044
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,644
I wanted to ask you for sure.

1045
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,861
Hong Yesool.

1046
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,116
By any chance...

1047
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:28,667
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

1048
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,718
It's cold.

1049
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,555
How many minutes to go
for the movie to end? I'm kind of cold.

1050
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:43,390
(sighs)

1051
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,809
I feel like I'm coming down
with something.

1052
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,644
Can we go now?

1053
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,898
Sure. We have plenty of time.

1054
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,670
Drop me off over there.

1055
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,506
(sighs)
Um-hm.

1056
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,720
(somber music)

1057
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,568
Be careful on your way home.

1058
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:39,529
I'll email you the pictures
of the location I took today.

1059
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,407
(scoffs)
Talking about work all the way to the end?

1060
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,785
Please don't worry, Ms. Hong Yesool.

1061
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:47,329
Bye.

1062
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:52,083
(somber music)

1063
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,486
I SHED TEARS EVERY TIME I KISS YOU

1064
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,103
(suspenseful music)

1065
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,152
What happened?

1066
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,826
(door creaks open)

1067
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:20,255
(breathes nervously)

1068
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,427
What is all this?

1069
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,097
What's going on?

1070
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,391
(breathes nervously)

1071
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,893
(gasps)

1072
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:35,228
How...

1073
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,313
(gasps)

1074
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:38,982
Oh, no. What is this?

1075
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,074
Who...

1076
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,326
(stuttering)
Who's there?

1077
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,413
(ominous music)

1078
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,754
(breathes nervously)

1079
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,018
(Yesool breathes nervously)

1080
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:21,941
(Yesool screams)

1081
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:22,984
(moans fearfully)

1082
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:24,319
MINHU: Hong Yesool!

1083
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,780
Shit.

1084
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,244
Yesool.

1085
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,954
Are you okay?

1086
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:37,040
(Minhu pants)

1087
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,333
YESOOL: Mr. Cha.

1088
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,379
(closing theme music)
