1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,713
(breathes deeply)

2
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:10,928
(dramatic music builds)

3
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,305
YESOOL: Just once.

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,849
I just want to check one more time.

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,935
(dramatic music)

6
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,423
(theme music)

7
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,425
BIRTH OF ZELUS

8
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,226
What are you doing?

9
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,146
(smooching)

10
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,566
EPISODE 3

11
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,402
What are you trying to do to me right now?

12
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,119
Oh, you were drenched

13
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,332
and looked pale,
so I was trying to see if you were okay.

14
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,542
In any case, I brought you some water.

15
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,253
I think you should eat porridge
or something before you take medicine.

16
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,589
Should I get you some food?

17
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,176
I guess that'd make you feel
more uncomfortable.

18
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,179
I'm sure you would prefer me
to leave, right?

19
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,765
(inhales)
Anyway, thank you so much for today.

20
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,975
I'll get going then.

21
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,061
(upbeat music)

22
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,069
My purse.

23
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,912
(upbeat music continues)

24
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,218
Cha Minhu and me?

25
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,304
So that's how it's going to be, huh?

26
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,476
SEUNGTAEK (on phone):
Why did you even bother?

27
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,644
What?

28
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,105
Jeez, you're pissing me off again.

29
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,691
Hey, you were woozy

30
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,734
and I was working
so I couldn't take you home.

31
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,946
You hate being hospitalized.
What could I do? What? What could I do?

32
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,030
(sighs)

33
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,198
SEUNGTAEK: Hey.

34
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,367
Wasn't Yesool appalled
when she saw your place?

35
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,994
Man, I'm shocked every time I go there.

36
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,122
SEUNGTAEK (on phone): You know?
(chuckles)

37
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,625
I just asked her to give you the medicine.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,252
Did something happen?

39
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,461
-Huh?
-I'm hanging up.

40
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,644
(sighs deeply)

41
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,480
Oh, my god. This is totally unexpected.

42
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,275
HOWOO: I can't believe I was totally off.

43
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,111
-Cha Minhu and you?
-I know.

44
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,781
How do I get myself to go that far
with Cha Minhu?

45
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,159
Why? When? How?

46
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,202
What leads up to that?
What makes us do it?

47
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,289
(groans in frustration)
Why did I do that?

48
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,541
What? What? What is it this time?

49
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,044
I mean, I was horrified by the thought
of sleeping with Cha Minhu.

50
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,088
So I tried to foresee again

51
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,632
-but he opened his eyes.
-(gasps)

52
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,884
Damn it.

53
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,969
What if he thinks I'm interested in him?

54
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,512
-(bottle clanks)
-Yesool.

55
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,848
-Just sleep with him.
-What?

56
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,391
Just do it. Okay?

57
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,018
What you foresaw always came to pass.

58
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,479
You said you saw his scar
and where you'll sleep with him too.

59
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,063
(sighs)

60
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,649
Don't you remember that time?

61
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,110
You just wanted to see the future
one more time,

62
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,196
and you ended up
becoming an emotional mess!

63
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,655
Why are you bringing that up again?

64
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,491
(Haejin tuts)

65
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,452
-Well...
-When you two get together,

66
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,705
all you ever talk about is Cha Minhu.

67
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,415
So, you're dating Cha Minhu?

68
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,167
-(clears throat)
-No, I'm not.

69
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,669
Jeez, you were talking crap
about him every time you were here.

70
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,756
I knew this would happen.
Hatred stems out of affection.

71
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,383
So when will you go out with him?

72
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,887
(sighs)
Haejin! Didn't I tell you?

73
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,515
I messed up my own life
and how it turned out.

74
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,892
-Are you talking about Lee Pilyo?
-No!

75
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,645
-Well, that's...
-(sighs softly)

76
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,104
I mean...

77
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,650
What? Did you tell him
all about Pilyo too?

78
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,612
Whoa, Yesool, don't drink
with just anybody.

79
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,739
You tell everyone everything. Jeez.

80
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,160
(hair dryer buzzing)

81
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,543
(sighs)

82
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,173
(clicks)

83
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,426
Just sleep with him once and end it.

84
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,512
It's not like you'll be in a relationship
for sleeping with him.

85
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,013
Right?

86
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,100
Like kissing once doesn't always lead
to a relationship.

87
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,685
Exactly.

88
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:56,189
You can't do anything about the future
and Cha Minhu could care less.

89
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,025
Will you be the only one
stressing out over it?

90
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,779
(hair dryer buzzing)

91
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,121
(cars honking)

92
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,338
(beeps)

93
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,216
-(beeps)
-(whirs)

94
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,636
Oh! Hold it!

95
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,975
(quirky music)

96
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,686
AUTOMATIC OPERATION

97
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,812
(Minhu sighs)

98
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,482
YESOOL: Damn it.

99
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,902
Why did I have to run into him?

100
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,155
What should I say?

101
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,575
Are you feeling better?

102
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:53,496
It was so crazy yesterday,
so I didn't get to thank you.

103
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,499
Thank you so much

104
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,754
-for saving me at the pop-up store...
-What are the KPIs you expect?

105
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,839
And what about ROAS?

106
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,343
Based on the sales after the release
of the commercial

107
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,053
and the pop-up store event,

108
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,891
the KPIs are expected to increase
by 140 percent compared to last month.

109
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,394
We expect the ROAS
to increase accordingly...

110
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,604
How about ROI?

111
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,983
Labor and materials costs
for the pop-up store were high

112
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,486
so we'll have to see the sales data,

113
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,613
but it should be fine
with the sales on the rise.

114
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,117
(sighs)

115
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,663
YESOOL: How come he doesn't ask me
about last night?

116
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,123
MINHU: Hong Yesool.

117
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,583
Yes?

118
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,294
You were amazing.

119
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,590
If you mean about last night...

120
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,633
(door opens)

121
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,135
(quirky music)

122
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,014
Shit, this is driving me crazy.

123
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,977
(Eomji gasps)
Oh, my goodness.

124
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,187
(gasps)

125
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,897
Oh, my goodness.

126
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,942
Yesool, you look so pretty in the picture.

127
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,653
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

128
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,446
EOMJI: Again.

129
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,741
(rapping)
♪ Again, I got all dressed up for once ♪

130
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,702
♪ They never hang a big picture
of me like that ♪

131
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,120
♪ Even if I get dolled up every day ♪

132
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,955
♪ They never hang a big picture
of me like that ♪

133
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,958
♪ Again. How was my rap?
Oh, yeah, my friend ♪

134
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,960
-(in English) Good job.
-Oh, yeah. Thank you.

135
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,128
(sighs)

136
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,587
(indistinct chatter)

137
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,424
Your former subordinates,
Cha Minhu and Hong Yesool.

138
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,134
Why are they all over the place?

139
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,343
(sighs)

140
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,429
SANGGOO: Hey, guys. I'm here too.

141
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,055
I'm on Planning Team 1 too.

142
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,435
Oh, here's our
ultimate optimistic colleague.

143
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,521
Aren't you as insignificant
as dust on Planning Team 1?

144
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,564
(scoffs)

145
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,482
Have some self-respect, you know.

146
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,608
(inhales deeply)

147
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,278
They give me so many bonuses
just for breathing.

148
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,738
Who cares about self-respect?

149
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,322
Oh.

150
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,534
Didn't you see our team receive
a special cash bonus

151
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,161
from our vice-president this morning?

152
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,495
Cash bonus?

153
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,706
Hey, just your team?

154
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,250
Some people might think you deserved it.

155
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,085
I'm part of the team. We're a team.

156
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,212
When my team excels,
it means I'm doing a good job.

157
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,882
-(indistinct chatter in distance)
-It's only a matter of time

158
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,967
before Hong Yesool surpasses you.

159
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,594
Aren't you humiliated?

160
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,137
No, I'm not.

161
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,808
At some point, I told myself
that I'd be a doormat for our company.

162
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,394
Please tread on me and pass right by me.

163
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,897
Hey, figure out if you want
to be trodden or jumped over.

164
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,691
So... are you really starting
the Mopix campaign?

165
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,568
Oh, that?
(flicks tongue)

166
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,527
Which production team are they going with?

167
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,528
That?
(flicks tongue)

168
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,821
-What the hell?
-That stupid tongue.

169
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,448
You know what?
(flicks tongue)

170
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,366
-Jeez.
-I should just pull his tongue out.

171
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,493
-(flicks tongue)
-Hey.

172
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,619
Hey, hey.

173
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,245
-SANGGOO: Oh.
-Oh, there he is.

174
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,581
EOMJI: Wow.

175
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,084
-SANGGOO: Hey, hey. I have to go.
-EOMJI: He's asking for you.

176
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,086
KYUNGSEOK: Hey, which production team...

177
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,421
(sighs)
He's moving up fast.

178
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,673
(sighing)
Look at him chase after him.

179
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,176
Are they Cha Minhu's posse or what? Jeez.

180
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,261
(cheerful music)

181
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,472
The beds for display were all sold out.

182
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,517
The premium product sales went up by 180%.

183
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,436
It's all thanks to you believing in us.

184
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,523
A bed commercial without a bed.

185
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,858
To be honest,
I was a little confused at first.

186
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,985
But look how we’re rewarded for it.

187
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,029
The storefront, the press,
and social media.

188
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,031
They're all going crazy.
But look how we're rewarded for it.

189
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,326
The pop-up store and Oh Jiyoung's
goods event were excellent too.

190
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,830
You're something else, Mr. Cha.

191
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,374
Ms. Hong was the lead on this project

192
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,000
and I only watched from afar.

193
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,544
MANAGER: Really?

194
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,132
I'd better get on your good side
from now on, Ms. Hong.

195
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,134
(chuckles)

196
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,177
And other team members
who trusted Ms. Hong

197
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,304
and followed her lead
took a big part in it as well.

198
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,643
(cheerful music continues)

199
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,522
A bed, a mattress, or a sofa.

200
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,482
Just name it.

201
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,276
We'll send one

202
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,944
to everyone on Planning Team 1.

203
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,070
Yay! Oops.

204
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,656
Bye.

205
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,242
(all cheer)

206
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,077
SANGGOO: I want all three of them.

207
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,495
Me too.
(laughs)

208
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,124
This is Mr. Cha's treat.

209
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,959
For all your hard work.

210
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,086
(cheers)

211
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,504
-EOMJI: Don't clap.
-SANGGOO: Oh, okay.

212
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,423
-EOMJI: Let's eat.
-ROMA: Wow.

213
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,009
I've only seen this place on social media.

214
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,638
I know. You have to make reservations
two months in advance to eat here.

215
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,890
(Minhee exclaims)

216
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,059
SANGGOO:
He must've known it two months ago.

217
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,520
That our PM would pull it off.

218
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,773
Two months.
He must've known it two months ago. Wow.

219
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,027
(laughs)
He's extraordinary. Way above the rest.

220
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,947
(sighs)
I wish I could be on his team forever.

221
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,950
You saw earlier, right?
He gave us all the credit.

222
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,577
He's hardcore when it comes to working,

223
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,913
but he goes all out
rewarding us afterward. Right?

224
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,207
After making us work late
for ten days straight, right?

225
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,375
But he treats you big time like this. Bam.

226
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,085
Yeom Kyungseok, that ass.

227
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,337
You know, tteokbokki?

228
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,088
-That's all he orders in for us. Damn it.
-(chuckles)

229
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,798
Can I be honest with you?

230
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,552
I seriously want to join Planning Team 1.
It's a secret.

231
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,638
-I'd say we're part of Planning Team 1.
-Right?

232
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,972
(laughs)

233
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,605
Ms. Hong. Why are you so quiet today?

234
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,773
Oh.

235
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,900
EOMJI: I know.

236
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,320
Hong Yesool is not chiming in on Mr. Cha.

237
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,907
-(chuckles awkwardly)
-SANGGOO: Ms. Hong.

238
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,243
What happened yesterday?

239
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:27,121
Did you take Mr. Cha home
from the hospital?

240
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,999
Oh, yes. I drove him home.

241
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,918
-I see.
-(laughs softly)

242
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,086
MINHEE: How is it?

243
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,005
Such a mysterious place. I'm so curious.

244
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,008
-(Eomji crunching)
-Well, it wasn't...

245
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,219
all that ordinary, but...

246
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,346
How does it look?

247
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,473
It's all the same, you know.
(inhales)

248
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,268
I was so out of it
since I just put him to bed...

249
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,395
ALL: Put him to bed?

250
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,604
MINHEE (whispers): What?

251
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,023
Well...

252
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,567
-He was out, so what else would I do?
-(both gasps)

253
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,236
ALL: He was out?

254
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,279
(Eomji blows raspberry)

255
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,739
And? What happened next? Huh?

256
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,867
I can't listen to this with a clear head.
Let's drink first.

257
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,953
Okay, go on.

258
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,250
Mm. Oh.
(munching)

259
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,585
Are you feeling better, Mr. Cha?

260
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,629
I heard there was an accident
at the pop-up store.

261
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,298
(chuckles)
I'm fine.

262
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,842
(inhales deeply)
Billy was an amazing success.

263
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,552
Mr. Cha, you never disappoint.

264
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,722
The PM of that project
was Ms. Hong Yesool, not me.

265
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,141
VICE PRESIDENT: Hmm. Ms. Hong Yesool?

266
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,478
Hmm. Then are you working with her
on the Mopix project as well?

267
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,896
(Sunhee chuckles)

268
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,733
For Ms. Hong's first project as a PM,

269
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,445
everyone knows
how much Mr. Cha helped out.

270
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,404
-(Sunhee laughs softly)
-(clears throat)

271
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,699
You know, Mr. Cha pretty much carries
Planning Team 1 himself.

272
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,160
-(both laugh)
-KYUNGSEOK: That's right.

273
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,663
So why aren't other chiefs
pulling their weight in their teams?

274
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,206
(both coughs in bewilderment)

275
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,628
Ms. Jo Sunhee, didn't Mr. Cha
work under you before?

276
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:58,963
(laughs awkwardly)
Yes.

277
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,174
(clears throat)
I was his mentor.

278
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,885
Mm. At this rate, I think

279
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:08,014
he's going to be
the youngest executive director.

280
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,850
-Then what happens to the hierarchy?
-(manager chuckles awkwardly)

281
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,478
His seniors are all still ahead of him.
That's too...

282
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,730
-(chuckles awkwardly)
-What does it matter?

283
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,692
Zeu Ad is financially sound,
thanks to Planning Team 1.

284
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,403
(inhales deeply)

285
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,406
You must pull off another success
for Mopix

286
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,241
and bring up our sales. Okay?

287
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,119
I'll do my best.

288
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,871
(laughs)
Good.

289
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,957
(sighs deeply)
I wish there were

290
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,918
10 Cha Minhus in our agency.

291
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,336
Huh?
(laughs)

292
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,631
-Mm, it's fresh. Try the sashimi.
-Yes, sir.

293
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,592
HOWOO: All right. Here you go.

294
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,806
MAN: It's not easy to catch rock bream.

295
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,600
Did you really catch this in a week?

296
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,895
Even when we go to Gangwon-do
and stay there for a month,

297
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,313
we can barely catch this.

298
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,898
I have many talents.

299
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,234
It must be a piece of cake for you
to catch black porgies

300
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,902
-and red seabream too at this speed.
-Hmm.

301
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,862
MAN: All right. Then...

302
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,031
why don't you join
our One Love Fishing Club?

303
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,993
No. I'll give you everything.

304
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,829
I'll give you all this.

305
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,206
I'm done as of today.

306
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,333
Enjoy.

307
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,752
Huh?

308
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,006
She's cool. Something about her is cool.

309
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,467
MINHU:
At the anniversary party next week,

310
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,428
they'll introduce the Mopix project
that we'll be taking on.

311
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,098
The client won't be providing us
with any OT briefings.

312
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,559
They said they'd fully go
with our proposal.

313
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,437
Oh, then is your proposal all ready?

314
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,439
Are you going to be the PM
on this project again?

315
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,484
No. I'm going to assign
this project to the one

316
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,528
who brings me the best proposal.

317
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,322
Gosh, this is
a large-scale project, though.

318
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,283
You realize that the success
of this project

319
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,993
will lead to bonuses
and promotions, right?

320
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:52,910
Yes.

321
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,954
I'll accept proposals
until the end of next week.

322
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,124
I look forward to end results
that won't disappoint me.

323
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,041
That'll be all.

324
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,293
SANGGOO: Yes, sir.

325
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,214
(Sanggoo grunts)

326
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,967
Yesool!

327
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,887
You joined Zeu Ad
for the Mopix project, right?

328
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,723
-Yeah.
-I hope you land the PM on this again.

329
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,600
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

330
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,727
Ms. Hong.

331
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,812
You don't have
any other plans today, do you?

332
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,648
(stuttering)
Why... why do you ask?

333
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,108
Let's go to the event hall.

334
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,610
Get ready.

335
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,410
(indistinct chatter)

336
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,624
Coming out to help us take things down
on the last day.

337
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,667
You're just like Mr. Cha.

338
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,337
An AE's job isn't to do something
from A to E

339
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,922
but to do everything from A to Z.

340
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,382
That's what Mr. Cha says all the time...

341
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,886
But I guess Mr. Cha must really value you.

342
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,347
He must've been concerned
since it was your PM project.

343
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,057
He came out the day before the shoot

344
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,226
and checked everything,
including the wiring.

345
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,481
(chuckles awkwardly)
I should move this, right?

346
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,942
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Sure.

347
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,277
-Oh, boy.
-(grunts)

348
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,032
(romantic music)

349
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,927
What the hell.

350
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,680
What was that?

351
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,650
(light music)

352
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,162
(sighs)

353
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,832
YESOOL: I'm glad it ended well.

354
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,918
(smacks lips)

355
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,844
(camera shutter clicks)

356
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,764
(gasps)

357
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,686
(Minhu breathes deeply)

358
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,272
(scoffs)

359
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,816
I guess you're satisfied?

360
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,943
Oh.

361
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,195
(sighs)

362
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,407
Taking on PM for the first time
was rough, huh?

363
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,368
YESOOL: What? All of a sudden?

364
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,705
You lost sleep
and had to rely on Red Bomb.

365
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,498
That must've been tough.

366
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,919
(inhales deeply)

367
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,923
YESOOL: What the hell.

368
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,134
What is he trying to say now?

369
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,261
You worked hard.

370
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,680
MINHU: You worked hard
missing the client's needs

371
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,767
and setting the wrong direction
for the project.

372
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,728
Good job failing to manage
the model and staff.

373
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,105
Good job paying 20 million won

374
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,983
for the damage to the bed
and wrecking the budget.

375
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,360
As a consequence, you set the scene

376
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,070
for an unexpected incident
at the pop-up store,

377
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,821
and displayed your capacity as a PM.

378
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,616
You did a terrific job.

379
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,371
Oh.

380
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,247
I apologize.

381
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,584
I told you a hundred times.

382
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,462
A PM should be able
to forecast all possible variables.

383
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,339
(scoffs)
Yet you can't even read the signs.

384
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,258
Could you possibly handle
being the PM for Mopix?

385
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,888
My goodness.

386
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:45,976
Let's go.

387
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,646
Okay.

388
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,609
(sighs)

389
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,284
(Minhu tuts)

390
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,703
(mumbles)

391
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,705
(Minhu sighs)

392
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,999
(Yesool sighs deeply)

393
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,668
YESOOL: I should've known.

394
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,753
There is no way this asshole
would fall for me.

395
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,589
(clicks tongue)

396
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,924
(sighs)

397
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,801
(Minhu clicks tongue)

398
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,010
(sighs)

399
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,220
Hong Yesool.

400
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,888
Yes?

401
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,682
Last night, why did you...

402
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,434
(stuttering)
Last night?

403
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,393
Yeah.

404
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,019
At my place, why...

405
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,316
Oh, I guess you're wondering what happened
at your place last night. It was...

406
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,360
Why did you come to my place last night?

407
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,697
You should've returned
and wrapped up the pop-up event as the PM.

408
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,699
So unnecessary.

409
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,160
Don't do that again.

410
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,829
Oh, okay.

411
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,918
YESOOL: Does he know or not?
This is so uncomfortable.

412
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,170
(sighs)

413
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,677
(sighs)

414
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,226
LEE PILYO IS THE YOUNGEST
ASIAN FILM DIRECTOR...

415
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,645
I'M SO HONORED TO WIN THIS AWARD
AT THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL

416
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,648
(dramatic music)

417
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,087
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

418
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,547
I SHED TEARS EVERY TIME I KISS YOU

419
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,551
HAROO

420
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,307
Don't you know how to shake hands?

421
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,518
Let's cooperate as a director and staff.

422
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,775
(gentle music playing)

423
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,949
(exhales deeply)

424
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,836
(sighs)

425
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,921
(gulps)

426
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,224
(smooches)

427
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,737
You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

428
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:48,284
Do you think
we'd be different if I told you?

429
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,035
What are you talking about, Haroo?

430
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,955
Tell me, so I can understand.

431
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,915
I saw it.

432
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,584
No, I can see it.

433
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,169
(sobbing)
Never mind what I just said.

434
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,132
It's nothing. Forget it.

435
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,680
Let's break up.

436
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,182
(dramatic music playing)

437
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,947
(breathes heavily)

438
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,617
(smooching)

439
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,332
(breathes nervously)

440
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:49,136
(breathes heavily)

441
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,847
(sobbing)

442
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:09,490
HAROO

443
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,661
All right. You just watched
a 120-minute story

444
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,455
about a man's romantic relationship

445
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,333
and breakup with a woman named Haroo.

446
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,127
The world is watching the director.
A genius.

447
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,756
We'll hear from Director Lee Pilyo
about the movie's hidden,

448
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,841
behind-the-scenes stories.

449
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,719
You can ask me anything.
I'll tell you everything as is.

450
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,139
Oh, yes.

451
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,516
(clears throat)

452
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,602
Director Lee, I really enjoyed the movie.

453
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,229
I was very impressed

454
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,816
by the mise-en-scéne
of the locations in your film.

455
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,026
Throughout the movie,

456
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,070
you portrayed metaphors
and symbols beautifully,

457
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,197
from the protagonist's studio apartment

458
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,241
to the snowy, desolate streets of England.

459
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:53,784
Oh, that.
(chuckles)

460
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,538
I was on a tight budget,
so the only places I could film

461
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,832
were a studio apartment
or in desolate streets.

462
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,460
I had no other choice but fortunately,
they came out beautifully.

463
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,046
(laughing)

464
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,214
Oh, I see.
(chuckles awkwardly)

465
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,591
-MAN: The mic, please.
-HOST: Please pass him the mic.

466
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,176
Hi, Director Lee.

467
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,180
Your detailed portrayal
of how suspicion and mistrust could

468
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,142
drive one to the destruction left quite
an impression on me.

469
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,645
Especially, the female lead Haroo's lines
felt very much alive.

470
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,026
Because an actual person said those lines.

471
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,194
(crowd murmuring)

472
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,655
All right. That brings us
to the end of Cine Talk.

473
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,283
Oh, let's hear from the lady back,
raising her hand.

474
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,492
HOST: Oh, okay.

475
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,247
The ending is a dream scene
that gives hints

476
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,542
at the reunion
between Haroo and her lover.

477
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,337
So there are various opinions
on whether they meet again or not.

478
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,549
I'd like to hear
how you interpret the ending scene.

479
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,845
I want to try to find out going forward.

480
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:58,348
The end of a movie
is the beginning of reality.

481
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,143
(inhales deeply)
Since the credits have gone up,

482
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,187
I'm sure a new movie will start playing.

483
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,688
(scoffs)

484
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,274
DIRECTOR: Director Lee.

485
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:11,028
If you keep this up,
I can't schedule interviews anymore.

486
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,947
Whoa, good.
I didn't want to do interviews anyway.

487
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,949
Every time you open your mouth,

488
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,368
do you know how much
the investors start talking?

489
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,745
That I'm good-looking?

490
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,205
Do they want me to be an actor?

491
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,831
(laughs awkwardly)

492
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,249
You're kidding me, right?

493
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,590
Oh, come on.
We're on a tight schedule as is.

494
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,384
(sighs deeply)

495
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:37,971
You're killing me, Director.

496
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,565
(gentle music)

497
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,698
(chuckles)

498
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,369
BIRTH OF ZELUS,
BECAUSE IT'S WHERE YOUR FAMILY IS.

499
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:09,670

(sighs deeply)

503
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,100
EOMJI (on phone): Gosh, scared me.

504
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,435
(scoffs)
Why are you so startled?

505
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,312
Hey. How can I not be?

506
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,397
Huh?

507
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,148
You finished Billy project
barely three hours ago,

508
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,692
yet you're still at work.

509
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,861
(smacking lips)
Whatever.

510
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:37,322
The first-generation Zelus ad.
Do you know its model and location?

511
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,658
I'm older than you are.

512
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,995
(inhales deeply)
But I wasn't even born in 1976.

513
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,830
Check the reference room.

514
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,999
All right.
(sighs)

515
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,542
(phone beeps)

516
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,169
(sighs deeply)

517
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,563
(inhales deeply)

518
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,860

(power off)

522
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,328
YESOOL: Huh?

523
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,830
What's going on?

524
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,584
Oh, no. I didn't even bring my cellphone.

525
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,629
(suspenseful music)

526
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,568
-(thuds)
-(gasps)

527
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,864
YESOOL (murmus): Shoot.

528
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,126
-(Yesool screams)
-Hong Yesool. It's me.

529
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:17,923
PEOPLE WHO WRITE A NEW HISTORY

(dramatic music)

531
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,983
MINHU: Are you okay?

532
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,902
Oh, yes.

533
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,445
Can you walk?

534
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,531
(breathes deeply)

535
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,701
(breathes deeply)
Follow me.

536
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,253
YESOOL: Oh, so this is how it goes, huh?

537
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,214
He's going to tell me
how he feels about me?

538
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,384
But just like that? Out of the blue?
Cha Minhu?

539
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,635
To me?

540
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,137
MINHU: Watch your steps.

541
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,223
-MINHU: Hong Yesool.
-YESOOL: Yes?

542
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,268
What are you thinking
about that you can't hear me?

543
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,437
I said, watch your steps.

544
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,356
Oh, okay.

545
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,862
You can't fall on your face again.

546
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,115
The stairs.

547
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:28,869
YESOOL: Mr. Cha.

548
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,622
It's pitch-dark. Can you see anything?

549
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:33,957
You're not hesitant at all.

550
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,835
I've walked this way hundreds of times.
How can I not know?

551
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,006
(mumbles)

552
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,511
(electricity hums)

553
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,182
(sighs)

554
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,063
(gasps)

555
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,984
You're working on the proposal, right?

556
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,528
Oh. Yes.

557
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,293
(snorts)

558
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,754
YESOOL: So, since when did he
start liking me?

559
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,299
(gasps)
Is he a pervert who feels ecstatic

560
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,842
when harassing someone?

561
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,552
Number one in consumer satisfaction
and quality survey.

562
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,304
Generation MZ's favorite brand.

563
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,099
These are brand evaluation results
that came out

564
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,184
before we took on this project.

565
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,354
Why did they bother putting together
something you can easily Google?

566
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,147
The Mopix campaign is your dream project.

567
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,274
Didn't you write in your resume

568
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,568
that you joined this agency to work
on Mopix ultimately?

569
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,614
You think you can just go through sites
and embellish it with words?

570
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,991
If you're going to do it, do it right.

571
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,285
(sighs)

572
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,830
Are you not feeling well?

573
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,625
It's nothing.

574
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,377
MINHU: Fix it and bring it back.

575
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,003
(grunts)

576
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:10,512
BRAND EVALUATION NUMBER 1 MOPIX...

577
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,764
(sighs)

578
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,934
(rain pattering)

579
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,662
(exhales)
You said so.

580
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,081
Pardon?

581
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,708
TWO YEARS AGO

582
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,752
The lobby on a rainy day. Isn't it nice?

583
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,424
So why is the summer rain always so loud?

584
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,594
I feel like the sound of rain
will suck me in.

585
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,265
(sighs)
Maybe it's because I worked all night.

586
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,685
I want to put a bed here and sleep on it,

587
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,855
with the sound of the rain
in the background.

588
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,359
You still remember that?

589
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,070
Did it ever occur to you
that you're the one

590
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,114
who can't seem to remember
pretty much everything?

591
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,035
Bye.

592
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,207
(gentle music)

593
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,967
YESOOL: What the heck.

594
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,262
EOMJI: We have to go for it
at the anniversary party.

595
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,180
-(laughs)
-(tuts)

596
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,849
So, many people get together there?

597
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,726
(Eomji whispering)
Don't you know?

598
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,063
Ms. Lee from Production Team 2,
Ms. Park from Planning Team 3.

599
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,898
Even a college student working

600
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,525
-as a server picked up someone there.
-Goodness.

601
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,444
So you're going to see your
new boyfriend there. All right?

602
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,904
Just count on me. Okay?

603
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,907
Wait... Isn't that Mr. Cha?

604
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,908
EOMJI: Huh?

605
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,743
MINHEE: Over there! Over there!

606
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,119
Right? Right?

607
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,956
My, was he seeing someone?

608
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,083
You knew, huh?

609
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,964
EOMJI: Hey, why are you so shocked?
What's so shocking about it?

610
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,048
MINHEE: It's just so fascinating.

611
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,175
-EOMJI: Oh, come on.
-MINHEE: That necklace!

612
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,260
EOMJI: You're being weird.

613
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,305
-(Eomji exclaims)
-MINHEE: But what do you think...

614
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,141
Mr. Cha was buying over there?

615
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,477
Who knows.

616
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,814
There's something
you don't know about him?

617
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:29,150
Gosh, how could I know everything
about him?

618
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,321
That's strange.

619
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,909
Yesool, you used to be firm and clear
in your responses to everything,

620
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,662
but you seem off these days.

621
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,124
You often space out,
and your mind is elsewhere.

622
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,379
Is something the matter these days?

623
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,966
(chuckles awkwardly)
No, nothing like that.

624
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,218
-Guys, can you take a look at me?
-(Minhee gasps)

625
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,970
(squealing)
So cute! Cute!

626
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,264
So cute. Stop it.

627
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:03,101
Enough. I do tend to be busty...

628
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,395
-I'll pay in full.
-(both laugh)

629
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,689
Ms. Hong, you really
aren't buying anything?

630
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,983
No. I'm fine.

631
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,193
-You'll regret it. Jeez.
-(moans in disappointment)

632
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,739
Did I sign it? Oh, you're so kind.
Thank you.

633
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,537
(light music)

634
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,473
YESOOL: I put myself in that situation.

635
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,683
-Why isn't it there?
-Hey.

636
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,146
-What are you doing right now?
-Well, hold on.

637
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,940
-I clearly saw it earlier.
-Get out!

638
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,360
YESOOL: And I caused a misunderstanding.

639
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,279
Why do you keep staring
at my back since that day?

640
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,032
Well, no, no. It's nothing.

641
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,242
What are you trying to do to me right now?

642
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,788
Oh, you were drenched

643
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,917
and looked pale,
so I was trying to see if you were okay.

644
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,797
YESOOL: I came across as ridiculous
having to come up with a lame excuse.

645
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,298
MOUNT CHEONGGYE STATION

646
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,469
The future I saw always turned out badly.

647
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:26,059
All I remember is struggling
while living in the present.

648
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,402
(light music)

649
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,084
(door opens)

650
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,172
Ta-da.

651
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,007
Yesool, how do I look?

652
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,593
What is it this time?

653
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,429
I'll tour all the hot clubs in Seoul.

654
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,557
And what comes after is a secret.

655
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,977
Bye!

656
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,104
Oh, Yesool.

657
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,605
Go to bed first.

658
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,984
Oh, dear.
(scoffs)

659
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,029
(exhales)

660
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,247
(suspenseful music)

661
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,626
PEOPLE WHO WRITE A NEW HISTORY

662
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,503
OF ADVERTISEMENT ZEU AD
30TH ANNIVERSARY PARTY

663
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,672
(indistinct chatter)

664
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,302
ALL: Cheers.

665
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,100
(indistinct chatter)

666
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,275
SANGGOO: You all got dressed up.
(laughs)

667
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,611
-Hi.
-Oh, she's dressed up like a grown-up.

668
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,987
-(Sanggoo exclaims)
-(Minhee shouts)

669
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,405
-You have a pimple on your back.
-(exclaims)

670
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,200
Squeeze it for me.

671
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,576
-Just kidding.
-ROMA: He's kidding.

672
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,287
ALL: Cheers!

673
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,664
-EOMJI: Where's Yesoo? Didn't she come?
-SANGGOO: I haven't seen her, either.

674
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,958
-MINHEE: Maybe she's not here yet.
-EOMJI: Mm.

675
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,294
(classical music playing)

676
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,964
(Eomji laughs)

677
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,175
(gasps)
Goodness.

678
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,845
Lady, you're all dressed up tonight.

679
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,055
(laughs)

680
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,098
Well, it's an important night.

681
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:33,603
Oh, it is? Who is it? Who did you pick?

682
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,856
Gosh, pick whom? Who did you pick, Eomji?

683
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,276
(whispering)
The guy I picked is... Keep it a secret.

684
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:47,283
♪ I get on the floor ♪

685
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,038
♪ You're the only one for me ♪

686
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:55,583
(music fades)

687
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,544
-Really?
-No, no.

688
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,129
-Damn it. It's not...
-What? You talked trash about me, huh?

689
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,923
-Yes. I mean, no.
-Yes? Did you say "yes"?

690
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,466
-Damn it. It's not that.
-"Damn it?"

691
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,426
Get over here. Come here.

692
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,762
No, that's not what I meant.

693
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,099
SANGGOO: Ms. Hong.

694
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,976
(Kyungseok chuckling)
Oh, just a second.

695
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,106
(classical music playing)

696
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,489
(dramatic music)

697
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,929
(dramatic music continues)

698
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,777
What? Do you have something to say?

699
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:06,821
No.

700
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,657
Why are you looking at me like that?

701
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:10,950
What do you mean?

702
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,957
YESOOL: What the...

703
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,209
Did he get a haircut

704
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:23,046
while making up his mind
to ask me out tonight, or what?

705
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,053
(cheering)

706
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,597
(dance music playing)

707
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:39,228
(cheers)

708
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,537
(cheers)

709
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,039
(cheers)

710
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:01,751
Oh, you're a good dancer.

711
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,128
Oh, you're a great dancer!

712
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,217
-Are you here by yourself?
-Yes, I am.

713
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,260
(exclaims in surprise)
Me too!

714
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:12,261
(exclaims)

715
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,638
(cheers)

716
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,812
By any chance, are you the type who tends
to get clingy and stuff like that?

717
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,564
No, I have no time to spare as is.
Why would I do that?

718
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,525
Me too.

719
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,444
I don't have much time left, either.

720
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,738
You're totally my type.

721
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,323
Shall we go somewhere else?

722
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,784
(dance music continues playing)

723
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,246
(classical music playing)

724
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,248
YESOOL:
The president of Piaget likes whiskey.

725
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,541
Always prepare one as a gift.

726
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,542
Whiskey.

727
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,421
Over there. Do you see
the man in his 50s with a cobalt-blue tie?

728
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,630
Oh. Yes.

729
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,048
He's the director at Mopix.

730
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,344
He likes getting thoughtful
handwritten letters, so prepare one.

731
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,263
It'll help at our next meeting.

732
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,015
MINHEE: Handwritten letters.

733
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,186
(upbeat romantic music)

734
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,570
(indistinct chatter)

735
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,906
He looks like he's from a different world
when you see him like that.

736
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,868
Oh, I wonder why he got a haircut.

737
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,454
He looks totally different.
(giggles)

738
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,545
GUARD: Please wait.

739
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,672
Excuse me.

740
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,383
Do you guys all have IDs on you?

741
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,761
-I'm a police officer.
-Oh, okay.

742
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:37,221
-Have you ever seen this man?
-No, I haven't.

743
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,974
Since you haven't,
let me go in and look for him.

744
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,436
-Oh, sure. Go ahead. You can go this way.
-Thanks. Okay.

745
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,356
-HOWOO: Cheers.
-Cheers.

746
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,567
(dance music playing)

747
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:51,944
(exclaims)

748
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,032
Neither of us has a lot of time.
We're in sync!

749
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:59,452
There are so many things
to do in life, you know.

750
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,162
I don't want my life
to end like this either,

751
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,247
so I try to experience
and learn whatever I can.

752
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:07,752
Fortunately, I'm super smart,
so I master things in a week.

753
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,046
People used to call me a genius
ever since I was little.

754
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,215
I got complimented on whatever I did.

755
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,883
But "you suck" or "get lost."

756
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,385
They're always
making personal attacks at work,

757
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,763
so I just want to hide somewhere.

758
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,808
(crowd cheers)

759
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,607
-I'm sorry. Just a second.
-Sorry? Oh, my. Wait. Hey! Hey!

760
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,900
Hey!

761
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,445
What's with that moron?

762
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,489
Oh.

763
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,991
(crowd cheers)

764
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,535
(upbeat music playing)

765
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,121
Where did that punk go?
Did he take off already?

766
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,789
(groans in frustration)

767
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,790
Oh!

768
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,333
I've seen this man.

769
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,962
I know him.

770
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:52,880
What's going on?

771
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,216
(gasps)
Does he owe you money?

772
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,220
You're a creditor, aren't you?
No wonder he was acting weird.

773
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,599
-Do you want me to help you find him?
-What?

774
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,649
Over there. That man! Isn't that him?

775
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,360
Right? Go. Let's go. That's him, right?

776
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,445
-Hey, Kim Joonho!
-Get him! Get him!

777
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,240
(upbeat music playing)

778
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,955
Kim Joonho! That punk! That asshole!

779
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,048
(screams)
Go get him! Go, go! Get him!

780
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,967
-Where did he go?
-Well... To the right? Right or left?

781
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,844
Jeez, I don't know. Just go.

782
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:44,390
-SEUNGTAEK: Man, where did this punk go?
-Huh? Didn't he run this way? Maybe not.

783
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,892
-Oh, here.
-There's another club here.

784
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,185
-This one. Let's check this one out.
-Okay.

785
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,352
Don't you think he might be in here?

786
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,063
Jeez, that jerk...

787
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,232
(dance music playing)

788
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,656
-I don't think he's here.
-Have you seen this man?

789
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,952
Oh! Right there.

790
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,121
There, there. Isn't that him?

791
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,917
Man, that punk.

792
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,922
Hey.
(gasps)

793
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,092
(tuts)

794
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,719
(inhales deeply)

795
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,971
(sighs)
It's all right.

796
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,767
If we can't find him after all this,
I don't think he's in this area.

797
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,228
Well... Let's quit here.

798
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,147
Anyway, it was fun.

799
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,649
Well, thanks.

800
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,026
Wait. Wait a minute.

801
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,987
Come on. Are you kidding me?

802
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,531
I spent so much of my time
trying to help you out

803
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:43,866
and you want to quit like this?

804
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,286
(scoffing)
Well, I appreciate your help.

805
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,913
But it's not like...
(scoffs)

806
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,291
I asked for your help. Right?

807
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,755
By the way, you were coughing
earlier over there.

808
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,175
I take this from time to time. Take it.

809
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:02,760
(Seungtaek clears throat)

810
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,388
(scoffs)

811
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,766
Then why didn't you say no
when I offered to help earlier?

812
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,685
I gave up my precious time to help you.

813
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,480
Wait, I thought you were doing that
out of the goodness of your heart.

814
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,107
(scoffing)
Jeez.

815
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,902
Check out three to four places
out of the goodness of my heart?

816
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,696
-(Seungtaek shouts)
-(Howoo screams)

817
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,739
(light music)

818
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,136
-(moans in bewilderment)
-(Howoo clears throat)

819
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,804
(chuckles awkwardly)

820
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:49,974
-(clears throat)
-Well, why don't you

821
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,976
buy me a drink
out of the goodness of your heart?

822
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,561
Follow me.

823
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,438
What?

824
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,773
(cheeky music)

825
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,068
Come.

826
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,363
(Seungtaek snorts)

827
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,074
(classical music playing)

828
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,038
(phone buzzing)

829
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,211
HOWOO
HOW IS IT GOING? DID HE ASK YOU OUT?

830
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,470
GOOD LUCK
I'M NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT. BYE

831
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,015
(tongue clicks)

832
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,433
(sighs)

833
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,314
(lipstick cap closes)

834
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,774
(purse clattering)

835
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,654
(classical music playing)

836
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,748
PILYO: Hong Yesool.

837
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,167
(romantic music)

838
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,133
YESOOL: Is it time?

839
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,559
He's finally going to ask me out?

840
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,730
Well, should I see how he does it?

841
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,073
(romantic music fades)

842
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,660
PILYO: I'm back.

843
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,373
(sighing)
I'm back.

844
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,291
No.

845
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,255
I missed you.

846
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,800
(sighing)
Man.

847
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,594
I practiced over a hundred times.

848
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,722
(sighing)
I suck.

849
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,767
It took me three years to give you

850
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:00,938
what you wanted so badly.

851
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,485
(scoffs)

852
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,529
(light music)

853
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,213
(dramatic music)

854
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:37,975
(sighing deeply)

855
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:44,857
Mopix has led the Korean
automobile industry for half a century,

856
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:49,987
and Planning Team 1 of Zeu Ad
will take on the advertising campaign

857
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,490
for the new model V9,
which is about to launch.

858
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,659
Oh, and the commercial will be directed

859
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,953
by Director Lee Pilyo,

860
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,499
a world-renowned director.

861
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,043
(applause)

862
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:09,673
Hello.

863
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,593
I'm Lee Pilyo, and I will be directing

864
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:14,845
the Mopix V9 commercial.

865
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:19,225
I'm so honored to take on
the Mopix commercial since

866
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:22,311
-it has a special meaning for me.
-(inhales deeply)

867
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,438
(indistinct chatter)

868
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:26,106
(classical music playing)

869
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,194
Can I ask you something?

870
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,238
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

871
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:35,741
EOMJI: An actor?
Stop talking nonsense. Goodness.

872
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,036
He's handsome enough to star
in his own film.

873
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,872
-He looks so cool.
-Can I talk to you for a...

874
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,374
How do you do.

875
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:49,255
It's not the first time for me, but sure.

876
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:50,756
(indistinct chatter)

877
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,259
I'm Hong Yesool,
an AE for Planning Team 1.

878
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,844
I look forward to working with you,
Director Lee Pilyo.

879
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,764
The same goes for me
as well going forward...

880
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,141
-And can you spare a moment...
-All right then.

881
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,566
(somber music)

882
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:27,668
YESOOL: Yes. It was the same back then.

883
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,884
MY DIRECTOR LEE
CALLING

884
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,304
Thanks for wrapping it up.

885
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,680
-Good work. Good work.
-Good work.

886
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,140
-Director Lee.
-Oh, hey. Excuse me, Assistant Director.

887
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,475
Please check on the conditions before
we shoot this tunnel scene tomorrow.

888
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,393
-Bye now.
-Okay.

889
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,311
-Yes.
-The lighting...

890
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,563
AUTOMATED VOICE: The person you are
trying to reach is not available...

891
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,649
PILYO: Thank you.

892
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,859
ASSISTANT: Bye.

893
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,736
Director Lee, we have to be on the move.

894
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,779
Okay. Go ahead and have dinner first.

895
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,406
-STAFF: Oh, okay.
-PILYO: Yes.

896
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,080
PILYO: What brings you here?

897
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:06,915
Why won't you answer my calls?

898
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,419
I didn't get a call. The phone...

899
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,087
I called you so many times! Give it to me.

900
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,255
No, wait.

901
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,923
-Let me see it!
-Wait!

902
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,385
(sighs)

903
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,512
Hey, I was working!

904
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,765
So you don't answer calls
when you're working?

905
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:23,932
Don't you even eat?

906
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:26,143
Did you come all the way here
to check that?

907
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,061
I did.

908
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,771
-For real?
-That's right!

909
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,357
-Oh, come on!
-What?

910
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,901
YESOOL: I put myself in that situation.

911
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,536
Hong Yesool.

912
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:48,082
Why are you doing this?
You have to tell me, so I'd know.

913
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,542
You've been acting weird since that day.

914
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,505
YESOOL: And I caused a misunderstanding.

915
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,173
And what if I tell you?

916
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,467
If I tell you, what can you do to fix it?

917
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,719
(sighs deeply)

918
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,555
You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

919
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,683
Do you think...

920
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,311
we'd be different if I told you?

921
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:17,361
YESOOL: Making lame excuses
and looking ridiculous.

922
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,157
(Pilyo sighs)

923
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,619
(exhales deeply)

924
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,749
Let's break up.

925
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,424
YESOOL: I ran away as I wanted
to avoid what was to come.

926
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,677
That was me back then.

927
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,225
(somber music continues)

928
00:53:57,276 --> 00:54:00,279
(car horn honking)

929
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,615
(tires screech)

930
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,285
(whooshing)

931
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:10,372
(pants)

932
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,292
Are you crazy? Get a hold of yourself!

933
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,132
Why are you crying?

934
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,427
Why? Why?

935
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,387
(sobbing)
I'm just...

936
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,055
Why are you crying?

937
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,142
Why are you yelling at me?

938
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,518
(whimpers)

939
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,479
I was startled as is.

940
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:36,023
Why are you yelling at me?

941
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,443
(sobbing)

942
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:41,403
Sorry.

943
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,660
(sobbing continues)

944
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,458
What?

945
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,793
(mumbles)

946
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,420
(sobs)

947
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,589
(scoffs)
Are you crazy?

948
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,469
RIB EYE STEAK, PRIME RIBS,
FLAT IRON STEAK, TENDERLOIN

949
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,892
(exhales deeply)
It just melts in my mouth.

950
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:16,188
This is delicious. Why aren't you eating?

951
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,981
You eat.

952
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,651
I didn't know you liked rib eye that much

953
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,653
that you'd cry
in the middle of the street for it.

954
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,238
Boy.

955
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,989
(sobs)

956
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:28,075
I'm hungry.

957
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,494
What?

958
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,704
Rib eye steak.

959
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,581
(sobs)

960
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,291
(scoffs)
Are you crazy?

961
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,252
(chuckles awkwardly)

962
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,421
Gosh, I can't believe
you're buying me rib eye.

963
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:45,259
By the way,
how did you know that I was here?

964
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,390
(clears throat)

965
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,437
I've been craving meat since earlier.

966
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:01,233
But I was in a bind since I left my wallet
and purse at the party.

967
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,568
How come?

968
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,279
Well, I just forgot.

969
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,866
Just like that day.

970
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,831
(clears throat)

971
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,837
(smacks lips)

972
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,047
(exhales)

973
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,091
Mr. Cha.

974
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,720
I have to go somewhere after this.

975
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,140
Can you lend me some money?

976
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:35,809
(scoffs)

977
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,354
(chuckles awkwardly)

978
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,232
-(indistinct chatter)
-(classical music playing)

979
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:47,821
My goodness.

980
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:51,491
Where did she go
leaving her purse and cellphone here?

981
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,161
(clinks)

982
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,167
Do Director Lee Pilyo
and Ms. Hong know each other?

983
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,628
Well? I'm not sure.

984
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:06,089
(breathes deeply)

985
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,383
I noticed earlier when they said hello

986
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:11,345
that it didn't seem
like it was their first time meeting.

987
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,555
(tongue clicks)

988
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,308
Did you sense something slightly odd?

989
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:21,897
Well? I'm not sure about that.

990
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,608
I guess you don't know.

991
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,569
Hey, you're drunk. Let's go.
You're wasted.

992
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,988
-Okay.
-Let go. Let go!

993
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:32,199
No, this is...
No, I was going to take it home.

994
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,451
Let go! Let go of it!

995
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,870
-Shit.
-I was going to take it home.

996
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,456
Gosh, girl. You're killing me.

997
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,087
(sighs)

998
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,215
(gulps)

999
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:51,301
(clicks tongue, exhales deeply)

1000
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,724
But why do you keep following me?

1001
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,601
You don't like places like this.

1002
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:01,853
In case you won't pay me.

1003
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,314
Gosh, I'll pay you back.

1004
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:07,567
You're not even going to drink with me.
So why are you...

1005
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,486
Because you're going to drink a lot.

1006
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,946
Sorry?

1007
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,990
Don't you remember that night?

1008
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,952
(whimpers)
What an asshole.

1009
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:17,869
(sobs)

1010
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:19,663
THREE YEARS AGO

1011
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,628
(sobbing continues)

1012
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,298
What?

1013
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:38,682
(blows)

1014
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,350
(slurps)

1015
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,019
(whimpers)

1016
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:50,068
-It's hot. Oh, it's hot.
-It's hot?

1017
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,154
Hot. Drink water.

1018
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,448
(whimpers)

1019
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,117
(slurps)

1020
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:02,789
(gulps, whimpers continues)

1021
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,803
(sighs)

1022
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,181
Seriously...
(sniffles)

1023
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,850
I'm never going to date again.

1024
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,394
Never in my life.

1025
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,688
There will never be
another romantic relationship.

1026
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,815
But still...

1027
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,277
What do you mean, still?

1028
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:36,948
I'm just going to work

1029
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,992
like crazy from now on.

1030
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:41,787
(sniffles)

1031
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,372
Hey, hey!

1032
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:45,999
-(gulping)
-Hey! Hey!

1033
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,083
(spitting)

1034
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:48,877
Oh.

1035
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,546
Are you really bipolar or what?

1036
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:53,173
What?

1037
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:56,885
It's really tough to figure you out.
That's why.

1038
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:00,180
Did you decide to pick on me
on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays

1039
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,933
and console me
on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays?

1040
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,518
I should know, so I could be prepared.

1041
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,936
Be prepared for what?

1042
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,021
You're confusing me.

1043
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,358
What? How am I confusing you?

1044
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:15,278
Why did you get a haircut?
And why didn't you...

1045
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,616
My hair? What are you talking about?

1046
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,704
(sucks air)
You've been acting like a different person

1047
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:27,332
for the last few weeks compared
to the last five years I've known you.

1048
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,209
What's with you these days?

1049
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:35,090
(sighs)

1050
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,883
YESOOL: I want to tell him everything.

1051
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,350
-YESOOL: One more bottle, please.
-OWNER: Sure.

1052
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,938
YESOOL: One more bottle.

1053
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,565
MINHU: Hong Yesool, that's enough.

1054
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:52,566
Let's go.

1055
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,652
Come on. What's your problem?

1056
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,445
You drank too much.

1057
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,409
(moans)

1058
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,202
(sighs)

1059
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,997
You're acting weird lately.

1060
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,457
-(tongue clicks)
-Are you hiding something from me?

1061
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:13,795
You're much weirder, Mr. Cha.

1062
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:16,882
Saving me at the pop-up store too.

1063
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:19,593
It's also weird that you pop up out
of nowhere at times.

1064
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,595
Like when there was a blackout
and today too.

1065
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:24,055
Oh, and your place.

1066
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,016
What's wrong with your house?

1067
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,227
No TV and no food in the fridge.

1068
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:31,605
Do you even eat?

1069
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:34,608
Oh, right!

1070
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,943
Why do you have so many pill bottles...

1071
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,407
Oh, I'm sorry.

1072
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,410
For what?

1073
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:50,665
You don't like it when I touch you.
You always make a face when I do that.

1074
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:55,337
I'm all right now.

1075
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,089
Now?

1076
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,508
YESOOL: What do you mean by that?

1077
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,053
(quirky music)

1078
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,223
My goodness. See?

1079
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,517
YESOOL: You're so weird.

1080
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:14,731
When you think about it,
you're the weirdest person in the world.

1081
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,234
You're the weird one, not me.

1082
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:22,656
-Ever since that day...
-Oh, that. I had my reasons.

1083
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:26,284
If you heard my reasons,
you'd get me 100 percent.

1084
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:30,872
But then again, you are pretty weird.

1085
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,751
I kind of want to tell you
why I've been weird.

1086
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,045
Is it because I'm drinking?

1087
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,174
But I can't tell you
because it's about you.

1088
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:43,051
It's about me?

1089
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:46,179
Yes. You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

1090
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:48,348
I will.

1091
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:52,102
I'll believe you.

1092
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,731
Well...

1093
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,650
What do you mean you'll believe me?

1094
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,945
-I have to go.
-Hey, be careful.

1095
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,238
-Oh.
-Man.

1096
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,534
-Ma'am, how much is it?
-It's 48,000 won.

1097
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,952
-48,000 won?
-Yes.

1098
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,121
-It's pricy. Here you go.
-The change...

1099
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,622
MINHU: Hey, Hong Yesool!

1100
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,500
-(Yesool shouts)
-MINHU: Hey. Hey!

1101
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,586
Are you crazy? Hey, hey, hey.

1102
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,464
-What's wrong with you?
-(laughs)

1103
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:24,092
-Jeez, shit.
-I feel good!

1104
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:25,719
Get in the car.

1105
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,595
I'll drive you home.

1106
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:28,888
(gasps)

1107
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:32,142
You didn't drink,
so you could drive me home?

1108
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,645
-Oh, my. You're so sweet.
-(scoffs)

1109
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:38,273
How are you going to
face me tomorrow, huh?

1110
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:39,858
What do you mean?

1111
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,193
Why can't I face you?

1112
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:43,987
(gasps)
Why can't I?

1113
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,740
Why not? What does that mean?

1114
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,242
Jeez, hey, hey. Get in. Get in.

1115
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,202
-(moans)
-Watch your head. Hey, hey.

1116
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,163
-(Yesool laughs)
-(Minhu grunts)

1117
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,081
-(laughs)
-Jeez.

1118
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,751
(moans)

1119
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,342
(both sigh)

1120
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:07,635
(exhales deeply)

1121
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,013
But Mr. Cha.

1122
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,517
-Will you really believe me?
-(sighs)

1123
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:19,898
You really, really wouldn't believe me.
I said "really" twice.

1124
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,649
I'll believe you.

1125
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:25,028
You will believe me? No matter what I say?

1126
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,071
Yeah.

1127
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,493
You'll be pretty shocked, though.

1128
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:32,494
(sighs)

1129
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:33,912
You know...

1130
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,373
I see the future when I kiss someone.

1131
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,125
I saw it.

1132
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,837
You and I will be sleeping together
in the future.

1133
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,426
To be honest, I can't believe it, either.

1134
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,719
Think about it.

1135
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:51,721
You and me doing that.

1136
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,475
So I wanted to double-check it.

1137
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,646
-Double-check?
-Yes.

1138
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,190
Can I?

1139
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:07,153
(pensive music)

1140
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,698
(sighs)

1141
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:15,620
You asked for it first, all right?

1142
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,584
(romantic music)

1143
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,065
(romantic music continues)
