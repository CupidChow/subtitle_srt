Ms. Hong.

56
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,855
Boy, that's not right.

57
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,858
I don't think you should go
for that combination today.

58
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,488
YESOOL: No.

59
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,324
It's necessary today.

69
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,404
Have you finally lost your mind
due to lack of sleep?

70
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:43,700
(inhales)
It's sunny. What do you mean, a rainy day?

71

-(Eomji groans)
-It's going to rain.

72
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,079
What?

73
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,082
I saw it. The rain.

74
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,418
For goodness' sake. How silly.

75
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,253

76
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,673

00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,317
What?

84
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,777
How did you know?

85
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,111
My sixth sense.

86
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,238
What?

87
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,450
(screams)

88
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,202
Ms. Yoon!

89
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,121
Oh, my goodness!
You must be so embarrassed.

90
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,290
Get up. Hurry.
What's wrong? Are you embarrassed?

91
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,084
Just get up. Your hair is so messy,
for goodness' sake.

92
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,293
What should I do with you?

93
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,295
Goodness.

94
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,047

97
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,564
Why is the summer rain...

98
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,026
always so loud?

99
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,323

(doorbell dings)

104
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,003
YESOOL: I know.

105
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,671
When this door opens,

106
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,256
we'll make love.

107
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,886
(upbeat music)

108
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,143
I'll open this door, go in,

109
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,605
and kiss him.

110
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,901
And I know that we'll lie down on the bed

111
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,907
and make love.

112
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,493
My sixth sense.

113
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,161
I've foreseen it several times.

114
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,955
That he and I will end up like this.

115
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,834
That I will make love with him after all.

116
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,587
And after that,

117
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,465
I will regret it.

118
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,717
Even though I know it,

119
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,513
I'll end up doing it.

120
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,102
MINHU: You didn't stay up
all night, did you?

121
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,023
You wouldn't say you worked hard on it
or things like that, would you?

122
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,069
If this was the result of hard work,

123
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,363
that would make me angrier

124
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,740
than hearing you say you loafed
the whole time and hurriedly made it

125
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,826
in five minutes this morning.

126
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,121
Do you really want to sleep on that?

127
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,707
Nothing in this satisfies
the client's needs.

128
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,750
All I see is this cheesy copy. Why?

129
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,628
You reinterpreted
the client's needs as you pleased.

130
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,088
It's funny.

131
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,925
(laughs cynically)

132
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,885
(sighs)
And next.

133
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:31,928
TV COMMERCIAL

134
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,596
-Our AD.
-(groans)

135
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,683
You satisfied your selfish needs and greed

136
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,435
by overspending our budget

137
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,103
on this cheap script.

138
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,897
Wow.
(laughs cynically)

139
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,066
It's funny. Right?

140
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,360
-(Minhu laughs cynically)
-(laughs awkwardly)

141
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,320
-(sobs)
-(Minhu sighs deeply)

142
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,323
(sighs deeply)

143
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,244
(gulps)

144
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,246
(sighs)

145
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,414
YESOOL: The next target

146
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,082
is me.

147
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,293
Ms. Hong Yesool.

148
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,421
What's your job title?

149
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,339
It's AE.

150
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,258
What does an AE do?

151
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,595
AE is the leader of an advertising team

152
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,513
that makes commercials
on behalf of advertisers.

153
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,683
They encourage members of the production,
media, and many other teams

154
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,935
to work with limited time and budgets

155
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,812
and plan advertising strategies.

156
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,273
They're coordinators
who help advertising firms meet

157
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,901
-the needs of advertisers...
-MINHU: You don't respect me, do you?

158
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,486
Sorry?

159
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:30,862
You don't.

160
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,824
That's why you did nothing
until it ended up like this

161
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,159
and presented it as an outcome.

162
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,369
Proudly.

163
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,663
Even though you're the person
in charge. Huh?

164
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,666
SANGGOO: Well, but we...

165
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,337
We're encouraging each other
to create something new...

166
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,839
You copied the two sentences
from last season's proposal.

167
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,299
The tone, colors, and font.

168
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,885
You copied page 32 of the reference.

169
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,428
And the background music is similar

170
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,431
to the one in KS Electronics'
recent campaign for about two seconds.

171
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,891
(thuds)

172
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,519
If you're going to work
like some college students,

173
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,897
pay tuition
instead of getting paid every month.

174
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,232
All right?

175
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,110
(Minhu sighs)
Do it again.

176
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,112
I'll give you one more day.

177
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,780
-The end.
-SANGGOO: The end.

178
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,534
(upbeat music)

179
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,874
Ms. Hong Yesool.

180
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,671
Yes, Mr. Cha?

181
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,089
Your sixth sense.

182
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,340
Didn't it tell you?

183
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,302
You're an AE. How did you not know
that it would turn out like this?

184
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,720
(sighs)

185
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,639
If you don't have an eye for it,
just quit.

186
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,599
The deadline is too tight.

187
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,185
And our CD hasn't been feeling well, so...

188
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,145
Ms. AE.

189
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,855
Use your tongue to work.

190
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,439
Not to blame others.

191
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,024
You.

192
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,443
Is it too early to be a PM?

193
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,655
I'm sorry, sir.

194
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,740
I wasn't able to meet your expectations.

195
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,201
I had no expectations of you.
Don't overestimate yourself.

196
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,619
Get out.

197
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,875
(Minhu sighs)

198
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,421
(groans)

199
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,339
(panting)

200
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,676
How did you know Master Cha
would bash the proposal?

201
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,388
I've worked with him for five years.
It's a piece of cake to read his mind.

202
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,514
(gasps)
Yesool.

203
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,349
Is that why you prepared Plan B?

204
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,895
Huh? Did you go to Plan A
even though you knew he'd bash it?

205
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,023
He would've bashed it
no matter what we showed him.

206
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,858
It's better to show him
the worst one first.

207
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,611
Then we'll get scolded less
when we show him a better one next time.

208
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,696
Ah, that was your plan.

209
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,198
(sighs)

210
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,825
Cha, that crazy asshole.

211
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:41,993
(mumbles)

212
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,620
I really want to kill him,

213
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,580
but I'll have mercy on him today.

214
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,123
(inhales deeply)

215
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,416
(sighs deeply)

216
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,047
That's one way to do it.
It's always like this.

217
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,341
I'm short on ideas.

218
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,259
(sighs)
Jeez.

219
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,011
Everyone.

220
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,473
We need to revise the proposal
in 24 hours.

221
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,101
Now click your mouse
on the folder named Billy.

222
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,024
Really Seriously Crazy Last One 18.

223
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,860
The Final Plan A. Next to that.

224
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,279
The file we carefully created.

225
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,324
We Won't End Up Clicking This, Will We?

226
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,243
Nineteen. Plan B.

227
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,410
Open it.

228
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,329
(upbeat music)

229
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:27,830
Click.

230
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:29,874
Click!

231
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,502
Eighteen. The final version.

232
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,045
Brown-eyed Bulbul...

233
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,421
(chuckles)

234
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,049
Really. Seriously. Crazy.

235
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,093
-EMOJI: Gosh, eighteen.
-SANGGOO: Last One Eight...

236
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,720
(panting)
Eighteen. Eighteen. Eighteen. Eighteen.

237
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,180
Oh, gosh!

238
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,556
The Nephew Pad!

239
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,891
Nephew... Nephew Pa...

240
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,479
(both blow air)

241
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,565
CUSTOMERS 2020: 132 2021: 160

242
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,278
(upbeat music)

243
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,495
(music stops)

244
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,372
(traffic noise)

245
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,917
Something soft. That's what this is.

246
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,502
Are you listening to me? Huh?

247
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,212
(indistinct chatter)

248
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,922
(inhales)

249
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,382
(exhales deeply)

250
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,594
Yesool.

251
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,556
I'm doing a vlog about my intern life.

252
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,309
Please tell me the secret to becoming
the youngest PM in this company.

253
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,520
Mr. Intern.
Get an idea of what's going on now.

254
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,896
(on camera)
Forget this vlog

255
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,315
or whatever. Turn off your phone

256
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,859
and at least pretend to search
for references.

257
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,236
Well, to search for references,

258
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,406
I need to know what the role of an AE is
or advertising vocabulary...

259
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,824
What do you not understand?

260
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,785
(clears throat)
What are Deities and what's Master Cha?

261
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,956
We call advertisers "Deities"
because they are deities to us.

262
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,042
And Master Cha
is Mr. Cha Minhu's nickname.

263
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,918
And the role of an AE is...

264
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,047
Oh, I learned that from you earlier.
When you were being scolded by Master Cha.

265
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,174
(giggles)
Thank you.

266
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,385
(sighs)

267
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,220
(clicks tongue)

268
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,727
-EMPLOYEE 1: Hello.
-EMPLOYEE 2: Hello.

269
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,571
(chuckles awkwardly)

270
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,365
I learned about the duties of an AE

271
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,159
mostly from that punk.

272
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,828
The punk who is called Master Cha.

273
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,207
(quirky music)

274
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,918
A life of luxury.
Transforming your dream into reality.

275
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,212
This is the house you want to live in.

276
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,756
We'll pioneer a new genre.

277
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,466
Thank you for your attention.

278
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,843
I'm AD and Assistant Manager
Lee Dahee. Thank you.

279
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:47,970
YESOOL: Actually, he is...

280
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,807
a deity in the advertising industry.

281
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,477
Use your sixth sense.

282
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,145
By the clients' words,
the looks on their faces,

283
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,773
and their tones,
you can tell whether or not

284
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,982
you'll win the contract.

285
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,401
Only those who can do
that survive in this industry.

286
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,322
I DID USE MY SIXTH SENSE
AND READ THE SIGNS

287
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,074
(gulps)

288
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,367
THE NATURAL FOREST COMES INTO YOUR ROOM

289
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,827
YESOOL: I DID USE MY SIXTH SENSE
AND READ THE SIGNS

290
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,703
YESOOL: Cha, that asshole.

291
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,956
If he starts with a smile
when he's obviously pissed off,

292
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,041
that's a sign that our proposal
will be turned down.

293
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,293
If he touches his neck,
that means his next target is me.

294
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,672
Read the signs
and make the impossible possible.

295
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,756
That's the job of an AE.

296
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,841
(sighs)

297
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,553
YESOOL: I did read the signs,
but I guess I'm not experienced enough.

298
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,054
I know what's going to happen,

299
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,222
but I get frustrated
when it actually happens.

300
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,723
YESOOL: CHA, THAT ASSHOLE.

301
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,059
-YESOOL: You know what I mean?
-(soft chuckles)

302
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,936
EOMJI: Hey, I think you're mistaken.

303
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,146
It's not just today
that you were frustrated.

304
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,188
You've been frustrated
for the last five years.

305
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,482
EOMJI:

306
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,942
YESOOL: That's true.

307
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,027
I felt it on the first day.

308
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,404
FIVE YEARS AGO

309
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,697
(Eomji coughs)

310
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,199
(keyboard clacking)

311
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,869
(coughs)

312
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,203
(sniffles)

313
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,748
(keyboard clacking)

314
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,883
I'm your mentor.

315
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,720
Oh.
(breathes deeply)

316
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,642
(sighs)

317
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,729
(sighs)

318
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,692
You can't go anywhere dressed like that.

319
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,611
Sorry?

320
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,696
Change the way you dress.
Your makeup and hairstyle too.

321
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:29,864
The look in your eyes, the way you speak,

322
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,990
and your facial expressions.
Fix all of them.

323
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,533
When we meet our clients
for the first time,

324
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,661
we should be able to show them
our expertise and confidence visually.

325
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,288
You can't wear a suit
that looks too stiff.

326
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,207
Nor something casual
that makes you look less reliable.

327
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,458
Definitely not...

328
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,461
what you're wearing now.

329
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,629
(hiccups)

330
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,797
(quirky music)

331
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,758
(chuckles awkwardly)

332
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,927
Then h-how...

333
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,304
Do I have to spoon-feed you?

334
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,224
Should I start by telling you
what AE stands for?

335
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,393
(sniffles)
AE...

336
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:01,771
Follow me.

337
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,192
-Hurry!
-(chair scrapes)

338
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,069
Okay.

339
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,616
He seems to have a lot of anger.
Be careful.

340
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,243
(hiccups)

341
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,994
(in a quiet voice)
He's so scary.

342
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,287
He's so scary.

343
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,914
(exhales through the nose)
Oh, dear.

344
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,500
(coughs)

345
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,335
Oh, no.

346
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,294
(sniffles)

347
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,380
(quirky music continues)

348
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,049
Go get dressed.

349
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,802
I am dressed.

350
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,220
Get dressed properly.

351
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,805
(indistinct chatter)

352
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,059
SBC
MR. CHA MINHU

353
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,436
Well...

354
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,691
YESOOL: I knew from the get-go

355
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,694
that I should never mess with him.

356
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,530
THREE YEARS AGO

357
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,864
You worked all night on this proposal?

358
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,200
That doesn't mean you can be forgiven
for submitting a piece of shit like this.

359
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,326
-(whimpers)
-(sighs)

360
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,286
(sniffles)

361
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,996
Why are you crying? Are you getting fired?

362
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,415
Did you get dumped by your boyfriend?

363
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,293
Are you so sick
that you can't help crying?

364
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,046
If it's not one of these three cases,
don't cry.

365
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,381
At least not at your workplace.

366
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,717
YESOOL: A jerk who enjoys humiliating me.

367
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,844
A jerk who can't sleep

368
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,554
unless he points out my mistakes.

369
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,680
-Come on.
-(Yesool sniffles)

370
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,724
Are you going to cry every time
you get criticized?

371
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,225
You can't cry for 24 hours.

372
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,518
Learn to fight back tears.

373
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,811
Here.

374
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,937
(inhales)

375
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,942
(inhales)
What's this?

376
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,154
(breathes deeply)

377
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,073
(Minhee whimpering)

378
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,330
(Minhee sobbing)

379
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,171
Open the door.

380
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,299
(whimpers)

381
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,181
Did the production chief go nuts
when you said you'd change the proposal?

382
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,933
(whimpers)

383
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,269
You begged him like crazy and got an okay,

384
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,022
but did the media chief complain
about the schedule?

385
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,565
(sobs) Yesool.

386
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,027
I don't think I can be an AE.

387
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,321
(sobbing)

388
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,531
Come on out.

389
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,744
Why are you crying?

390
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,455
Are you getting fired?
Did you get dumped by your boyfriend?

391
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,707
Are you so sick
that you can't help crying?

392
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,670
If it's not one of these three cases,
don't cry.

393
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,505
At least not at your workplace.

394
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,676
(soft music)

395
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,470
Here. Go to a hair salon
and take a two-hour nap.

396
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,222
Go to a hair salon
and take a two-hour nap.

397
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,556
The way you look now,

398
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,350
you won't be able to convince anyone.

399
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,311
The way you look now,
you won't be able to convince anyone.

400
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,188
Here.

401
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,318
(whimpers)

402
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,073
YESOOL: I learned

403
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,910
all of this damn stuff from my mentor.
(blows air)

404
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,705
I cursed that asshole
when I first heard it.

405
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,041
But now I'm doing
the same thing to my junior.

406
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,711
SANGGOO: It's not true, right? Right?

407
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:12,795
ROMA: Naturally.

408
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,464
-SANGGOO: Ms. Hong. I told him to do this.
-YESOOL: Bye.

409
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,233
I wasn't slacking off. Don't watch me.

410
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,234
Get lost.

411
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,738
You finish three hours earlier
if I stand next to you, Ms. AD.

412
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,239
You're like a ghost.

413
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,657
You psychic bitch.

414
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,744
A bitch who is just like Cha Minhu.

415
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,663
TO MAKE YOUR PRIVATE SPACE SOFT
BILLY, THE SPACE THAT COVERS YOUR SECRETS

416
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,331
Eomji.

417
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,084
Isn't it better
that I come instead of Cha Minhu?

418
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,419
Anyway,

419
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,131
another all-nighter,
and we'll all be free.

420
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,924
Alrighty.

421
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,469
(choking)
For goodness' sake.

422
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,804
(sighing)
Jeez.

423
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,308
By the way, how did you know
that it was going to rain this morning?

424
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,226
-Oh, that?
-Yes.

425
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,021
Well, it's a secret, but I'll tell you.

426
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,898
Baloney. She says everything
she tells me is a secret.

427
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:14,940
I...

428
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,860
can see the future.

429
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,321
(comical music)

430
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:22,990
(sighs)

431
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:28,537
(inhales)
Working all night is really bad for you.

432
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,872
(inhales deeply)

433
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,540
Everyone is going crazy.

434
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,875
(sighs)

435
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,253
(whimsical music)

436
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,472
(panting)
MS. YOON: Just a second!

437
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,557
(whimsical music continues)

438
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,494
AUTOMATIC OPERATION

439
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,550
YESOOL: It's true
that I can see the future.

440
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,719
No one may believe me,

441
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,305
but I have a sixth sense.

442
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,434
When my lips touch someone else's body,

443
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,270
I can see that person's future.

444
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,899
I found out about this ability
22 years ago.

445
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,695
But I have no idea how I got it.

446
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,408
SARA: I'm his guardian. Wait.

447
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,951
Honey.

448
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,121
(Sara sobs)

449
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,790
(tense music)

450
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,922
Kiss me on the cheek.

451
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,843
YESOOL: I don't know when it'll happen.

452
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,511
But one thing for sure is

453
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,555
that the future I see

454
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,224
always happens without fail.

455
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,643
-Ta-da.
-(gasps)

456
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,936
Thank you.

457
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,855
All I want is a kiss on the cheek.

458
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,690
Well...

459
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,904
YESOOL: How unfortunate I am

460
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,073
to be able to see someone else's future.

461
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,159
What a cursed ability.

462
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,368
(laughs)

463
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,745
I'm well aware of that.

464
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,541
Whenever I kissed someone I loved,

465
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,835
I wasn't in their future.

466
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,795
(music stops)

467
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,215
(light music playing)

468
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,676
Well...
(sighs)

469
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,678
I mean...

470
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:51,764
let's...

471
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,433
break up.

472
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,812
Okay. Let's do that.

473
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,065
Good.

474
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,817
I was sick of you anyway.

475
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,403
(light music playing)

476
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,202
(dramatic music)

477
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,501
(music fades)

478
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,174
(scoffs)

479
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,552
What an asshole. I bought that drink.

480
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,137
What a ridiculous jerk.

481
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,224
(slurping)

482
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,392
(cup thuds)

483
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,310
(clicks tongue)
Gosh.

484
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,482
YESOOL: So not using this horrible ability
is my ironclad rule.

485
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,443
(dramatic music)

486
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,030
(exhales)

487
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,578
(music stops)

488
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,458
(coughs)

489
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,086
(quirky music)

490
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,630
Oh, dear.
(coughs)

491
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,883
(coughs)

492
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,761
(sighs deeply)

493
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,596
(both chuckle)

494
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,349
(coughs)

495
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,643
(quirky music continues)

496
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,315
Let's break up.

497
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,109
All right? We're over.

498
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,528
I have no idea what you want.

499
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,612
How can you...

500
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,531
How can you still have a cold?
It's been three months.

501
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,366
I've never seen a girl like you.

502
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,077
This is the right thing to do.
Let's break up.

503
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,752
Kiss! Shit!

504
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,170
(smooches)

505
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,590
(whimsical music)

506
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,342
(tutting)

507
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:59,725
YESOOL: I promised myself that
I'd never kiss someone in my life again.

508
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,602
And I tried.

509
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,606
But no matter how hard I try,
there are times it just happens.

510
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,486
That's beyond my control.

511
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,865
(light music playing)

512
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,331
(light music playing continues)

513
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,834
(clicks tongue)

514
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,296
-(switch clicks)
-(music stops)

515
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,672
Man.

516
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,175
(grunts)

517
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,138
YESOOL: Thank you for your hard work.

518
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,682
I apologize for delaying it by one day.

519
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:41,892
Before you present it to the deity,

520
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,977
you need to get an okay
from Master Cha, don't you?

521
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,396
That's right. If we get an okay from him,

522
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,524
it'll be a piece of cake
to get one from the deity.

523
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,525
(breathes deeply)

524
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,734
(in English)
Okay, okay.

525
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:51,985
(in Korean)
I'll get going.

526
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,030
(groans)

527
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,867
Hi, Mr. Yeom.

528
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,078
Cha Minhu isn't here.

529
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,372
He's not here, right?

530
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,668
I'm a busy person, for God's sake.

531
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:08,919
Hey.

532
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,295
Why isn't he here with you today?

533
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,091
You two are usually joined at the hip.
(giggles)

534
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,385
We've finished checking it.

535
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,679
Please take a final look at it, Mr. Yeom.

536
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,975
(yawning)
I'm sure you did a good job.

537
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,476
(groans with fatigue)

538
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,937
Videos for PPMs are pretty much the same.

539
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:29,898
Mr. Yeom.

540
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:31,984
Can we talk outside for a minute?

541
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,738
-(footsteps receding)
-(door opens)

542
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,532
What did she say?

543
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,992
She wants to talk to you outside.

544
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,995
Jeez. Who does she think she is?
Someone who can order me around?

545
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,329
For God's sake.
(tuts)

546
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,455
(groans)

547
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:47,833
(exhales deeply)

548
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:52,754
Mr. Yeom. We had over
a hundred meetings before the PPM.

549
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,631
Do you know how many of them you attended?

550
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,757
(burps)

551
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,718
(exhales deeply)

552
00:27:58,719 --> 00:27:59,887
Exactly.

553
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,308
Why do you keep holding
such unnecessary meetings?

554
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,809
Planning Team 1.

555
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,395
That's why I hate to work with you guys.

556
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:12,274
Hey. You're worse than Cha Minhu.
You know that?

557
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,358
Jeez.

558
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,486
You need to attend
the final confirmation PT tomorrow.

559
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:17,821
Okay?

560
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,448
Don't you know what I'm like?

561
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,701
I'm going to be thoroughly prepared
to impress our client...

562
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,995
Please make sure to follow
the manual this time.

563
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,040
-You checked what I e-mailed you, right?
-(sniff)

564
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,125
(in English) Oh, shit.
(stomach grumbles)

565
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,920
(stuttering)
Well, okay. All right. Here.

566
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:36,632
(moans in pain)
Wait. Gosh, this is not good.

567
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,593
(in a quiet voice)
That's disgusting, for God's sake.

568
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,677
SOBER UP HANG IN THERE
HANGOVER HELPER HOVENIA DULCIS TEA

569
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,429
(inhales deeply)

570
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,931
(sighs)

571
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,974
(leaves rustling)

572
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,770
(water trickling)

573
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,356
(light music)

574
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,783
(light music continues)

575
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:09,915
(groans)

576
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,752
(clicks tongue)

577
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,963
(glasses thud)

578
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,340
(sighs)

579
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,426
(soft music)

580
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,433
(soft music continues)

581
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,144
(sighs)

582
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,065
(soft music)

583
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,708
(soft music continues)

584
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,421
(exhales deeply)

585
00:29:58,672 --> 00:29:59,631
Come on in.

586
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,258
(music fades)

587
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,850
(door closes)

588
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,729
(footsteps approaching)

589
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:18,275
(soft thudding on table)

590
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,152
(sighs)

591
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,071
(clacks)

592
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,661
(light music playing)

593
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,583
(inhales)

594
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,626
(light music playing)

595
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,589
Do you really like it?

596
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,341
Does it look like it's advertising a bed,

597
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,177
not a washing machine
or an air-conditioner?

598
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,557
I tried to meet the client's needs
as much as possible.

599
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,186
(inhales deeply)

600
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,353
(sighs)

601
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:56,772
All right.

602
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,524
Since this is your first project as a PM,

603
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,235
take full responsibility
for the process and the result.

604
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:04,571
By the way,

605
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,991
the color of the brand logo is wrong.

606
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,038
No, it's not.

607
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,750
Look.

608
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,211
Do you see the difference
in brightness and chroma?

609
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,129
Didn't you check that?

610
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,674
And here.

611
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,260
Extend the last shot by 0.2 seconds

612
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,346
and add the copy.

613
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,806
Make the logo bigger too.

614
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,599
Okay?

615
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,768
(quirky music)

616
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,353
Ms. Hong.

617
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,522
Yes?

618
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,148
Go get changed.

619
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,150
What?

620
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,613
Are my clothes still tacky?

621
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:47,989
Well...

622
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,700
these are quite expensive
brand-name clothes though.

623
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,286
No, I mean...

624
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,247
Huh?

625
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:57,916
(gasps)

626
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,002
(groans)

627
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,005
(upbeat music)

628
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,090
(door opens)

629
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,180
(upbeat music continues)

630
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,311
Tissues. Tissues. Tissues. Hurry.

631
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,272
Tissues? Here, I've got some toilet paper.

632
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,983
(mumbling)
I'm bleeding a lot from the nose.

633
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,609
-Well...
-I need to hurry.

634
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,653
(stuttering)
You need to hurry? What...

635
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,407
Is she getting an urgent call of nature?

636
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,743
Anyway, stop...

637
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:35,787
(music stops)

638
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,714
RED BOMB

639
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,549
(can clinks)

640
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:49,593
(sighs)

641
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,762
(rattles)

642
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,975
(rustling)

643
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,936
(light music playing)

644
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,025
YEAR 2022 BILLY MARKETING PPM

645
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,157
(light music playing continues)

646
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:19,706
(music stops)

647
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,926
(director inhales)

648
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,220
If you put an air-conditioner
in that space,

649
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,971
it'd be an air-conditioner commercial.

650
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:38,141
And with a washing machine,
it'd be a washing machine commercial.

651
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,644
Doesn't it lack identity

652
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,938
as a bed commercial?

653
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,106
It's kind of ordinary.

654
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,108
(inhales)
Well, I think...

655
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,904
it's important
to make people curious about our brand.

656
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,907
What do you think, Mr. Cha?

657
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,996
You're right.

658
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,915
But highlighting nature

659
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,376
is something that
Billy has never tried before,

660
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,544
so I'm sure it'll bring
about the desired effect.

661
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:08,838
(in English)
Okay.

662
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,841
(in Korean)
I count on you, Mr. Cha.

663
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,554
(clears throat)

664
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,226
Shit.

665
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,020
(laughs softly)

666
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,063
Mr. Cha.

667
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,774
-I have high expectations for this.
-Thank you.

668
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,192
(laughs softly)

669
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,653
(exhales sharply)

670
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,364
It's Yesool who did the presentation.

671
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,741
Why do they want to sign
the contract with Mr. Cha?

672
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,078
He's been in charge of this brand
for years. It's only natural.

673
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,871
MINHEE: He surely is amazing.

674
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,083
You know, their attitude completely
changes when Master Cha is present.

675
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,752
(smacking lips)
Master Cha has the upper hand

676
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,796
even when deities are present.

677
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,881
Look at my chief.

678
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:54,259
He left as soon as the meeting ended.

679
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,927
-That cunning bastard.
-Exactly.

680
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,805
I think we can go home straight
from here today. No overtime work.

681
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:03,143
Go home and spend some time
with your parents, meet your lovers,

682
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,228
and do piled-up laundry.

683
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,730
(all cheer)

684
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,732
-Oh, wait. Wait.
-Now what?

685
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,526
We should throw a welcome party
for our intern before he'll get sulky.

686
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,361
-Do we have to do that too?
-Sanggoo will buy us meat!

687
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,197
(all cheer)

688
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,907
Yesool.

689
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,743
You'll come to the party, right?

690
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,119
Well...

691
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,164
-We'll do the shoot this weekend.
-(gasps)

692
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,082
What?

693
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,459
We'll have a meeting.
Let's go back to the office.

694
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,501
Well...

695
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,087
(sighs)
What the hell.

696
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,339
(stuttering)
What's going on?

697
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,298
(Eomji sobs)

698
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,382
What about the party?

699
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:36,509
Hong Yesool.

700
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:37,886
Follow me.

701
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:40,639
(exhales deeply)

702
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,932
I've got to go.

703
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,768
Sure. You go first.

704
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,811
(quirky music)

705
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,939
When did I say I'd buy you meat?
I never said that.

706
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,025
What do you know
about my savings account? Jeez.

707
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,277
(car whooshing)

708
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,533
YESOOL: What's going on?

709
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,535
Where is he taking me?

710
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,080
I didn't do anything wrong.

711
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,624
Mr. Cha. Where are we going?

712
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,168
What's the first prerequisite for an AE?

713
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,378
Pardon?

714
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,421
Oh.

715
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,757
Communication skills, sir.

716
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,302
But why do you not have them?

717
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,054
I did pretty well

718
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,681
with my presentation today, didn't I?

719
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:25,392
You were so nervous that you couldn't
even answer our client's questions.

720
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:26,601
And you think you did well?

721
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,021
That's because they asked you
all the questions

722
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,731
and didn't give me a chance to answer.

723
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,484
What's the second prerequisite for an AE?

724
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,364
-Planning and budgeting...
-Physical strength.

725
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,951
Build up your physical strength.

726
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,455
(gentle music)

727
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,792
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

728
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,756
See a doctor.

729
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,174
And then come back to the office.

730
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,427
What's wrong with him?

731
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,928
Did he eat something funny?

732
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,139
Aren't you getting out?

733
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,224
Oh, okay.

734
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,350
(clicks)

735
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,603
(car door opens)

736
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,858
(gentle music rises)

737
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,943
(engine revs)

738
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,196
(car whooshing)

739
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,325
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

740
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,620
How did he know
this is the hospital I go to?

741
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,665
(scoffs)

742
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,838
THANK YOU CONTACT THE PROPS
AND LIGHTING TEAMS TO CHECK...

743
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,303
(chuckles awkwardly)
I'm a little busy now.

744
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,679
(chuckles)

745
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,930
Ms. Hong Yesool.

746
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:49,517
This is my tenth time saying it.
You need to get more sleep.

747
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,187
I can't allow you to sleep less than this.

748
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,480
Never. Never.

749
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:56,399
I said "never" twice.
You know what that means, right?

750
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:58,818
Listen.

751
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:00,945
Insomnia.

752
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,781
Nervous breakdown.

753
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,075
You have both of these.

754
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,952
-(thudding)
-Having both of these

755
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,996
is really, really dangerous.

756
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:10,955
Really!

757
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,707
I said "really" twice too.

758
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,210
I'm fine, doctor. For God's sake.

759
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,419
(clears throat)

760
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,713
(laughs)

761
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,632
Well, Red Bomb.

762
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,509
Did you drink it or not?

763
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,221
Today? Yesterday? In the morning?
Or at night?

764
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,764
-When?
-(Seungtaek laughs)

765
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,683
You obviously drank it.
I told you many times not to drink it.

766
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,393
Something serious could happen

767
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,437
if you drink it
while you're on medication.

768
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,481
Don't you remember
what happened two years ago?

769
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,399
You were carried here
completely unconscious.

770
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:42,862
Gosh, this damn advertising company
is harsher than the medical industry.

771
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:47,283
And why do AEs
never listen to their doctors?

772
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,326
Why?

773
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,328
Do you have another AE as your patient?

774
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,287
Well...

775
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,122
(quirky music)

776
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,541
(sighs)

777
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:55,792
(inhales)

778
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,586
(chuckles awkwardly)
You aren't the only one

779
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,213
who cares about your health.

780
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,924
Please don't make me suffer anymore.

781
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,759
If you make
that son of a gun call me again...

782
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,094
That son of a gun?

783
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,723
Oh, nothing.
(chuckles awkwardly)

784
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:11,975
Well, it's nothing.

785
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,269
Don't drink Red Bomb and espresso.

786
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,645
Never, never.

787
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,856
Don't just take pep pills

788
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,816
from your drug packets
and get caught by me.

789
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,317
I won't. I won't.

790
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,237
I won't drink Red Bomb and coffee anymore.

791
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,780
I'll stop drinking them.

792
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,866
(quirky music)

793
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:29,659
Promise me.

794
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,121
(grunts)

795
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,247
Pop.

796
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,541
(can hisses)

797
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,087
(slurps)

798
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,006
(moans)

799
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,883
(exhales)

800
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,384
Wow.

801
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,428
(smacks lips)
This is what I want.

802
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,470
(groans)

803
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,181
(groans)

804
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,058
I can't stop drinking you, though.

805
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,228
-(scoffs)
-(sighs)

806
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:58,771
Hong Yesool.

807
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,774
Pull out of the Morphis campaign.

808
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,276
Wait, what?

809
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,195
I'm doing my best to be the PM
of that project too.

810
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,156
The proposal is almost complete.

811
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,158
I've been staying up several nights
to work on that one and the Billy project.

812
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,660
You can't even take care of your health.
You're not reliable.

813
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,995
But did I

814
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,247
ever mess with the plan?

815
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,832
I'm doing my best

816
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,125
to hang tough, you know?

817
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,377
Exactly. Don't hang tough. Just rest.

818
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,296
Wait, Mr. Cha.

819
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,839
(groans)

820
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,215
(screams)

821
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,384
(quirky music)

822
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,763
(grunts)

823
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,434
Damn it!

824
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,936
Damn it!

825
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,188
(screams)

826
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,732
-(screams)
-(groans in pain)

827
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,901
-Ms. Hong!
-(groans in pain)

828
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,612
-Are you okay?
-Oh, no.

829
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,073
Yes.

830
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,240
I'm fine.

831
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:55,119
I was just checking the continuity.
(sighs)

832
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,496
The bed.

833
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,040
Oh, it's so comfortable.

834
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,917
Redo the layout.

835
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,627
And contact the production team
to make sure that the lights are LEDs.

836
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,170
The layout? He's being ridiculous.

837
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,672
Readability, clarity,
and attractiveness. Consider all these.

838
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,298
Lights are LEDs? I want him to die.

839
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,633
Don't forget to highlight
the beauty of space.

840
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,801
The beauty of space? What a crazy jerk.

841
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:10,885
Lastly, contact the agency manager.

842
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:11,844
Should I beat him up and go to prison?

843
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,180
And get a written progress report.

844
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,140
Agency manager?
What should I do with that asshole?

845
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,725
THE LAYOUT? HE'S BEING RIDICULOUS
LIGHTS ARE LEDS? I WANT HIM TO DIE...

846
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,560
Oh, Ms. Hong.

847
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,396
Yes, Mr. Cha?

848
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,398
Go survey the shooting
location tomorrow morning.

849
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,524
With the AD.

850
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,692
A...

851
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,485
We'll make sure everything is okay.

852
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,112
(whispers)
Hey. Why me, all of a sudden?

853
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,239
Congrats.
(chuckles awkwardly)

854
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,448
(whispers)
You're the best.

855
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,908
(sighing)
Dang it.

856
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,536
-Did you write all that down?
-(employee chuckles)

857
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,372
-(sighs deeply)
-EOMJI: Why does he always speak so fast?

858
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,165
(grass rustling)

859
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,834
(indistinct chatter)

860
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,003
EOMJI: Hey, maybe Master Cha likes you.

861
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,879
Are you crazy?

862
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:47,797
Jeez.

863
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,632
That asshole wants to kill me.

864
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,176
He almost killed me on the stairs.

865
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,053
What happened? Did he push you?

866
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,223
(stuttering)
No.

867
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,683
It's not that.

868
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,018
(in a loud voice)
I think

869
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,562
you hate Master Cha for no reason.

870
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,855
Right?

871
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,899
Why would he help someone
he wants to kill build a career?

872
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,860
Oh, sir. Hello. Thank you
for your hard work. We'll do our best.

873
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:09,944
Hi.

874
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,656
EOMJI: Hey, you're the most successful
one among our colleagues.

875
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,242
None of us have a portfolio
as impressive as yours.

876
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,911
-Do I look like I'm successful?
-(camera shutter clicks)

877
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:22,498
Red Bomb and pep pills
make my head spin all the time.

878
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:25,043
Now all I have left are a gastric ulcer,
menstrual irregularity,

879
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,919
-and extreme insomnia.
-(camera shutter clicks)

880
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,046
(moans in frustration)

881
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:32,800
Hey, guys usually pick on girls
when they like them.

882
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,846
Then does he like everyone in our company?

883
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,264
He picks on just about everyone.

884
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,309
He just picks on me more often. That's it.

885
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,228
Wow! The view is amazing here. Wait. Stop.

886
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,563
One, two, three.

887
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,273
-(camera shutter clicks)
-Cut.

888
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,524
Gosh, it's so nice.

889
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,068
(scoffs)
Wait for me!

890
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,779
(indistinct chatter)

891
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:57,033
Hey, I suggest that you date someone.

892
00:42:57,617 --> 00:43:00,661
Spend some time with a guy on a bed

893
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,081
-so you can get some sleep.
-(sighs)

894
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,707
Hey, let's try to seduce someone

895
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,417
at our company's
upcoming anniversary party.

896
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,711
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

897
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,215
Media Team 2.
Assistant Manager Kim Choongmo.

898
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,383
He graduated from a prestigious university
and owns real estate.

899
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,677
Besides, his parents... live abroad.

900
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,597
Wow, wow!
(laughs)

901
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,265
He's perfect.
(snorts)

902
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,352
Goodness. My background is as good as his.

903
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,562
I don't care if his parents live abroad.
(scoffs)

904
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:27,688
(smacks lips)

905
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,565
My dear friend.

906
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,734
How long has it been...

907
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,073
since you used your tongue with a guy?

908
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,366
What?

909
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,201
(sighs)
How long...

910
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,955
(blubbering)
...has it been since your tongue...

911
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:49,127
(blubbering continues)
...last wrestled with a guy's tongue?

912
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,922
I mean, how long has it been
since you lied down on a bed

913
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,883
and did this with a guy?

914
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,849
I don't believe what guys say in bed.

915
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,061
I don't bet my life on such a fantasy.

916
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,857
I would rather bet on my abilities,
brain, and achievements.

917
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,567
It's good.

918
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,945
If I work hard, I get rewards.
Nothing is as rewarding as work.

919
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,281
(groans in frustration)
You're so inflexible.

920
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,324
(inhales deeply)
I want to kiss a guy so badly.

921
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,785
-"I love you, darling." And kiss. Bam.
-CHOONGMO: Ms. Jang.

922
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,162
-Oh, yes?
-There's something I need to ask you.

923
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:25,955
I'm coming. Oh, my back hurts.

924
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,043
(light music)

925
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:34,630
YESOOL: There were times when I thought

926
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,925
I could enjoy romance
if I put in the effort.

927
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,303
But...

928
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,722
(cell phone ringing)

929
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,225
(ringing continues)

930
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,479
Hello?

931
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,192
(car approaching)

932
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,446
(engine rumbling)

933
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,620
(engine revs)

934
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,084
(upbeat music)

935
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,800
(upbeat music continues)

936
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,386
JIYOUNG: I don't like things like this.

937
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,429
Ouch!

938
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,889
-Hey, be gentle.
-(Jiyoung moans)

939
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,182
-HAIRSTYLIST: I'm sorry.
-MANAGER: Are you okay, Jiyoung?

940
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,099
For goodness' sake.

941
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,727
YESOOL: Dealing with a mode
is one of the easiest tasks of an AE.

942
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,728
Let me see. You're fine, right?

943
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,480
YESOOL: And I've done it many times.

944
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,106
JIYOUNG: Are you sure this glittery thing
looks good on me?

945
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,775
MANAGER: Yes, it's pretty.
You look so beautiful.

946
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:36,817
Hello.

947
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,905
I'm AE Hong Yesool,
the PM of this Billy commercial.

948
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,658
(scoffs)

949
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,203
I guess I didn't complain hard enough.

950
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:51,123
The person in charge didn't come
but sent someone else.

951
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,128
(sighs)
When is Minhu, my darling, coming?

952
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,713
YESOOL: "My darling?"

953
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,300
-What's that supposed to mean?
-MANAGER: Have a seat.

954
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:02,551
Oh.

955
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,388
Mr. Cha is on his way here.

956
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,556
He said he'd be a little late,
so I came first.

957
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,476
I guess you have poor judgment.

958
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,062
You're making a commercial
with Oh Jiyoung,

959
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,438
but purity?

960
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,482
(scoffs)
I've never

961
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,651
tried such a concept since I was 22.

962
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,445
All the dramas and movies I was in
as a pure and innocent girl

963
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,448
completely bombed. Didn't you know?

964
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,200
What do you mean, bombed?
(soft chuckle)

965
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,244
I love "Hello Again,"
the one that you're in.

966
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,873
I personally love it when you appear
as a pure and innocent girl.

967
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,876
But unfortunately,
the theme of this commercial isn't purity.

968
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,629
It's just about you.
Oh Jiyoung as an individual.

969
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,880
(inhales)

970
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,883
(rustling)

971
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:48,764
We're also planning to hold

972
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:52,143
a social media event
where we sell a package of goods

973
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,729
that you use at night before going to bed.

974
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,814
JIYOUNG: What does this have to do

975
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,733
with the bed commercial?

976
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,820
People are curious to know
where you sleep and what you eat.

977
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,948
Things that you do before going to bed,
the tea that you drink,

978
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,783
and even the cosmetics that you use.

979
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,703
(inhales)
This event isn't just about the bed.

980
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,788
It's about Oh Jiyoung as well.

981
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:15,374
Through this commercial, you'll be able

982
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,918
to show the values of Oh Jiyoung
that people admire.

983
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,464
(sighs)

984
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,674
It's not bad.

985
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,803
Now I see why Minhu keeps you around.

986
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,514
(chuckles)
I'll take that as a compliment.

987
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,725
I'll get going then.

988
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,185
By the way, Ms. Hong.

989
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,312
What lipstick

990
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,189
do you use?

991
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,066
JIYOUNG: I like the color.

992
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,777
(ominous music)

993
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,574
YESOOL: Okay. Good.

994
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:52,495
(chuckles)
The one you use is a much better one.

995
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,580
Oh, Ms. Oh. Just a minute.

996
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,083
(upbeat music)

997
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,627
Hey, let's resume.

998
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,712
(upbeat music)

999
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,985
(upbeat music continues)

1000
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:39,834
Ms. Oh.

1001
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:40,709
(squeaks)

1002
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,336
(music stops)

1003
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,219
Oh, well...

1004
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,888
(stuttering)
Well, I was just...

1005
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,975
Oh, I got something for you.

1006
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,352
You said you liked
the color of my lipstick,

1007
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,687
so I bought one for you.

1008
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,106
I'll leave it there,

1009
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:03,899
so please continue what you were doing.

1010
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:06,861
(gasps)

1011
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,446
(grunts)

1012
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:10,072
(chuckles awkwardly)

1013
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,574
(quirky music)

1014
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,992
It flew.

1015
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,162
(exhales deeply)

1016
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,164
(chuckles awkwardly, groans)

1017
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,666
(stuttering)
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

1018
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,835
I'll leave right now.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1019
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,379
Ms. Oh. I'll see you
on the day of the shoot.

1020
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,630
Bye, Mr. Cha.

1021
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,549
I'll get going.

1022
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,469
-(hurried footsteps receding)
-(quirky music continues)

1023
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,014
Jiyoung. It's time to go.

1024
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,640
Go ahead and do the shoot.

1025
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:37,766
Minhu.

1026
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,312
Please check her hair once more.
Bring the dress too.

1027
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,396
The dress, please.

1028
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,108
What was that?

1029
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,027
What was he doing with Oh Jiyoung?

1030
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,945
By any chance, are they...

1031
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,823
(gasps)
They must be crazy.

1032
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:53,949
(scoffs)

1033
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,326
-Ms. Hong.
-(gasps)

1034
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,578
-What happened earlier was...
-It's all right.

1035
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:00,206
I'm the one who should be sorry
for ruining the mood.

1036
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:04,043
It's your private life.
I shouldn't have barged in like that.

1037
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,837
You're old enough, you know?

1038
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,673
There's nothing wrong
with kissing this girl and that girl.

1039
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,301
(inhales)
This girl and that girl? And what?

1040
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,762
No, nothing.

1041
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,847
(light music)

1042
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,477
I did it with that girl,

1043
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:23,145
but not with this girl.

1044
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,067
It's a misunderstanding,
so watch your mouth.

1045
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,151
All right?

1046
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,866
MINHU: Come back in.

1047
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,748
(breathes shakily)

1048
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,625
(gulps)

1049
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,834
(coughs)

1050
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,254
(horn honking)

1051
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,589
MINHEE: By the way, when is Yesool coming?

1052
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,508
She said she'd come, so I came too.

1053
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,511
This is my welcome party,
and you're not here for me?

1054
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:56,512
No.

1055
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,558
All Kim Minhee cares about is Hong Yesool.

1056
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,269
She's not interested in people like you.

1057
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:04,395
(scoffs)

1058
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,688
So...

1059
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,064
(taps)

1060
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,817
So are you getting used
to the planning team?

1061
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,485
How do you like the AE work?

1062
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,153
(moans uncertainly)

1063
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,823
You know AEs are the flower
of an advertising company.

1064
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,784
The flower is in full bloom.

1065
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,119
What do you think you're doing?

1066
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,996
That's not how you do it.
What the heck are you doing?

1067
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,706
That's right. AEs are like flowers.

1068
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,958
They get snapped off all the time.

1069
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,793
They gradually wither away and get dumped.

1070
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:28,794
Just like me.

1071
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,463
Did you say goodbye
to your parents and lover?

1072
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,134
Work-life balance, my foot.

1073
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,844
It's not easy for us
to have free time in the evening.

1074
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,345
Our life is all about overtime work.

1075
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,139
All right. Let's have a toast.

1076
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,432
(all cheer)

1077
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,350
-All right!
-SANGGOO: Bottoms up! Bottoms up.

1078
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,561
(all slurping)

1079
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,021
-YESOOL: It's not over yet, is it?
-EOMJI: I feel drunk.

1080
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,315
-I like it so much. I do. It feels good.
-ROMA: Wow!

1081
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,151
-MINHEE: What took you so long?
-SANGGOO: Go take those.

1082
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,029
-(Yesool sighs)
-(chuckles)

1083
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,281
(chuckles)
I haven't drunk for a while.

1084
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,241
(slurps)

1085
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,492
ROMA: By the way,

1086
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,412
why is Mr. Cha Minhu not here today?

1087
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,999
You know, it's the first
and last welcome party for me.

1088
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,167
Roma.

1089
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,837
Just like families and classes
have their own mottoes,

1090
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,339
our team has a motto too.

1091
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:14,798
That's right!

1092
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:18,135
Don't ever think of having a meal
with Mr. Cha.

1093
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,971
Our team never had a meal together
for the past five years.

1094
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,306
What?

1095
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,350
I'll give you some handy tips.
Write them down quickly.

1096
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:25,726
-Write them down.
-Okay.

1097
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,811
Don't talk too much
when Mr. Cha is present.

1098
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,730
Don't use your tongue but bring results.

1099
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,232
And when you're with Mr. Cha,
your memory is always wrong.

1100
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,234
Always write down what he says.

1101
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,819
Record it too if you can.

1102
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,863
MINHEE: You know what?

1103
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,615
Mr. Cha never meets people
outside of work.

1104
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,700
He neither has a hobby
nor belongs to a social club.

1105
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,911
Besides, it seems
that he's not seeing anyone.

1106
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:47,039
How does he figure out
the needs of every client?

1107
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,291
-I get goose bumps.
-"I get goose bumps."

1108
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,752
-He can read other people's minds.
-(munching)

1109
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,253
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

1110
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,381
You'll see that when you follow him
to presentations.

1111
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:58,342
He has the ability to shut people up
by figuring out what they'll say

1112
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,843
before they even open their mouths.

1113
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:02,054
-(exclaims)
-EOMJI: He even distinguished

1114
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,306
a heavy rain from a shower
during post-sync.

1115
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,642
-(Sanggoo chuckles)
-He's a five-sense freak who knows

1116
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,102
the color of every sound.

1117
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,604
Well, do sounds have different colors?

1118
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,439
(munches)
How would I know?

1119
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,482
(munching)

1120
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,193
-Ms. Hong has many abilities too.
-Huh?

1121
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,737
It was a commercial
for camping supplies last month.

1122
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,031
I wonder how she knew that
the model's outfit would be ripped.

1123
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:24,076
She prepared an extra,
so the shoot went very smoothly.

1124
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,495
(laughs)

1125
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,248
She's a precognition freak.

1126
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,875
She always says she foresees the future.

1127
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,211
I'm so sick of hearing her say that.
For goodness' sake.

1128
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:37,131
From now on, I'm just going
to follow you guys around.

1129
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,466
(laughs)
Don't do that.

1130
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,635
Mr. Cha doesn't take just anyone with him.

1131
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,847
Just follow me around.
I can take you with me. (laughs)

1132
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,640
-That's mine!
-You're daring.

1133
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,392
-This fellow is quite daring.
-(Sanggoo laughs)

1134
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,644
-EOMJI: Now I can see that.
-SANGGOO: All right! Let's have a toast!

1135
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,271
(all cheer)

1136
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,355
Just a second.

1137
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,233
-EOMJI: Rock! Yes!
-(Yesool sighs)

1138
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,736
KYUNGSEOK (on phone):
Gosh, we'll just set it up tonight.

1139
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,613
No, Mr. Yeom.

1140
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,031
Please follow the directions
on the manual.

1141
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:04,616
There's nothing impossible.

1142
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,536
Hey, everyone is on the set right now
to set up the bed.

1143
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,580
You can't set it up outside already.

1144
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,373
What if something happens
before the shoot tomorrow...

1145
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:14,626
Come on! Nothing will happen. Hey.

1146
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,171
If we set it up early tomorrow morning,

1147
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,673
everyone will be too tired
to do the shoot.

1148
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,216
Why are you so inflexible? Jeez.
(tuts)

1149
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,761
I told our staff that we'd set it up
early tomorrow morning.

1150
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,137
And that's what I notified Mr. Cha of...

1151
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,431
Hey! Forget it! All right?

1152
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,808
-But...
-I'll take care of it all,

1153
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:31,769
so don't worry!
(tuts)

1154
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:34,188
Sleep tight.
I'll see you at seven tomorrow.

1155
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,398
-For God's sake.
-(chimes)

1156
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,319
Here you go, darling.

1157
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,570
Oh.
(munches)

1158
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:44,781
(sighing)
Gosh.

1159
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,535
I'll have mercy on him
until tomorrow's shoot.

1160
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,372
Boy.

1161
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,458
What? Where did everyone go?

1162
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,335
Rock, paper, scissors.

1163
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,295
Yes!

1164
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:00,797
(rustling)

1165
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:02,549
(coughs)

1166
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,512
Hello.
(laughs)

1167
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,223
(crickets creaking)

1168
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,559
Hello!

1169
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,728
(laughs)
Take a break to have this.

1170
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,355
-(laughs)
-Here.

1171
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,732
The production team
will come soon to do a final check.

1172
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,068
Why do you guys keep coming?
You're on the planning team.

1173
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,861
Ms. Hong stopped by too a while ago.

1174
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,113
Well, this is my job.
(laughs)

1175
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,490
Boy, you're now a chief.
But you haven't changed at all.

1176
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,117
-You take care of everything from A to Z.
-(laughs)

1177
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,536
Guys.

1178
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,205
Mr. Cha brought some food for us.
Let's eat.

1179
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,331
-WORKER 1: Thank you.
-WORKER 2: Thank you.

1180
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,332
-Hello.
-Guys. Come.

1181
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,210
I've brought enough food for everyone.
Please help us until the end.

1182
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,128
Mr. Cha.

1183
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,675
If it doesn't look abundant enough,
we have more here, so add them.

1184
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,176
Okay. It looks good.

1185
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:47,803
(laughs softly)

1186
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,137
We just need to fill this.
Then we can go home.

1187
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:50,430
-Thank you for the food.
-Sure. Go ahead and eat.

1188
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,390
Yes.

1189
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,350
(exhales)

1190
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,107
(crickets creaking)

1191
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,067
(whooshing)

1192
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,027
(phone ringing)

1193
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:06,655
CHIEF CHA MINHU

1194
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,366
Gosh, why is this punk calling me again?

1195
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:11,994
Hi, Mr. Cha.

1196
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,829
Are you ready for the shoot tomorrow?

1197
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,790
I checked with the directing
and production teams and the models.

1198
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,501
I don't think there's going to be
any problem with the shoot tomorrow.

1199
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,420
You think? Or are you sure?

1200
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,049
Make sure there's no problem at all.

1201
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,011
(sighs)

1202
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,220
Okay.

1203
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:31,555
Oh, and Mr. Cha.

1204
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,057
Can you please take a look
at my project proposal

1205
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,267
for the Morphis Campaign...

1206
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,352
HONG YESOOL
CALL ENDED

1207
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,816
(crickets creaking)

1208
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:45,944
(sighs softly)

1209
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,280
(quirky music sting)

1210
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,448
(sighs)

1211
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,701
I need some sugar.

1212
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,787
(door lock clicking)

1213
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,461
(blows air)

1214
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,671
(slurps)

1215
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,507
(door lock beeping)

1216
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:10,302
(exclaims)
Ramyeon is filling.

1217
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,013
(screams)

1218
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:14,640
What are you doing here?

1219
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:16,725
What's up with you being at home?
You scared me.

1220
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,686
What's so scary about me being
at my mom's house?

1221
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,481
Please answer Auntie's calls, will you?

1222
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,817
She calls me from the US all the time
because you won't answer her calls.

1223
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,904
(slurps)
Okay.

1224
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,826
-(munches)
-(sighs)

1225
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,245
I was away from home for several days.

1226
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:38,747
But you didn't even care, did you?

1227
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:41,750
(munching)
I didn't come home for an entire week.

1228
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,043
Did you care?

1229
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:47,381
I'm sure you worked all night
with Cha Minhu.

1230
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,840
(clicks tongue)

1231
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,010
What's that?

1232
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,222
You don't know?
(sighs)

1233
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,557
(slurps)

1234
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:58,475
(mug thuds)

1235
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,853
You broke your promise with me again.
(sighs)

1236
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,356
I don't have much time left.
Don't you feel sorry for my life?

1237
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,401
You're mean.

1238
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,322
You're so mean.

1239
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,161
(grunts)

1240
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:21,456
GETTING A TATTOO (I THINK IT'LL HURT)
STAYING AT HOME FOR A WEEK

1241
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,918
(inhales, sighing)

1242
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,173
(soft thump)

1243
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,260
(clicks tongue)

1244
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,014
Are you mad?

1245
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:39,599
(rustling)

1246
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,477
Come on.

1247
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,981
I want to spend time with you too.

1248
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,567
When this campaign is over, let's...

1249
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:49,735
Yesool.

1250
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,528
Now,

1251
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,989
I don't have much time left.

1252
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,533
(sighing)
You know...

1253
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,202
what my future will be like.

1254
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,121
(inhales deeply)

1255
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,749
(exhales deeply)

1256
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,542
So what's your next mission?

1257
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,252
I'll do that with you.

1258
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,628
No.

1259
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,672
You can't do it.

1260
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,387
(breathes roughly)

1261
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,557
(inhales deeply)

1262
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,392
You still think so?

1263
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,519
(soft music)

1264
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,314
(laughs)

1265
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:30,025
(inhales)
Yesool.

1266
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,694
I love you, Yesool. Thank you!

1267
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,323
Oh, come on. Don't do that.
How many are these?

1268
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,616
(chuckles)

1269
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:38,784
Thank you.
(exclaims)

1270
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,410
For goodness' sake.
(grunts)

1271
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,579
I love you, Yesool.

1272
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,248
ZEU AD PLANNING TEAM 1,
ZEU AD PRODUCTION TEAM 1...

1273
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:46,458
(music stops)

1274
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:52,547
It's strange.

1275
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:55,008
Everything is set perfectly.

1276
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,968
Why do I have a bad feeling about it?

1277
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:58,970
(inhales)

1278
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,223
(quirky music)

1279
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,353
(scoffs)

1280
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,230
What was that?

1281
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,857
How could he play around with a girl
at our sacred workplace?

1282
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,901
What a douchebag.

1283
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,153
(exhales deeply)

1284
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,447
(sighs)
I should go to sleep.

1285
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,159
(grunts)

1286
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,037
(inhales deeply)

1287
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,581
But why can't I...

1288
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:30,210
(inhales)
...get to sleep?

1289
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:32,796
(snores)

1290
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:34,798

(cell phone ringing)

1294
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,347
CHIEF CHA MINHU

1295
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,517
My sixth sense.

1296
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:48,436
Cha the Jerk is calling me
at this hour of night?

1297
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,647
That means something has happened.

1298
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,941
(cell phone ringing)

1299
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:56,611
Hi, Mr. Cha. I'm on my way...

1300
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,489
What?

1301
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,324
(thunder rumbles)

1302
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:02,701
(rain pattering)

1303
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:06,788

01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,675
(moans)

1309
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,760
(rain pattering)

1310
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:26,808
PRODUCTION TEAM 1 CHIEF YEOM KYUNGSEOK
CALLING

1311
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:28,935
(line trilling)

1312
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,562
(sighs)

1313
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,398
Why isn't he picking up?

1314
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,568
PRODUCTION TEAM 1 CHIEF YEOM KYUNGSEOK
KIM MINHEE

1315
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,447
(dial tone trilling)

1316
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,490
How come none of them is picking up?

1317
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:44,951
(sighs)

1318
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:48,288
-Sir. Please go faster.
-DRIVER: Okay.

1319
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:50,957
(sighs)

1320
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,711
(sighing)
This is driving me crazy.

1321
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,840
(rain pattering)

1322
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,262
(sighs)

1323
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:06,348
(rain pattering)

1324
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,609
(panting)

1325
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,362
Mr. Cha.

1326
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,447
(thuds)

1327
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:24,991
-(panting)
-(glasses thud)

1328
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,578
(rain pattering)

1329
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,958
First, keep calling the production
and directing teams.

1330
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,252
-I'll help you.
-Call them first!

1331
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,258
(footsteps receding)

1332
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,430
(pants)

1333
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,516
(dial tone trilling)

1334
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,686
(rain pattering)

1335
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,524
(thunder rumbles)

1336
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,283
(thunder rumbles)

1337
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,745
I was able to reach
some of the people on both teams,

1338
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,330
and they're on their way here.

1339
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:13,456
(clacks)

1340
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,376
Who said you could set things up
like this?

1341
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,004
Just because you didn't want
to come an hour earlier,

1342
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,588
you put the bed outside?

1343
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,552
I checked the weather forecast.
It said nothing about rain.

1344
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,387
(sighs)

1345
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:29,681
And the production team
wouldn't listen to me.

1346
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,474
I'm just an assistant manager.

1347
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,268
Thinking that I know nothing
about technical things,

1348
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,186
both the production and directing teams
never follow my orders. You know that.

1349
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,313
Is making an excuse all you can do
in a situation like this?

1350
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:38,356
Mr. Cha.

1351
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,276
I'm on the planning team.
But production, marketing,

1352
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:44,237
and even odd jobs like this...
Why do I have to do all those?

1353
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,698
(sighs)
If you still don't know why,

1354
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,616
pull out of this campaign.

1355
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,495
(rattles)

1356
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,708
I'm sorry.

1357
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:01,504
Think about what you can do now
and tell me.

1358
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,426
When the production team arrives...

1359
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,261
Let's say you bring some people.
Then what?

1360
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,180
Can anyone replace you on this project?

1361
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,267
All you can do now

1362
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,062
is to bring someone and ask them
to take care of the mess you made?

1363
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,397
No, sir.

1364
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,192
I'll make a revision for the shoot.

1365
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:24,486
(sighs)
Good.

1366
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:30,700
(rain pattering)

1367
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,418
(thunder rumbling)

1368
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,298
(rain pattering)

1369
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,010
Mr. Cha.
(gasps)

1370
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,304
(shrieks)

1371
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:56,267
(thudding)

1372
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,897
(dramatic music)

1373
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,819
(rain pattering)

1374
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,321
(dramatic music rises)

1375
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,799
(dramatic music)

1376
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:29,467
(crashes)

1377
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,681
YESOOL: My sixth sense.

1378
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,600
I've never foreseen something like this.

1379
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,897
I foresaw a future
that should never happen.

1380
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,569
(tense music)

1381
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,329
(closing theme music)
