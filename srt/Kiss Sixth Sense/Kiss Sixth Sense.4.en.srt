1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,464
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,010
Let's break up.

3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,644
(sighs)

4
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:21,939
I said let's break up.

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,733
(dramatic music)

6
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,408
PILYO: Hong Yesool, you seriously...

7
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,870
(sighs)
Do you...

8
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,250
seriously not trust me? Is that why?

9
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,129
I told you.

10
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,967
We're bound to...

11
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,138
break up anyway.

12
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,105
YESOOL: I've thought of this before.

13
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,191
"Was this bound to happen?

14
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,947
Or did I make it happen?"

15
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,709
(moans)

16
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,420
(breathes deeply)

17
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,759
(ominous music)

18
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,430
(gasps)

19
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,434
How did I get here?

20
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,229
(theme music)

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,397
BIRTH OF ZELUS

22
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,865
-What's wrong with you?
-(laughs)

23
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,784
How are you going
to face me tomorrow, huh?

24
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,328
I see the future when I kiss someone.

25
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,663
Okay, sure.

26
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,539
I saw it.

27
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,210
You and I will be sleeping together
in the future.

28
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,005
So I wanted to double-check it.

29
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,883
-Double-check?
-Yes.

30
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,469
BASED ON THE WEBNOVEL
KISS SIXTH SENSE BY GOT W

31
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,471
WRITTEN BY JEON YURI

32
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,056
(sighs)

33
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:12,984
(gasps)

34
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,821
(gasps in surprise)

35
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,864
(sighs)

36
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,575
(pants)

37
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,705
(gasps)

38
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,960
(sighs)

39
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:35,924
(sighs)

40
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,844
Mr. Cha.

41
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,141
How much do you remember about last night?

42
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,184
You were the only one drinking.

43
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,311
(chuckles awkwardly)

44
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,566
Then you must remember everything
I said last night,

45
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,859
so I'll cut to the chase.

46
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,779
Fine. So you can see the future?

47
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,408
-It sounds absurd, but...
-And...

48
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,786
you saw us sleeping together
in the future?

49
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,956
I'm sure it's hard to believe,
but we really are...

50
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,666
That's why you...

51
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,336
you tried to kiss me that night
at my house.

52
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,214
(sighs)

53
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,633
And

54
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,635
last night too.

55
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,265
But you kissed me first last night.

56
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,516
I'm sure you...

57
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,978
So I wanted to double-check it.

58
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,772
Can I?

59
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,692
-Well, that was...
-(sucks air)

60
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,736
Do you have feelings for me?

61
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:38,904
Pardon?

62
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,283
(scoffs)
I'm not interested in you at all.

63
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,118
Exactly! So how do we...

64
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,746
end up, you know?

65
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,834
So I have no idea how we get that far
and it's driving me crazy.

66
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,588
But what I saw is true.

67
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,884
Somehow we'll end up like that.

68
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,678
(sighs)

69
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,434
(rustling)

70
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,104
Here.

71
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,734
Well...
(sighs)

72
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,236
You do have to go to work, you know.

73
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,114
Get changed.

74
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,617
(quirky music)

75
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,621
(door opens)

76
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,500
(door closes)

77
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,670
(sighs)

78
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,428
(light music)

79
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,485
AUTOMATED VOICE: Going down.

80
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,445
(sighs)

81
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,455
So, can you really see the future
if you kiss someone?

82
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,001
I mean, what have you been
listening to all along?

83
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,713
Then when we kissed last night

84
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,425
in my car,

85
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,094
what did you see?

86
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,515
Umm.

87
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,434
(quirky music)

88
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,060
Oh!

89
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,771
Huh?

90
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,733
(exhales uncertainly)

91
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,985
What? You didn't see anything?

92
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,361
Well...

93
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,199
I do see the future when I kiss someone.

94
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,868
It happens consistently

95
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,622
but I guess I just can't remember.
I'm not sure what's going on...

96
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,248
(scoffs)

97
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,750
(elevator dings)

98
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,210
(exhales deeply)

99
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,296
(dramatic music)

100
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,069
(sighs deeply)

101
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,362
AUTOMATED VOICE: Going down.

102
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,995
(breathes deeply)

103
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,795
Mr. Cha Minhu, I didn't get
a chance to say hello last night.

104
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,297
-I'm Lee Pilyo.
-Oh, I'm Cha Minhu.

105
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,799
I don't have a business card on me.

106
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,967
-I'll introduce myself properly next time.
-Sure.

107
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,597
(sighs)

108
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,017
I'm staying on the sixth floor
of this hotel.

109
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:00,230
(inhales)
Their breakfast is great here.

110
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,565
I often have meetings here too.

111
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,609
The advertising industry
must be pretty demanding too.

112
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,027
You're starting out so early
in the morning.

113
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,404
(chuckles)

114
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,530
(elevator dings)

115
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,031
We'll get going.

116
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,328
(dramatic music)

117
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,302
(shoes screech)

118
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,013
SEUNGTAEK: Huh? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

119
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,892
(stuttering)
What are you doing here at this hour?

120
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,477
(sighs)

121
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,731
YESSOL: How many people are we running
into in this hotel?

122
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,194
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
The two of you...

123
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,738
The two...

124
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,197
Why are you two here?

125
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,867
(quirky music)

126
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,828
Oh. Oh!

127
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,957
You must be working off-site. Off-site.
I'm making a house call here.

128
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,084
-I got a call from the hotel today.
-Bye.

129
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,335
Oh, okay.

130
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,840
Bye.

131
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,598
Is he nuts? Huh?

132
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,725
-Boo!
-Hey, you startled me.

133
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,685
(giggles)

134
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,187
Should we get some breakfast?

135
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,898
Sure. Shall we?

136
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,524
-Let's go.
-Okay.

137
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,492
(chuckles)

138
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,787
You know, I don't usually do this.

139
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,999
I'm actually a very discreet person.
But last night was...

140
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,834
Are you busy this week?

141
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:46,711
Sorry?

142
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,547
Do you plan to get hospitalized,
move out of the country, or get married

143
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,924
this week?

144
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,134
What did you say?

145
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,303
Anyway, if you've got
nothing else going on,

146
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,972
do you want to go out with me?

147
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,265
(clanks)

148
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,142
Just for a week.

149
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,560
Passionately.

150
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,816
(quirky music)

151
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,697
After you left like that last night,
everyone's wondering

152
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,825
if you've got something going on
with Lee Pilyo.

153
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,160
It's him, huh? Lee Pilyo.

154
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,745
Your ex-boyfriend.

155
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,081
(sighing)
Yeah.

156
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,207
(sighs)

157
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,335
(sobs)
What a persistent bond.

158
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,629
You went through so much
crying your heart out.

159
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,631
And to bump into him like this...

160
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,261
Cha Minhu on the right
and Lee Pilyo on the left.

161
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,762
Is this a drama or something?

162
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,765
So, which one?
Which channel should I watch?

163
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,434
-Don't change the channel!
-Neither one of them.

164
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,770
So that's what Mr. Cha said?

165
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,231
(stuttering)
Well, it is...

166
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,108
(gasps)
Yesool!

167
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,819
Isn't this a Lisa?

168
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,280
Huh? Oh, yes. It is.

169
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,074
I pretty much have to give away
my entire month's salary

170
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,909
so I only had my eye on it.

171
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,495
-And it's a new collection at that!
-Hmm.

172
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,164
When did you buy it?

173
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,209
(inhales)
Do you want some chocolate?

174
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,837
No thanks. I'm going on a diet.

175
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,339
Minhee is so interested in fashion.

176
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,632
An amazing person.

177
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,342
-EOMJI: Get back to work.
-MINHEE: Okay.

178
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,636
Oh, I came for some tea.

179
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,138
(tuts)

180
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,140
(sighs in frustration)

181
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,225
(tuts)

182
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,480
Oh, no. Mr. Cha bought it.

183
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,692
-Minhu did?
-Yeah.

184
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,445
He called me early this morning
and took it,

185
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,363
even telling me the exact size.

186
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,824
Including heels. The whole shebang.

187
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,537
Jiyoung, because you spent
too much time overseas,

188
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,456
your schedule is very tight.
I'll get you the outfit later...

189
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,665
Hey! Shit.

190
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,585
Do you think he bought it for you?

191
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,964
Come to think of it,
it wasn't your size, though.

192
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,177
Oh, no.

193
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,554
He did get it for me.

194
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,975
But how can you not remember
your VIP's size?

195
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,769
(chuckles)

196
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,604
What are you saying?

197
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,232
Your shoe size is 235 mm, hon.

198
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,985
I remember clearly.
The ones he took this morning were 240 mm.

199
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,615
You can't spill my personal info
just like that.

200
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:26,246
(scoffs)
And why am I your "honey"?

201
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,622
-(inhales)
-(Jiyoung tuts)

202
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,665
(clears throat)

203
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,250
(scoffs)

204
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,418
(sighs)

205
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,879
I think I'm going to stop shopping here.

206
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,548
Bye.

207
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,759
(sighs deeply)

208
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,637
(Sanggoo inhales deeply)

209
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,682
SANGGOO: If the target audience
is in the 20s and 30s...

210
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,768
Then isn't it someone like me,
a young professional starting out?

211
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,812
Something like,
"Rooting for the golden youth."

212
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,356
No, this car isn't for people
who are just starting out.

213
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,026
It's for young bosses
who were born with silver spoons.

214
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,820
It's insanely expensive.

215
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,868
(exclaims)
This car is so sexy.

216
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,413
It makes me want to ram into it. Goodness.

217
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,831
(sighs)

218
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,000
Ms. Jang.

219
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,501
Yes?

220
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,670
You're not even on our team.
Why are you always here?

221
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,005
I'm just curious. Really.

222
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,340
Gosh, you complain
even when I come to help out.

223
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,883
What's wrong with you?

224
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,678
Actually, V9 is pricy,

225
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,888
but I think we can go trendy
and appeal to young people.

226
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,515
-Car camping is in these days.
-(sighs)

227
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,684
How about we keep the wheels
turning in that direction?

228
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,852
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

229
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,103
Car camping...

230
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,732
What if a car turns into a bed?

231
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,817
EOMJI: Huh. Hmm.

232
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,278
I just came up with that.
Did you see that?

233
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,196
I can come up with the copy right away.
(snorts)

234
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,865
-Ms. Jang.
-Yes?

235
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,242
That's like the idea you came up
with for Billy.

236
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,077
What's wrong with you these days?

237
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,954
Do you have something
boiling inside of you?

238
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,374
(inhales)
I mean, what can't you do in that car?

239
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,043
There's a bed.

240
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,669
A guy and music.

241
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,715
What more do you need in that tight space?

242
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,133
Haven't you done it?

243
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,469
No?

244
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:08,765
You guys have never done it in a car?

245
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,768
I mean, you honestly haven't done it?
You'd better be straight with me.

246
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,894
Well, actually,

247
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,813
I had my first kiss in my boyfriend's car.

248
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,482
(laughs, mutters)

249
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,110
That's what I'm saying.
The day you kiss in a car,

250
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,155
-you go straight to a hotel. Jeez.
-Come on, sit down.

251
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,532
(sniffles)

252
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,453
EOMJI: Jeez.

253
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,746
(clears throat)

254
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,540
The most private and secretive space.

255
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,627
A space for two that stimulates
all five senses.

256
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,711
(inhales deeply)

257
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,880
I love it. I really like it.

258
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,423
What do you think, Ms. Hong?

259
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,800
Good, huh?

260
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,009
(mouthing)
Say you like it.

261
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,552
Well...
(chuckles awkwardly)

262
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,137
Let's wrap up the meeting here.

263
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,431
Let's put everything down on paper
and set up another meeting.

264
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:55,269
Except don't throw everything out there
that you can't justify.

265
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,065
Let's not pull together something
that sounds so unbelievably ridiculous

266
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,858
that you can't be accountable for.

267
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,068
Please take responsibility

268
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,946
for every sentence
that's written up in the proposal.

269
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,323
Only write down things
that are convincing.

270
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,159
"I don't care if I use the backspace key
to delete it."

271
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,494
I hate this type of attitude.

272
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,037
-The end.
-(taps on table)

273
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,288
SANGGOO: Okay.

274
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,792
(door opens)

275
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,919
He always says that when I say something.

276
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,504
(tuts)
Shit.

277
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,008
I'll prove it.

278
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,639
You don't believe me. Right?

279
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,182
That I can see the future.

280
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,601
(sighs)
And what you said after that.

281
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,436
Let me prove it to you.

282
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,063
I'll make you believe me.

283
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,481
Let's meet after work.

284
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,859
By the way,

285
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,987
when did you start wearing perfume?

286
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,530
What?

287
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,617
Did you wear the same perfume
on the day of the Billy shoot?

288
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,327
I don't use perfume.

289
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,747
(door opens)

290
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,584
-(door closes)
-(sniffs)

291
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,672
How come I don't feel sick?

292
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,675
How come...
(sucks air)

293
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,802
How come I'm feeling fine?

294
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,472
(quirky music)

295
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,523
MINHU: It's weird.

296
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,358
My...

297
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,277
darling.

298
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,320
HOWOO

299
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,406
Man, Cha Minhu, that jerk.
His timing sucks.

300
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,741
Damn it!
(tuts)

301
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,825
(deep inhale)

302
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,746
Hey, I know you think it's really weird
but at the hotel earlier, I was just...

303
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,830
MINHU (on phone): Hey.

304
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,582
-Did you change my medication?
-SEUNGTAEK (on phone): Huh?

305
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,251
Why? Did you faint again?

306
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,712
No. I'm feeling fine. That's why.

307
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,924
If my symptoms disappeared suddenly,
could I be cured naturally?

308
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,801
What? You have no symptoms?

309
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:51,761
MINHU (on phone): No.

310
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,722
To be exact, I had them,
but they disappeared.

311
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,103
(moans in pain)

312
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,859
(faint laughter)

313
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,319
(moans in pain)

314
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,158
(heart beats)

315
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,912
(laughing continues)

316
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,546
(pants)

317
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,925
Where is it?

318
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,719
(exhales deeply)

319
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,471
(groans)

320
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,393
Hold it.

321
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,520
(panting)

322
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,107
How much does she weigh?
Don't move! Don't move.

323
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,066
Don't move.

324
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,735
(panting)
Here it is.

325
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,862
(panting)

326
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,657
(grunts)

327
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,451
(pants)

328
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,122
Holy crap!

329
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,624
(breathes deeply)

330
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,293
-What is it?
-It's hot.

331
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,920
What? No, wait a minute! Wait!

332
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,172
-(Minhu groans)
-(Yesool moans)

333
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,427
(Minhu continues panting)

334
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,013
(moans)

335
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,431
(groans in relief)

336
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:19,932
Man.

337
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,727
(sighs)

338
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,440
(Minhu pants)

339
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,819
(sighs)

340
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,454
(Minhu breathes heavily)

341
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,926
(breathes deeply)

342
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,729
(breathes rapidly)

343
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,106
MINHU: Wait a minute...

344
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,902
What's happening?

345
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,489
(pensive music)

346
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,332
SEUNGTAEK (on phone):
Hey, Cha Minhu. Hey.

347
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,626
Why aren't you saying anything?
Answer me. Minhu. Hey.

348
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,637
Email it to me when you're done.

349
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,476
(sighs)

350
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,071
(sighs)

351
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,116
YESOOL: Think before you do
anything, you moron.

352
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,870
Should I just take it back,
saying I was kidding?

353
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,123
(smacking lips)

354
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,752
Mr. Cha, I think I just rambled
on earlier...

355
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,212
MINHU: How are you going to prove it?

356
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,552
YESOOL: Let's meet in the reference room
right now.

357
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,470
LET'S MEET AT THE REFERENCE ROOM
RIGHT NOW

358
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,605
Excuse me for a moment.

359
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,443
-What?
-(smooches)

360
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,991
Dr. Oh Seungtaek is in your room.

361
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,535
That's because he's a friend. Of course.

362
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,245
I can guess stuff like that myself.

363
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,372
I think you'll work late again tomorrow.

364
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,042
Dr. Seungtaek has a nosebleed.

365
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,754
Perhaps you two are going to beat up
on each other and fight?

366
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,214
(sighs)

367
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,258
You still don't believe me, do you?

368
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,801
Excuse me again.

369
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,053
(smooches)

370
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,310
What is it?

371
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,188
You and me...

372
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,440
Are we in another country? Is it a desert?

373
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,443
I don't know where we are.

374
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,571
Is it dust or sand?

375
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:25,034
Anyway, we're standing
in the middle of nowhere.

376
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,745
Are we shooting a commercial?

377
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,499
Well, I don't even know
when this is, either.

378
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,168
It's not like I can see everything
just because I want to.

379
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,217
(smooches)

380
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,803
(dramatic music)

381
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,355
Where is this now?

382
00:21:55,898 --> 00:22:00,903
Anyway, I trip over something,
and you hold me.

383
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,447
And because of that, your cellphone screen

384
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,242
-cracks.
-What?

385
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,493
(sighs)

386
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,870
I'm also annoyed and feel wronged.

387
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,331
I wish I could see
the winning lottery numbers

388
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,292
or something grand and movie-like.

389
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,419
All I see are useless
and worthless things.

390
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,256
-What? Worthless?
-Think about it.

391
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,341
It gets me anxious
and causes misunderstanding.

392
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,969
Standing here talking to you like this

393
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,221
is also thanks to my damn ability.

394
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,639
What? Damn?

395
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,518
Then what did you see
when you were in my car that night?

396
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,939
(groans in frustration)

397
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,899
Well, I really don't know
about that night.

398
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,153
But anyway, I proved it to you.

399
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,615
It's up to you
whether you'll believe me or not.

400
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,129
Huh? I'm not in any pain.

401
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,094
(Howoo moans)
Really?

402
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,558
If Seungtaek is happy, Howoo is happy too.

403
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,351
SEUNGTAEK (on phone):
If my Howoo is happy,

404
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,478
that makes me happier.

405
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:23,485
Huh. But we're going out only for a week
when we're so happy together?

406
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,237
My goodness!

407
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,072
What is it? What happened?

408
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,909
Were we on the phone for 13 hours?

409
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:36,165
Umm, I almost burned my face.

410
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,374
SEUNGTAEK (on phone): Oh, no.

411
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,711
Oh, my baby shouldn't get a burn.

412
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,422
Should I run over to you right now?
(giggles)

413
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,633
Run over. Come on...

414
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,051
(door opens)

415
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,638
SEUNGTAEK (on phone): Hello? Hello?

416
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,306
Howoo, did you fall asleep...

417
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,811
-What's going on?
-Huh?

418
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,065
What? Huh?
Aren't you here to talk about that?

419
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,358
Did you do it with Cha Minhu?

420
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,945
(sighs)
We only kissed.

421
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,571
What?

422
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,741
You only kissed at a hotel? That's it?

423
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,535
(scoffs)
Are you crazy? Are you still a kid?

424
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,079
How can you possibly stop there?

425
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,414
By the way,

426
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,584
was I unable to see the future
if I got drunk?

427
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,878
Gosh, no way.

428
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,546
Don't you remember
what happened with Pilyo?

429
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,175
You said you didn't have the guts,
so you got drunk and kissed him.

430
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,886
Then you bawled,
saying you saw the future.

431
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,555
You were an emotional mess then.

432
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,641
I was.

433
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,811
Being as smart as I am,
I realized it then.

434
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,187
(sighs)

435
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,606
"You have to know
when to end a relationship.

436
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:46,360
Long-term relationships
could get messy like that."

437
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,865
So I'm only going out with him for a week.

438
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,368
Huh?

439
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,787
-With whom?
-Don't know.

440
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,624
-Huh? Spill it. Who?
-(chuckles)

441
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,335
-I won't tell you.
-Tell me. Spill it. Who is it?

442
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,546
Nope!

443
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,715
-Oh-ho?
-(giggles)

444
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,696
(pensive music)

445
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:36,076
YESOOL: I'm sure it's hard to believe,
but in your room, we really are...

446
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:49,590
Gosh, so annoying. I revised it 20 times.

447
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,883
(sighs)

448
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:55,721
I seriously have updated
the file name 20 times.

449
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,556
But he wants to go
for the first one, right?

450
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,974
How did you know?

451
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,811
He asked me to write up more,
saying he wanted to see more variations.

452
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,022
Gosh, I want to put up a barricade
and thrash him.

453
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,231
(soft chuckle)

454
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,901
I think you can reveal
the design just slightly

455
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,362
and emphasize the functionality instead.
Look at these references.

456
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,822
(exhales deeply)

457
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,995
Yesool, I guess we're really working
with Director Lee Pilyo.

458
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,918
I noticed that you two
were standing together

459
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,920
from the pictures
at the anniversary party.

460
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,505
Do you know each other?

461
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,258
You do, huh?

462
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,843
Get back to work.

463
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,556
(snickers)

464
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,849
I'm right.

465
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,316
I'm sure you had many other offers,

466
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,026
but why did you choose us...

467
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,529
PILYO: Because you're highly reputable.

468
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,739
I've wanted to work with you.

469
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,449
(chuckles)

470
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,742
And I also have...
(sighs)

471
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,329
...personal reasons
that I don't want to regret later.

472
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,791
(exhales)

473
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,712
I've only worked in the film industry,

474
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,340
so I'm apprehensive about working
in this unfamiliar field.

475
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,468
Everyone says that I'm a genius
and whatnot.

476
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,762
But I'm actually a wimp. Timid too.

477
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,683
(sucks air)
So I think I'll need a manager.

478
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,560
A manager?

479
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,396
I thought it'd be good to have someone
to ask questions,

480
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,273
who can help me out.

481
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,067
I was wondering if I could ask
Ms. Hong Yesool to do that for me.

482
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,153
I really liked the Billy commercial.

483
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,155
Hmm.

484
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,994
Ms. Hong will be overseeing
the entire Mopix project.

485
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,914
Please feel free to contact anyone
on Planning Team 1 if you need anything.

486
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:49,668
And if you still need a manager,
I can do that for you.

487
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,128
But you're busy.

488
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,005
I've watched all your interviews.
So I know.

489
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,508
You're on your way to becoming ZEU AD's
youngest executive director.

490
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,135
(chuckles awkwardly)

491
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,971
I'm inadequate in many ways,
so I'll need a lot of help.

492
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,055
But...

493
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,975
I would never embarrass you

494
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,352
with something that has my name on it.

495
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,729
So don't worry about that.

496
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,607
(dramatic music)

497
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,450
So I ask that we do not mess
with each other's domain,

498
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,744
our own professional domain.

499
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,203
(chuckles)

500
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,039
I hope that applies
to you as well, Director,

501
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,959
the respect you have for our domain.

502
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,296
As you all know,
this is Director Lee Pilyo

503
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,632
who will be working with us
on the Mopix project.

504
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,803
-This is Planning Team 1's...
-Mr. Kang Sanggoo.

505
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,056
The coffee commercial
that was a big hit three years ago.

506
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,432
I still remember that.

507
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,101
I switched to that coffee
after watching that commercial.

508
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,228
Oh, thank you.

509
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,147
Ms. Kim Minhee.

510
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,524
The recent Fancy ad slogan
that went viral was great.

511
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,692
(soft gasp)

512
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,154
Mr. Kim Roma. I always
enjoy watching your vlogs.

513
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,073
I subscribed to your channel
and clicked "like."

514
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:03,992
And...

515
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,871
Ms. Hong Yesool.
(sighs)

516
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,666
Do you know the Billy commercial
was the reason

517
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,334
I decided to take on this project?

518
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,714
And the new V9 about to launch,

519
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,842
I'd like to check the shooting location
and take the car for a test drive.

520
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,470
It hasn't been launched yet,

521
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,430
so we must abide by the security
and confidentiality policy.

522
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,849
Launching a new model
is still kept under wraps...

523
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,937
As you know, I'm not good
at filming things I don't know about.

524
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,731
You know that I personally
check out places I have to film

525
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,067
and use the products I'll be filming.

526
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,326
I saw one of your interviews.

527
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,871
You had lied down in a coffin
for 15 hours to shoot a short film.

528
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:50,914
-(chuckles)
-SANGGOO: Oh.

529
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,959
Oh, well... isn't there a way?
It's not like this never happened before.

530
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,210
Should I look into it? Huh?

531
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,839
I'm very creative and adventurous.

532
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,717
I think I can picture it
if I go to the location myself.

533
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,719
PILYO: Will that be possible?

534
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,972
I'll prepare for that.

535
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,938
PILYO: A handshake. Don't you know?

536
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,566
-(indistinct chatter)
-Let's do a good job.

537
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,484
As a director and staff.

538
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,613
(birds chirping)

539
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,828
(mutters)

540
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,248
You asked for a handshake.
Why are you holding my hand?

541
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,000
Why would I shake your hand?

542
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,334
I'd rather hold your hand.

543
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,086
No, just let go.

544
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,130
Just walk.

545
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,971
(chuckling)
A handshake. Don't you know?

546
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,433
I said let's do a good job,
Ms. Hong Yesool.

547
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,644
(light music)

548
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,323
-(heart beats)
-(pensive music)

549
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,162
(sighs)

550
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,417
(sighs softly)

551
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,549
MINHU: Will you drag
your personal feelings into your work?

552
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,304
I'm not sure what you mean...

553
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,099
Whatever your personal reasons may be,

554
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,310
if you let your feelings drag you around
throughout this campaign,

555
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,770
I'll take you out.

556
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,856
Gosh, what do you take me for...

557
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,317
I can see that you still have
a lot of feelings for him

558
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:46,321
enough to throw you off like this
ever since the anniversary party.

559
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,031
No, that's not it.

560
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,158
It's not because I still have a lot
of feelings for him.

561
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,368
Then...

562
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,287
do something about
the sound of your heartbeat.

563
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,123
It's so loud.

564
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,084
(quirky music)

565
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,588
-(door opens)
-He can hear?

566
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,298
(door closes)

567
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,883
What's he talking about?

568
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,011
My goodness.

569
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,054
BIRTH OF ZELUS

570
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,139
(sighs)

571
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,685
(slurps)

572
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,230
(somber music)

573
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,072
(scoffs)

574
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:31,867
(sighs deeply)

575
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,244
I knew you'd be here.

576
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,206
You always came here
when you were angry and upset.

577
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:43,503
When you were frustrated,
happy, or excited too.

578
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,549
We always came here together.

579
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,345
(chuckling)
Wow.

580
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,723
I can't believe this is still here.
(laughs)

581
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,974
Did you see this?

582
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,102
I guess we really are successful.

583
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,732
We even get to shoot Hong Yesool's
dream commercial together.

584
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,651
Why did you come here?

585
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:08,778
Just because.

586
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:12,324
I came because I missed you.
And here you are.

587
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,075
I'm happy.

588
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,828
It's not like we just broke up yesterday.

589
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,538
I know, right?

590
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,291
But it feels like it was just yesterday.
(chuckles)

591
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,959
Do you feel the same way?

592
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,339
Stop it.

593
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,926
I'm not the same person I was then.

594
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,803
You're not the same person
you were then, either.

595
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,597
Come on. Just because I got an award,

596
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,183
it doesn't mean that I'm not the person
you used to know.

597
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,851
(sighs)

598
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,023
I don't know why you chose
to work with ZEU AD.

599
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,734
No, I don't even want to know.

600
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,111
I hope you don't let your
personal feelings and our past

601
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,279
get in the way of our work.

602
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,530
Be professional.

603
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,283
25.73 million won.

604
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,873
The stuff you broke
in my studio apartment.

605
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,001
It roughly came out to be that much.

606
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,963
Jeez, I wish you didn't break Teica MP.

607
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,298
You knew I went through a lot to get it.

608
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,093
Well, you knew.
That's probably why you broke it.

609
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,052
Boy.

610
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,264
How could you destroy
only the things that I treasure?

611
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,556
(chuckling)
That's a skill.

612
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,558
Why are you bringing that up now?

613
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:26,064
Well, I want to get a new Teica MP,

614
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,108
but I still can't find one.

615
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,068
Man, I should've taken a picture of it.

616
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,779
By chance, are you asking me
to pay for that?

617
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,781
Three dates.

618
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,202
Let's go on just three dates.

619
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,162
What?

620
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,999
I'll forget about the Teica MP.

621
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,959
Just go on three dates with me.

622
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,044
Are you threatening me right now?

623
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,504
No.

624
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,048
I'm clinging to you,
trying to get you back.

625
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,676
Let's go on just three dates.

626
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,429
Between you and me, that much...

627
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,225
You can do that much for me, can't you?

628
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,982
DAEHANRO

629
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,401
HOWOO: We only have four days left,
so let's do as many things

630
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,028
as other couples do in four years, okay?

631
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,322
Howoo, it's not like
our relationship is terminal.

632
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,198
Why do you keep saying
such horrible things?

633
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,077
From here to here.

634
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,537
We'll hit
all the popular date spots, okay?

635
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,497
Hey, we can't go to all these places
all at once.

636
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:25,624
We can do it.

637
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,297
(chuckles awkwardly)

638
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,966
Shall we go shopping first?

639
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,093
Wow, this looks so cool.
(laughs)

640
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,012
(shouts in surprise)
Huh? What? What? What?

641
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,096
Seungtaek, put that back.

642
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,516
How about this one? No, not this one.

643
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,394
-Howoo, I like this one.
-No, that one looks weird, Seungtaek.

644
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,688
What do you think? Looks cute, huh?

645
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:49,939
(chuckling)
I look weird in pink.

646
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,150
Looks nice. It looks good on you.
Let's go.

647
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,068
Gosh.

648
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,320
(sighs)
Whatever.

649
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,573
(Howoo cheers)

650
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,533
-Wow!
-Nice! Yeah!

651
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,535
-What the heck? You said you're bad!
-(cheers)

652
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,371
One, two.

653
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,081
SEUNGTAEK: Go!

654
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,750
(both cheer)

655
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,798
Here.

656
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,758
-Say ah.
-Ah.

657
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,219
Ah. Mmm.

658
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,554
-(exclaims)
-How do you like it?

659
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,181
-Delicious. It's delicious.
-It is?

660
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,433
(slurps)

661
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,812
-Oh, come on.
-(both laugh)

662
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,940
PLAYING BOWLING
FEEDING MY BOYFRIEND

663
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,866
(moans)

664
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:44,452
(moans)

665
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,874
-(gasps)
-(both scream)

666
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,668
(man breathes deeply)

667
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,837
Sorry. We're sorry. We're sorry.
What's wrong?

668
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,130
A nightmare. I had a nightmare.

669
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,464
-You had a nightmare?
-Yeah.

670
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,007
Chicken feet. And a glass of soju.

671
00:36:58,091 --> 00:36:59,509
-Should we get some?
-Let's go.

672
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,636
-Okay!
-(laughs)

673
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,392
Huh?

674
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:15,316
♪ I get on the floor ♪

675
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,945
-♪ Baby, it's only you ♪
-(Howoo yelps)

676
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:25,535
♪ Counting up the years ♪

677
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:29,164
♪ You're the only one for me ♪

678
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,206
(groans)

679
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,251
(music fades)

680
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,295
(breathes deeply)

681
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,423
-It's okay.
-Mmm.

682
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,383
(both sigh)

683
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,429
Come.

684
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,432
Mmm.

685
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,978
-It's okay.
-I'm not usually like this.

686
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:55,148
(dog barking in distance)

687
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,318
Here we are.

688
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,652
-Is this your place?
-Yeah.

689
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,363
-(clears throat)
-Give me that.

690
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,364
Huh?

691
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,824
Hmm?

692
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,787
Mmm.

693
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,246
(laughs softly)

694
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,374
Bye.

695
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,337
Goodness. What are you doing?

696
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,088
-(shouts)
-My goodness.

697
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,508
-(shouting continues)
-Seungtaek.

698
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,344
(upbeat music)

699
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,972
Sure. Go in. Bye.

700
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,226
(moans in pain)

701
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,399
(grunts)

702
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,320
(sighs)

703
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,073
-(groans in frustration)
-Seungtaek!

704
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:52,288
(upbeat tense music)

705
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,500
Come on!

706
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,794
(shouts)

707
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,298
(exclaims)

708
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,592
(screams)

709
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,974
Seeing that you're here often lately,
you must've wrapped up a campaign.

710
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:11,975
Mm-hmm.

711
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,393
Just do one thing at a time.

712
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,520
Who drinks alcohol like coffee
when they work?

713
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,565
I want to drink and don't want
to waste my weekend

714
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:19,524
but I have to work.

715
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,818
I'm trying to do everything I want to do.
What's wrong with that?

716
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,902
Oh, boy.

717
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,238
(inhales deeply)

718
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,659
PILYO: Let's go on just three dates.

719
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,828
Between you and me, that much...

720
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,083
You can do that much for me, can't you?

721
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,169
-(dramatic music)
-(keyboard clacking)

722
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,132
Do you have feelings for me?

723
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,926
MINHU: Do you have feelings for me?
Do you have feelings for me?

724
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,803
(sighs)

725
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,930
MINHU: Do you have feelings for me?

726
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,640
(gasps)

727
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,017
YESOOL: This is a sign.

728
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,852
A sign that things are getting twisted.

729
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,563
Come to your senses, Hong Yesool.

730
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,693
(exclaims)
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

731
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,111
(both laugh)

732
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,030
(slurps)

733
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,198
(both exhale)

734
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,367
Why does beer taste
so good tonight, Jiyoung?

735
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,036
Hey, Jiyoung, do you know this?

736
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,955
I can't stop thinking about her.
I keep missing her.

737
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,875
I miss her even though I see her.
I keep missing her. Again and again!

738
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,585
-(moans in frustration)
-Of course, I do!

739
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,420
You like that person so much

740
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,880
and keep thinking about her
when she's not with you.

741
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,799
(gasps)
And you go nuts worried about the person!

742
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,552
Hey. How come you and I are in sync today?

743
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,637
-(chuckles)
-Huh?

744
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,804
Hey, you know this too?

745
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,640
After staying up all night for surgery,

746
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,308
I feel like I'm going to fall over
from exhaustion.

747
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,603
But then I run over to her in the morning
to see her for five minutes and come back!

748
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,563
(sighs)
How could I not know that?

749
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,690
I missed him so much
when I was on a shoot overseas

750
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,651
so I canceled everything else
in my schedule.

751
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,862
And here I am right now...

752
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,406
right here.

753
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,909
Hey. Do you know that feeling?

754
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,869
I want to see it to the end

755
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:58,456
but she has already decided
when things will end.

756
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,166
JIYOUNG: You know that feeling?

757
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,086
He won't open up to me at all.

758
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,922
I can't even start.

759
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,299
Do you know that?

760
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,009
I'll change my passcode tonight.

761
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,344
(gasps)

762
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,638
Don't you guys dare come over
to my place again. Damn it.

763
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,600
Hey, hey. Hey, man! That jerk.

764
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,978
I've listened
to so many of your sob stories, man.

765
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,479
Yet you can't even hear me out once?

766
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,564
(moans with fatigue)

767
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,026
(sighs deeply)

768
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,488
Whoa, you're such a jerk.

769
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,407
SEUNGTAEK: Hey, pay me for therapy.

770
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,158
-(slurps)
-No money? You have it?

771
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:37,286
You don't, right?
You won't pay me even if you do, right?

772
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,788
Then I'll just sleep over tonight.

773
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,623
Don't you dare!

774
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,418
(groans)

775
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,420
(pants)
Are you okay?

776
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,963
Are you okay, Seungtaek?

777
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,298
Shit.

778
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,217
-(Jiyoung gasps)
-Huh?

779
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,763
Dr. Seungtaek has a nosebleed.

780
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,266
Perhaps you two are going to
beat up on each other and fight?

781
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,226
What?

782
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:02,603
Huh?

783
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,275
Shit. You!

784
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,819
-Come!
-(Jiyoung gasps)

785
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,030
Hey, Seungtaek.

786
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,335
Huh?

787
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,593
(smacks lips)

788
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,803
By the way, Ms. Hong.

789
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,139
What lipstick

790
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,224
do you use? Looks nice.

791
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:42,518
Huh?

792
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:43,603
(gasps)

793
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,401
MY MOM
VIDEO CALL

794
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,236
(chuckles)

795
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,365
-Mom.
-My daughter.

796
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,743
Congrats on your first project as a PM.

797
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,537
I cried watching the commercial you made.

798
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,456
I'm so proud of you.

799
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,665
Thank you.

800
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,961
By the way, you seem
to have gained some weight.

801
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,463
You must be very happy.

802
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,716
You know Chulyong is a chef.
So it's not like I can refuse his food.

803
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,177
(chuckles)
How's the wedding planning going?

804
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,970
You're coming back
after your exhibit, right?

805
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,765
How about you?
Are you seeing anyone or not?

806
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,560
Gosh, come on. Why are you always
asking me that stuff, Mom?

807
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,688
Mom, remember the commercial

808
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,398
Dad made?

809
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:33,194
I'll be making a commercial
for Mopix this time.

810
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,446
(mumbles)

811
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,491
You must miss your dad, sweetheart.

812
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,702
(clicks tongue)
Yeah, I miss him a lot lately.

813
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,248
Well, that doesn't mean
I'm not happy for your marriage.

814
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,959
SARA:
I see some liquor bottles next to you.

815
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,544
I highly recommend it.

816
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,797
Getting a little buzzed
will help you meet men.

817
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,175
(sighs)
I have a lot to tell you, Mom.

818
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,720
You have no idea how complicated
my life got because of drinks.

819
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,974
(sighs)
That's even more desirable.

820
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,477
Be a little bit tipsy at times.
And fall in love passionately too.

821
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,604
Don't be such a stickler
and work all the time.

822
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,607
Waste your life a little. Okay?

823
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,734
How could a mom say that to a daughter?

824
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:17,029
So what if you waste it a little bit?
How can you learn without wasting it?

825
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,532
That's how you meet
your true love along the way.

826
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,159
(tuts)
Never mind.

827
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,161
Have you picked out your wedding dress?

828
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,663
I have, but it's a little tight now.

829
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,415
(gasps)
What?

830
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:30,501
Ah, then you should lose some weight, Mom.

831
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,211
-MAN: Sir.
-Yes.

832
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,171
(chuckles)

833
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,591
(laughs)

834
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,259
SEUNGTAEK: Ouch. Ouch.

835
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,303
Hey, I'm going to tell my honey
about this.

836
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,847
-You're dead. Huh? Jeez.
-(moans in pain)

837
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,390
What? "You're dead"?

838
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,933
How can you speak so harshly.

839
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,060
I'm really going to tell my honey
what you did.

840
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,188
Asshole.
(whimpers)

841
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:51,772
(smacking lips)

842
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:53,816
Minhu.

843
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,612
Hong Yesool seems all right.

844
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,946
She's a good AE,

845
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:00,990
and I like her too.

846
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,700
Oh, yeah?

847
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,536
So did Hong Yesool...

848
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,872
ever come to your place?

849
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,793
Why?

850
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,796
What do you mean, why?

851
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,673
(laughs)

852
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,342
What's with your reaction?

853
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,469
"Why?" doesn't seem like
the right thing to say.

854
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,429
Why would you say, "Why?" Minhu.

855
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,223
"Why? Why?"

856
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,601
What do you mean, "Why?"
What kind of question is that?

857
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:32,230
-Huh? My baby's not picking up.
-"Why?" Whoa...

858
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,273
(Seungtaek groans)

859
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:40,947
HONEY (MY MAN FOR 7 DAYS)

860
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,618
-Do you have a lover?
-(scoffs)

861
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,662
"A lover"? You're so old school.

862
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,749
(smacking lips)
I enjoyed your movie.

863
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,501
Don't mention it.
(scoffs)

864
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,752
(slurps, smacks lips)

865
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,254
But is it okay for me
to see you like this?

866
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,798
Yesool will call me a traitor
if she finds out about this.

867
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,134
Hey, I've put a lot of work into you.
I bought you a lot of drinks too.

868
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:03,678
I pretty much raised you.
Don't you know that?

869
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,721
I even tutored you,
so you could get into college.

870
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,139
(both scoff)

871
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,557
Pilyo.

872
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,810
-Do you know what my IQ is?
-(sighs)

873
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:14,021
What tutoring?
You never came out of Yesool's room.

874
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,648
(scoffing)
My goodness.

875
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,734
(signs)
Whatever. Stop talking about the old days.

876
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:19,694
If Yesool finds out...

877
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,196
Come on. You can't do this to me.

878
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,739
Who's the traitor here?

879
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,116
Who's the traitor?

880
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,034
You helped her ghost me
for crying out loud.

881
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:30,538
Just be glad
that I'm a very understanding person.

882
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,956
I'm such a pushover.

883
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,583
I can't believe I'm begging for your help.

884
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,044
(inhales)
You know, Yesool...

885
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,630
Do you know how much she struggled
after you two broke up?

886
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:44,468
How much did she struggle?

887
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,263
Seriously, she cried every day.

888
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,474
She drank every day
and barely made it to work.

889
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,560
(sighs deeply)

890
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,937
Whenever I think about that time...
Gosh, seriously.

891
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,277
Do you think she'll still cry for me?

892
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,240
(sighs)

893
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:09,201
You don't even know
why she had to do that.

894
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,620
(inhales deeply)

895
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,082
I came back to find that out.

896
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,667
(sighs deeply)

897
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,086
I'm going to hear
her reason going forward.

898
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:24,884
(slurps)

899
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,597
SITUATION ANALYSIS
MOPIX'S PARTNERS...

900
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,270
(keyboard clacking)

901
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,405
What is it?

902
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,949
Why are you standing there
without saying anything?

903
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,577
(inhales deeply)

904
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,954
If you had told...

905
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,749
Pilyo about your secret,

906
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,918
would it have made any difference?

907
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:02,797
(somber music)

908
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,341
(sighs)

909
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,425
(inhales)

910
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:09,220
How would it have been different
had I told him?

911
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,764
(sighs deeply)

912
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:15,935
(somber music)

913
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,195
(sighs)

914
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,285
They say they want a young vibe.

915
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,414
Then their design should look young.

916
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:40,209
(sighs)
What do they want us to do...

917
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,460
(groans)

918
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,256
What if you barely show the design

919
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,759
and emphasize the fact
that it's comfortable to wear?

920
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,928
-Make it look sexy and young.
-Goodness.

921
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,639
-(moans in pain)
-That's pretty good.

922
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,516
Learn from her, you guys.

923
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,226
(laughs)

924
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,104
Gosh, I always appreciate your feedback.

925
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,315
Minhee, can you join our team?

926
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,693
(laughs awkwardly)
That's too...

927
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,487
(chuckles)
"That's too..."

928
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:12,366
Minhee, Ms. Hong is only
a few years older than you, right?

929
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,534
Yes.

930
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,203
People like you should grow
by leaps and bounds.

931
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,583
You haven't been able to advance
because Cha Minhu only favors Yesool.

932
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,835
It looks like it's been decided
that Yesool will be the PM

933
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,504
on the Mopix project too.

934
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:28,466
(sighs deeply)

935
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,842
Think about it.

936
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:33,012
Considering her experience and her rank,

937
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,724
how could Hong Yesool
be the PM every time?

938
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,226
-(banging on table)
-How? Every time?

939
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,145
(sighs)

940
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,856
That's why you need connections.

941
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,734
You guys too.
If not, you'll end up like me.

942
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,823
It looks like you
especially despise Ms. Hong.

943
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,618
That's because she abandoned me.

944
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,244
Excuse me?

945
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,205
She left running
when Cha Minhu called for her.

946
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,957
I really adored her.

947
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,709
(whispers)
What do you mean?

948
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,628
(sighs)
Never mind that.

949
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,423
From what I saw at the party,

950
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,260
I think something's up
between Lee Pilyo and Hong Yesool.

951
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,678
Do you know anything?

952
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,181
I don't know either.

953
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:21,268
I just know they took the new car
for a test drive today.

954
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,604
-That's all I know.
-Just the two of them?

955
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,606
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

956
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,359
Here you go.
(exhales deeply)

957
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,111
I even had to see our legal team
to get approval for this.

958
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,364
We'll be in huge trouble
if anything goes wrong.

959
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,324
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

960
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,869
I UNDERSTAND THE STATEMENT ABOVE
AND THEREFORE SIGN HERE

961
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:39,912
(sighs)

962
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,379
Okay.
(grunts)

963
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,928
Shall we go?

964
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:58,681
(sighs)

965
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:10,401
MOPIX independently developed
Dynamic Damper Control for this new model.

966
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:14,071
This car operates in different modes.
Comfort mode for city driving,

967
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,448
off-road mode for off-road driving,
and sports mode on highways.

968
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,577
Oh, then we should test
how it operates in those modes.

969
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,620
As I said the other day,

970
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,248
maintaining confidentiality
is paramount for this project.

971
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,165
(sighs)

972
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,625
Please do not remove the cover

973
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:29,128
or take pictures
with an unsecured phone...

974
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,254
Please get in the car.

975
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,927
(sighs)

976
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,725
(exhales)
Just sit in the front.

977
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,894
I'm sorry. I get terrible car sickness.

978
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:48,439
I get carsick if I sit in the front seat.

979
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:49,898
PILYO'S PLAYLIST

980
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,692
You used to like this singer's songs.

981
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,652
No, I only listen to pansori.

982
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,615
You used to like this chocolate a lot.

983
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,533
I went to the store
near our school to buy it.

984
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,161
No. I don't eat chocolates.

985
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,581
But wait, are we going on a picnic
or something?

986
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,542
Boy, we didn't have anything back then
and couldn't afford a car.

987
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,544
So all we did was walk
around holding hands.

988
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,212
(snorts)

989
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,470
I think I'll have to drive.

990
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,889
The confidentiality policy
is very strict this time.

991
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,683
My job is to prevent anything unexpected
from happening.

992
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:30,564
Since you're so creative and adventurous,
I'll have to support you as a manager.

993
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,108
(sighs)

994
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,320
(upbeat music)

995
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,124
(clears throat)

996
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,547
(Minhu clears throat)

997
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,678
Ms. Hong. How is your car sickness?

998
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,974
You drive quite aggressively.

999
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:10,229
I think I should drive myself
to get some great ideas.

1000
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,940
I haven't gotten into a car accident
in the last 10 years.

1001
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,362
Where are you going?

1002
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,782
As you know, I'm creative and adventurous.

1003
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,077
You'll see when we get there.

1004
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:26,995
(sighs)

1005
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,749
(upbeat music)

1006
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,360
(tires screech)

1007
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,926
(tires screech)

1008
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,853
(music fades)

1009
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,401
(wind blowing)

1010
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,487
(pensive music)

1011
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,365
This is it.

1012
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,744
I saw this.

1013
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,497
You and me...

1014
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:54,416
Are we in another country? Is it a desert?

1015
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,793
I don't know where we are.

1016
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,047
Is it dust or sand?

1017
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,758
You see the dust?

1018
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,344
It's exactly how I described it.

1019
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,846
I told you
I saw us standing here like this.

1020
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,224
It's exactly what I had said.

1021
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,604
(cell phone vibrates)

1022
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:18,899
Yes.

1023
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,693
Just a moment, please.

1024
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:23,403
Unbelievable.

1025
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,037
What's he doing?

1026
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,166
What do you think you're doing?

1027
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,502
I told you, you can't do this!

1028
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,547
Come on, just 10 shots. No one comes here.
They won't get leaked.

1029
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:42,839
How can you be so sure?

1030
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:46,176
If the new design leaks out,
all hell will break loose.

1031
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:47,886
(chuckles)

1032
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:49,930
-(gasps)
-(camera shutter clicks)

1033
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,767
(sighs)

1034
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,394
What are you doing?

1035
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,187
I just came up with an idea.

1036
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,398
(sighs)

1037
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,027
(camera shutter clicks)

1038
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,822
(light music)

1039
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,051
(in English)
Okay, you guys are perfect.

1040
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:30,429
Scene 1, take 5, let's roll!

1041
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,307
You look so cool.

1042
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,685
(light music)

1043
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:46,820
Cool, huh?

1044
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,031
Yeah, cool.

1045
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:58,790
This is how cool the new model V9
from Mopix is.

1046
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,668
It drives very dynamically and is sporty.

1047
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,630
With a sexy design emphasizing
the lower part of the car,

1048
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:08,550
its locking differential
and ELSD are fabulous,

1049
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:11,261
-and goes from 0 to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds.
-(scoffs)

1050
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:14,973
So please make sure to highlight
these great functions and design.

1051
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,559
Yes, Ms. Hong.

1052
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,902
I'll make sure to do it perfectly.

1053
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:28,904
Hi, Dr. Oh.

1054
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,405
I'm fine now.

1055
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:31,865
I'm not showing any symptoms.

1056
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,660
I'll tell you the details when I see you.

1057
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,287
I want to ask you something
about that day too.

1058
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:40,290
PILYO: Be careful.

1059
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,001
-Bye.
-(phone beeps)

1060
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,301
PILYO: When will you keep your promise,
by the way?

1061
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:54,346
You said you'd accept...

1062
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:56,890
my proposal if I win the award.

1063
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,725
Don't you remember?

1064
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:02,896
PALME D'OR, HOLLYWOOD!
I'LL ACHIEVE ALL OF THEM!

1065
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:07,776
Propose to me if you win the award.

1066
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,611
With a ring.

1067
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:10,904
Do you really mean that?

1068
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,699
-Then I'm really going to win the award.
-Sure, win it.

1069
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:16,702
-I'll get one from Hollywood.
-Sure, I said go ahead.

1070
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:19,579
-(screams)
-I'm going to go to Cannes!

1071
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:20,580
Go!

1072
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,290
Wait for me, Cannes!
(laughs)

1073
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:23,667
YESOOL: Let's go!

1074
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:26,211
(light music)

1075
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,258
I always carry the ring with me.

1076
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,511
Why are you doing this?

1077
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,722
Did you forget how we broke up?

1078
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,181
Yeah.

1079
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:39,933
I forgot.

1080
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,270
I only thought about
how we can get back together.

1081
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:49,151
The thought of coming to get you.

1082
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,528
And the thought
of never making you cry again.

1083
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,655
That's what kept me going.

1084
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,203
So I'm back...

1085
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,248
not just to date you.

1086
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:05,834
I'm here to marry you.

1087
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,546
What a crazy nut.

1088
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:11,798
(soft chuckle)
So I'm saying...

1089
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,302
just go on three dates
with this crazy nut.

1090
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,723
PILYO: As for this...

1091
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,810
I plan to carry it with me
until you accept my proposal.

1092
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:29,733
(gasps)

1093
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,572
(Yesool groans)

1094
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,158
Are you okay, Yesool?

1095
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,209
(mellow music)

1096
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,732
The car got dirty, but there is no damage.

1097
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:11,691
Okay.

1098
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:13,485
-Should I sign here?
-Yes.

1099
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,278
CONFIRMATION

1100
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,115
-Here's the key.
-Okay.

1101
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,077
(sighs)

1102
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,496
Let's go eat.
I made a reservation at a restaurant.

1103
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,206
You've been wanting to go there.

1104
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,582
Excuse me, Director Lee Pilyo.

1105
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,459
We broke up three years ago.

1106
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:33,255
I'm not the same Hong Yesool who used
to pester you, wanting to go places.

1107
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,090
Right now, I'm...

1108
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:38,134
You're still the same Hong Yesool,
from back then and even now.

1109
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,302
Am I wrong?

1110
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,054
(sighs)

1111
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:45,267
Hong Yesool will go with me
in order to pull her proposal together.

1112
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,351
All right then.

1113
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,061
Let's go.

1114
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,942
(sighs)

1115
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:01,658
(sighs deeply)

1116
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,085
(light music)

1117
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,220
(gasps)

1118
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:28,768
(Yesool groans)

1119
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,738
(pensive music)

1120
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:49,998
I trip over something, and you hold me.

1121
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,751
And because of that, your cellphone screen

1122
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,252
cracks.

1123
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,421
(sighs)

1124
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,298
(exhales deeply)

1125
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,121
-Hong Yesool.
-Mr. Cha.

1126
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:32,540
(sighs softly)

1127
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,836
I think I should hear about that day.

1128
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,255
What you saw...

1129
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:40,966
I believe you now.

1130
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:44,636
Our future that you saw.

1131
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,055
So, tell me.

1132
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,766
(gentle music)

1133
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,814
We kiss each other...

1134
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,483
and go into your apartment.

1135
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:05,281
I mean, in your bedroom, we will...

1136
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:09,411
Your bed sheets, the walls,
your comforter in your bedroom.

1137
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,872
I even remember the lamp
stand next to your bed clearly.

1138
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:17,585
You saw that all the future events
that I saw came to be, right?

1139
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,338
We'll keep getting involved like that.

1140
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,134
Of course, you don't like
getting involved with me.

1141
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,969
-So...
-I never said I don't like it.

1142
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:31,057
Come on, don't play around.

1143
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,309
I really feel like I'm dying.

1144
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,271
I really like our company

1145
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:39,399
and want to focus on work without
any personal feelings getting in the way.

1146
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:43,570
At this rate, never mind work.
I don't think I can do anything.

1147
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,573
-So let's just...
-All right.

1148
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,576
(sighs)
Let's do it.

1149
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:51,870
Pardon?

1150
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:53,788
Let's do it.

1151
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,504
YESOOL: I've thought of this before.

1152
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,673
Tonight is good.

1153
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,928
"Was this bound to happen?

1154
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,639
Or did I make it happen?"

1155
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,935
But I have one condition.

1156
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,147
(gentle music)

1157
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,036
(gentle music continues)
