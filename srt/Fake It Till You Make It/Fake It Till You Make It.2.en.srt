00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,686
He has a bachelor's and master's degree from Tsinghua.

184
00:12:57,686 --> 00:12:59,926
A stable job.

185
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:01,207
He's tall.

186
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:03,166
He looks okay...

187
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,427
and his family background is not bad.

188
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:08,206
Okay, let me stop you there.

189
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,027
Listen to yourself.

190
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:13,087
He's not applying for a job.

191
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,207
You're making it sound like

192
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,666
the conditions for applying to a company.

193
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,566
Just ask yourself.

194
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:21,326
What touched you the most about him?

195
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:26,376
Honesty.

196
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:30,267
That's it?

197
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,486
Originally, dating should be

198
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:36,027
with the purpose of marriage.

199
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,547
But marriage

200
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:41,526
is long and boring.

201
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:43,026
I feel that even if you find someone

202
00:13:43,026 --> 00:13:44,566
who is interesting,

203
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:45,847
in the end,

204
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:48,766
they will become dull.

205
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:51,767
It's better to find someone who is straightforward,

206
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,947
kind to you,

207
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:56,526
and honest.

208
00:13:56,526 --> 00:13:58,507
I think that's the best.

209
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:15,800
♫ I saw your light was fading ♫

210
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:25,010
♫ I saw that you were falling down ♫

211
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:38,660
♫ We've been holding on 'cause something about the way we love is true ♫

212
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:45,570
♫ And we're fighting for ♫

213
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,200
♫ Fighting for... ♫

214
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:58,928
Xinzi.

215
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,656
Sis.

216
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:14,400
♫ Because when you take it all away, you're in love with all the pain ♫

217
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:16,227
I got it.

218
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:21,147
I've really realized it.

219
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:22,886
Sweet love will never happen for me.

220
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:25,227
Sweet love will never happen for me.

221
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:29,587
I'm just like the second female lead in the TV drama.

222
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:31,786
I'm just like the second female lead in the TV drama.

223
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:35,766
I'm neither understanding

224
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:37,987
nor gentle.

225
00:15:40,746 --> 00:15:44,127
I won't find happiness.

226
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,806
Heaven is punishing me.

227
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:57,504
Xinzi,

228
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:00,087
a breakup

229
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:02,486
is like catching a severe cold.

230
00:16:02,486 --> 00:16:06,086
When the time comes, you will naturally feel better.

231
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,406
In this world,

232
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:10,867
there is no man worth giving up yourself for.

233
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:13,026
there is no man worth giving up yourself for.

234
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:17,427
Starting tomorrow, go for a run in the park across the street. Okay?

235
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:19,127
I can't run.

236
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:20,827
All right then.

237
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:22,467
If you don't run tomorrow,

238
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:23,827
and I come back to see you still lying on this couch like this,

239
00:16:23,827 --> 00:16:25,167
and I come back to see you still lying on this couch like this,

240
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,516
and I come back to see you still lying on this couch like this,

241
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:28,107
I'll immediately call your mom.

242
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:30,627
How can you be so ruthless, Sis?

243
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:32,367
Cheer up, my little sister.

244
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,888
Cheer up, my little sister.

245
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,027
You're too naive.

246
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:47,417
I really have to thank you this time.

247
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:49,037
Lang Wen told me everything.

248
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:50,626
The reason this painting was found and shipped from Hong Kong so quickly is all thanks to you.

249
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:51,827
The reason this painting was found and shipped from Hong Kong so quickly is all thanks to you.

250
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:54,007
The reason this painting was found and shipped from Hong Kong so quickly is all thanks to you.

251
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:55,127
The reason this painting was found and shipped from Hong Kong so quickly is all thanks to you.

252
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:57,597
No, no, don't say that.

253
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,467
I just happened to havea friend who's a curator,

254
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,687
and I asked for a favor.

255
00:17:02,907 --> 00:17:05,226
Is Auntie planning on using it as a gift?

256
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:08,626
Tell me about it. My mom comes up with all sorts of ideas.

257
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:10,126
Tell me about it. My mom comes up with all sorts of ideas.

258
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:11,587
And then when she gets busy, she calls me for errands.

259
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:13,126
And then when she gets busy, she calls me for errands.

260
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:14,687
Even though it's her gift,

261
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:16,766
she had to let me find it.

262
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,607
Is Auntie

263
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,747
also in our line of work?

264
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:24,147
Yes, my mom works at Jinrui.

265
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:28,447
Although my mom wanted me to work in investment banking,

266
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,747
I really don't like the atmosphere there.

267
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,327
I really don't like the atmosphere there.

268
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:33,267
Interpersonal relationships are too complicated.

269
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:35,027
Everyone is wearing a mask,

270
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:38,147
and you can't tell who's real and who's fake.

271
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:40,546
But you're different from them.

272
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:41,796
What's different about me?

273
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:45,727
You're kinder than them.

274
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:50,247
We've only met twice,

275
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:51,687
and you think I'm very kind?

276
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,257
I'm good at judging people.

277
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:54,327
My mom always takes me to socialize with various people from the business.

278
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:56,487
My mom always takes me to socialize with various people from the business.

279
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:58,827
None of them are like you.

280
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:02,307
You're also very different.

281
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:06,827
Are you at Xintai now?

282
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:08,352
Yes.

283
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:11,787
My mom has a best friend at Xintai,

284
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:14,846
and she even introduced a project to my mom before.

285
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:23,027
Xinzi? Xinzi.

286
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,227
Sis, I'm going for a run.

287
00:18:33,227 --> 00:18:37,007
You were right. Starting today, I'm going to find myself.

288
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:39,086
Thank you for your encouragement.

289
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:48,926
- Miss Wang.
- Come in.

290
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,700
Go ahead.

291
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:59,827
About the competition, the score sheet and the recommendation letter,

292
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:02,587
today is the deadline.

293
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:09,320
I see.

294
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:22,407
Tang Ying,

295
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:24,806
when you really

296
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:26,587
when you really went to work with someone else,

297
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:28,307
you will realize that I'm still the best to you.

298
00:19:28,307 --> 00:19:30,546
you will realize that I'm still the best to you.

299
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,447
Because I'm on your side.

300
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:37,006
Sometimes I'm a bit strict with you, but it's for your own good.

301
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:39,766
The recommendation letter and the score sheet,

302
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:41,988
I've already submitted them.

303
00:19:46,872 --> 00:19:48,244
Go get busy.

304
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:49,707
Okay.

305
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:54,027
Okay, come on! We're doing throws.

306
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:58,247
Backward, forward. Okay, again.

307
00:19:58,827 --> 00:20:00,107
Forward. Come on, once again.

308
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:03,986
Backward, forward. One last time.

309
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,827
Okay, that's it for today. Class dismissed.

310
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:14,306
- Thank you, Coach.
- You're welcome.

311
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:18,067
How was it? Isn't this more interesting

312
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:20,006
than just lifting weights?

313
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,566
This barbell

314
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:26,417
seems to be training your body

315
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:27,777
when actually,

316
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:30,567
it's training your mindset.

317
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:32,497
If there's even a hint of distraction,

318
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,787
this big stick might just end up on your forehead.

319
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:35,887
this big stick might just end up on your forehead.

320
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:38,366
Do you know why I appreciate you?

321
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:43,307
Look at you. You're competent at work and handle things well.

322
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:45,066
Look at you. You're competent at work and handle things well.

323
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:49,147
No matter how tired, you always stay focused.

324
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:51,827
It's rare to find someone who can balance life and work.

325
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:53,767
It's rare to find someone who can balance life and work.

326
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:58,626
But, Richard,

327
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,806
I'm still a bit worried

328
00:21:00,806 --> 00:21:03,066
about the Green Energy case.

329
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,172
Speak.

330
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:31,796
Mr. Fang from Green Energy actually wants the company to go public.

331
00:21:31,796 --> 00:21:33,797
Mr. Fang from Green Energy actually wants the company to go public.

332
00:21:33,797 --> 00:21:35,946
That's why he kicked his father-in-law out

333
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:38,226
and why he rejected us.

334
00:21:38,226 --> 00:21:39,907
But as far as I know,

335
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:42,466
the father-in-law has contacted other investment banks.

336
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:44,546
I've also reached out, trying to compete.

337
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:46,447
But there was no response.

338
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,447
Elvis.

339
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:56,586
I brought you here to solve problems.

340
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:06,586
The capital environment is not good now.

341
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:09,906
If we miss out on Wanguo because we lost Green Energy—

342
00:22:09,906 --> 00:22:11,616
Richard.

343
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,147
I understand.

344
00:22:16,147 --> 00:22:18,407
Don't worry. I'll do my best

345
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:19,747
to win over Walrus and Green Energy, at least one of them.

346
00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:21,227
to win over Walrus and Green Energy, at least one of them.

347
00:22:21,227 --> 00:22:23,547
Not just for myself,

348
00:22:23,547 --> 00:22:27,186
but also for my subordinates, so that they won't be laid off.

349
00:22:29,107 --> 00:22:31,166
You can make the judgment.

350
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:34,444
Okay.

351
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:51,707
Hello, Mu.

352
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,967
- Sis.
- Xinzi.

353
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:59,846
Are you making a PowerPoint?

354
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,366
I didn't know you were doing this.

355
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:03,927
Didn't you tell me?

356
00:23:03,927 --> 00:23:05,626
That I can't give up on myself for someone who's not worth it.

357
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:06,787
That I can't give up on myself for someone who's not worth it.

358
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:09,206
So, I plan to start a selection mode.

359
00:23:09,206 --> 00:23:10,466
What are you selecting?

360
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,846
Men, of course.

361

00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:15,487
The flashy coat that Wang wore yesterday,

716
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:17,626
The flashy coat that Wang wore yesterday,

717
00:46:17,626 --> 00:46:18,927
it's a fake.

718
00:46:18,927 --> 00:46:20,156
Wang told us she bought it at the counter.

719
00:46:20,156 --> 00:46:21,437
Wang told us she bought it at the counter.

720
00:46:21,437 --> 00:46:23,847
And it would cost us several months' salary.

721
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,326
She can only deceive you girls who don't have sharp eyes.

722
00:46:25,326 --> 00:46:26,817
She can only deceive you girls who don't have sharp eyes.

723
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,407
I saw from a distance that the material was off.

724
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:29,877
I saw from a distance that the material was off.

725
00:46:29,877 --> 00:46:31,867
Then I accidentally saw that the collar label was cut off.

726
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:33,666
Then I accidentally saw that the collar label was cut off.

727
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,527
Then it must be fake.

728
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:37,427
- Your immediate superior is a Taiwanese. Right?
- Yes.

729
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,607
- Your immediate superior is a Taiwanese. Right?
- Yes.

730
00:46:39,607 --> 00:46:41,607
This MD...

731
00:46:42,626 --> 00:46:44,607
doesn't seem very prominent.

732
00:46:44,987 --> 00:46:46,947
Cutting the collar label means it's fake?

733
00:46:46,947 --> 00:46:48,187
Or what?

734
00:46:48,187 --> 00:46:49,766
A few thousand dollars worth of clothes selling for a few hundred dollars,

735
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:50,937
A few thousand dollars worth of clothes selling for a few hundred dollars,

736
00:46:50,937 --> 00:46:52,377
where's the threshold?

737
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:54,906
If anyone can afford it,

738
00:46:54,906 --> 00:46:57,926
what's the brand value?

739
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:02,747
Richard came back from Wall Street,

740
00:47:02,747 --> 00:47:05,026
so his methods are a bit Western.

741
00:47:05,026 --> 00:47:07,146
But rest assured,

742
00:47:07,146 --> 00:47:08,817
as subordinates,

743
00:47:08,817 --> 00:47:11,126
we are very rigorous in our work.

744
00:47:16,226 --> 00:47:18,026
This is it.

745
00:47:21,187 --> 00:47:23,726
Coming.

746
00:47:31,047 --> 00:47:33,707
- Meiling.
- Dear.

747
00:47:34,626 --> 00:47:36,687
Welcome, come on.

748
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:41,007
You're dressed so grandly today.

749
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:42,587
Tang, you should watch and learn.

750
00:47:42,587 --> 00:47:45,467
Sometimes, life needs a sense of ceremony.

751
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:47,187
Of course.

752
00:47:47,187 --> 00:47:49,397
I'm about to finish the last dish.

753
00:47:49,397 --> 00:47:51,987
No need to change shoes. Make yourself at home.

754
00:47:51,987 --> 00:47:53,047
Feel free to look around.

755
00:47:53,047 --> 00:47:54,688
Okay.

756
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:04,486
Your home is really stylish.

757
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:11,907
So exquisite.

758
00:48:11,907 --> 00:48:13,512
All right.

759
00:48:14,888 --> 00:48:16,447
[Wang's Family Feast]

760
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:19,526
She seems to like Wen Zhengming.

761
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:23,307
Beginners are always like this.

762
00:48:26,226 --> 00:48:27,746
Such precious ingredients.

763
00:48:27,746 --> 00:48:30,466
You've spent a lot today.

764
00:48:31,146 --> 00:48:32,647
What's so precious?

765
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:34,146
It's just something from a friend who cooks,

766
00:48:34,146 --> 00:48:36,367
It's just something from a friend who cooks,

767
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:38,466
and I didn't even ask for the price.

768
00:48:39,526 --> 00:48:40,947
Then it must be from a very good friend.

769
00:48:40,947 --> 00:48:43,087
Then it must be from a very good friend.

770
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,987
For such things, the price difference is huge

771
00:48:45,987 --> 00:48:49,587
between wild and farmed ones.

772
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,027
Really?

773
00:48:53,947 --> 00:48:55,626
I've only eaten the wild ones.

774
00:48:55,626 --> 00:48:58,666
I don't know what the farmed ones taste like.

775
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:00,546
Why don't you help me taste it?

776
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:01,547
Me too.

777
00:49:01,547 --> 00:49:02,607
Modest.

778
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:05,186
You can definitely taste the difference.

779
00:49:10,586 --> 00:49:12,160
How is it?

780
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,736
A dozen raw oysters,

781
00:49:20,687 --> 00:49:23,267
two portions of charcoal-grilled steak.

782
00:49:25,747 --> 00:49:29,126
Ms. Xin, what about the dessert?

783
00:49:29,126 --> 00:49:30,277
You can decide.

784
00:49:30,277 --> 00:49:31,586
All right.

785
00:49:31,586 --> 00:49:33,516
Cheese mousse.

786
00:49:34,126 --> 00:49:35,424
Come on.

787
00:49:37,527 --> 00:49:38,726
Mr. Xu, we have a new Bolognese pasta here. Would you like to try it?

788
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,926
Mr. Xu, we have a new Bolognese pasta here. Would you like to try it?

789
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:44,327
Next time.

790
00:49:44,327 --> 00:49:47,606
Ms. Xin, I know you're allergic to gluten. Right?

791
00:49:47,606 --> 00:49:49,447
I didn't expect you

792
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:50,607
to know me so well.

793
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:52,566
to know me so well.

794
00:49:52,566 --> 00:49:55,226
I did a little bit of research.

795
00:49:57,507 --> 00:49:59,466
Try this spaghetti.

796
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:02,307
My signature dish, come on.

797
00:50:12,027 --> 00:50:12,907
It's delicious.

798
00:50:12,907 --> 00:50:14,632
Isn't it?

799
00:50:16,387 --> 00:50:17,746
Compared to the authentic one

800
00:50:17,746 --> 00:50:19,377
I had in Spain,

801
00:50:19,377 --> 00:50:20,387
there's still a little room for improvement,

802
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:22,487
there's still a little room for improvement,

803
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,467
but it's already very good.

804
00:50:25,346 --> 00:50:26,927
Where do you think there's room for improvement?

805
00:50:26,927 --> 00:50:29,147
Where do you think there's room for improvement?

806
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:32,827
The noodles seem to be a bit hard.

807
00:50:32,827 --> 00:50:34,776
Are they?

808
00:50:42,947 --> 00:50:46,227
This is how authentic Italian spaghetti is made.

809
00:50:46,227 --> 00:50:49,026
The texture is perfect.

810
00:50:49,026 --> 00:50:50,327
You try it, too

811
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:51,746
Dear, did you forget to add salt when you were cooking the spaghetti?

812
00:50:51,746 --> 00:50:54,107
Dear, did you forget to add salt when you were cooking the spaghetti?

813
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:57,046
I remember now.

814
00:50:57,046 --> 00:50:59,927
I used Himalayan rose salt,

815
00:50:59,927 --> 00:51:01,347
and most people might not taste the flavor.

816
00:51:01,347 --> 00:51:03,327
and most people might not taste the flavor.

817
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:04,807
If you think it's bland,

818
00:51:04,807 --> 00:51:05,907
I can get you some regular salt.

819
00:51:05,907 --> 00:51:08,206
I have low sodium iodized salt here.

820
00:51:08,206 --> 00:51:10,387
I got it! Last night,

821
00:51:10,387 --> 00:51:11,427
I had French imported oysters with my husband,

822
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:12,786
I had French imported oysters with my husband,

823
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:14,807
and it must have affected my taste buds.

824
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:16,507
- You can't eat too much of it.
- Thank you, dear.

825
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:18,706
What a feast, cheers.

826
00:51:18,706 --> 00:51:21,726
It's my pleasure, cheers.

827
00:51:24,407 --> 00:51:25,846
Mr. Xu, this bottle of wine has been decanted for three hours.

828
00:51:25,846 --> 00:51:27,686
Mr. Xu, this bottle of wine has been decanted for three hours.

829
00:51:27,686 --> 00:51:30,227
Ms. Xin, I forgot to tell you.

830
00:51:30,227 --> 00:51:32,637
I know you like to collect wine,

831
00:51:32,637 --> 00:51:34,467
so I asked a friend to find a bottle of decent old wine.

832
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,206
so I asked a friend to find a bottle of decent old wine.

833
00:51:37,026 --> 00:51:40,206
However, old wine has a chance of oxidation.

834
00:51:40,206 --> 00:51:41,567
I don't know what kind of surprise

835
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:42,607
this bottle of wine will bring to us.

836
00:51:42,607 --> 00:51:44,867
this bottle of wine will bring to us.

837
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:48,526
Ms. Xin, you're the expert. You can try it.

838
00:51:48,526 --> 00:51:50,626
Stop calling me Ms. Xin.

839
00:51:50,626 --> 00:51:53,066
It makes me sound old.

840
00:51:53,066 --> 00:51:56,207
Call me sister.

841
00:52:02,867 --> 00:52:05,147
The aroma is very rich.

842
00:52:15,067 --> 00:52:17,726
Time has made the wine's flavor

843
00:52:17,726 --> 00:52:19,546
more layered.

844
00:52:19,546 --> 00:52:21,187
The fruitiness is bright,

845
00:52:21,187 --> 00:52:23,687
and the tannins are delicate.

846
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:27,926
Overall, the wine performs well.

847
00:52:30,187 --> 00:52:31,787
It seems

848
00:52:31,787 --> 00:52:33,767
we're very lucky today.

849
00:52:34,347 --> 00:52:35,706
Pour the wine, please.

850
00:52:35,706 --> 00:52:38,027
Next is the most important part of Wang's Family Feast.

851
00:52:38,027 --> 00:52:40,287
Next is the most important part of Wang's Family Feast.

852
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:45,126
Welcome to my cinema salon.

853
00:52:45,126 --> 00:52:46,427
When I'm at home, I watch movies whenever I'm not busy.

854
00:52:46,427 --> 00:52:49,466
When I'm at home, I watch movies whenever I'm not busy.

855
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,506
I especially like

856
00:52:51,506 --> 00:52:54,646
French New Wave films.

857
00:52:54,646 --> 00:52:57,586
They're unique, like

858
00:52:57,586 --> 00:52:58,867
Les Quatre cents coups.

859
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:01,146
A bout de souffle.

860
00:53:01,146 --> 00:53:03,567
They're so classic. I never get tired of them.

861
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:07,246
Miss Wang, you've collected so many philosophy books.

862
00:53:07,246 --> 00:53:08,337
You must have your own insights into philosophy.

863
00:53:08,337 --> 00:53:10,727
You must have your own insights into philosophy.

864
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:17,667
I'm just browsing, but I know a thing or two.

865
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:19,067
I believe

866
00:53:19,067 --> 00:53:21,246
the rationality of Western philosophy is achieved through dialectics.

867
00:53:21,246 --> 00:53:23,506
the rationality of Western philosophy is achieved through dialectics.

868
00:53:23,506 --> 00:53:26,106
Compared to Western philosophy, Eastern philosophy is more...

869
00:53:26,106 --> 00:53:28,106
Compared to Western philosophy, Eastern philosophy is more...

870
00:53:28,106 --> 00:53:31,667
how can I say, it's more...

871
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:34,637
accurate, yes.

872
00:53:34,637 --> 00:53:36,487
More accurate.

873
00:53:37,226 --> 00:53:38,867
Philosophy cannot be distinguished by East and West.

874
00:53:38,867 --> 00:53:41,107
Philosophy cannot be distinguished by East and West.

875
00:53:41,107 --> 00:53:44,947
Philosophy is the philosophy of all mankind,

876
00:53:44,947 --> 00:53:47,806
not the philosophy of philosophers.

877
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:50,787
What do you think, Tang?

878
00:53:50,787 --> 00:53:53,106
Yeah, what do you think?

879
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:55,726
I wouldn't know. I'm not familiar.

880
00:53:55,726 --> 00:53:58,347
Why don't we watch a movie?

881
00:53:58,347 --> 00:54:01,006
Okay, let's watch a movie.

882
00:54:06,947 --> 00:54:10,287
Ziquan, in fact,

883
00:54:10,287 --> 00:54:12,847
apart from Green Energy that you've already negotiated with,

884
00:54:12,847 --> 00:54:15,587
Wanguo is also interested in acquiring Walrus Technology,

885
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:18,886
and a newly emerged Aroma.

886
00:54:20,086 --> 00:54:22,046
That is...

887
00:54:22,046 --> 00:54:24,267
all the hints I can give you now.

888
00:54:24,267 --> 00:54:25,967
My dear sister,

889
00:54:25,967 --> 00:54:27,507
the information you gave me is very important.

890
00:54:27,507 --> 00:54:29,166
the information you gave me is very important.

891
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:32,047
Sister, rest assured.

892
00:54:32,047 --> 00:54:34,626
I will not let you down.

893
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:37,187
The MD of the other group is called Ada.

894
00:55:37,187 --> 00:55:38,786
Right.

895
00:55:38,786 --> 00:55:40,906
She also asked me out.

896
00:55:41,646 --> 00:55:43,347
Do you want to know what she said?

897
00:55:43,347 --> 00:55:45,666
Do you want to know what she said?

898
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:58,107
What she said,

899
00:56:00,046 --> 00:56:01,926
I can remember...

900
00:56:03,367 --> 00:56:05,287
or I can forget.

901
00:56:17,027 --> 00:56:20,026
[Xu Ziquan]

902
00:56:20,026 --> 00:56:21,926
Help.

903
00:56:25,226 --> 00:56:27,057
Miss Wang. Mrs. Meiling.

904
00:56:27,057 --> 00:56:28,326
I have a friend who asked for my help in a hurry.

905
00:56:28,326 --> 00:56:30,037
I have a friend who asked for my help in a hurry.

906
00:56:30,037 --> 00:56:31,127
A very good friend.

907
00:56:31,127 --> 00:56:33,047
I don't understand this movie anyway.

908
00:56:33,047 --> 00:56:35,327
Can I leave early?

909
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,587
It's okay, you go ahead.

910
00:56:37,587 --> 00:56:39,987
Okay, you can teach me again next time.

911
00:56:39,987 --> 00:56:41,727
You guys take your time.

912
00:56:51,226 --> 00:56:53,566
All right, enough about work.

913
00:56:53,566 --> 00:56:55,066
It's so boring,

914
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:56,686
Tell me about you.

915
00:56:56,686 --> 00:56:58,817
Tell me all about you.

916
00:56:58,817 --> 00:57:00,787
Me?

917
00:57:00,787 --> 00:57:02,887
I grew up in…

918
00:57:04,746 --> 00:57:07,446
Sorry, it's my boss.

919
00:57:09,424 --> 00:57:10,806
Hello?

920
00:57:11,626 --> 00:57:16,346
I... I'm meeting with a very important person.

921
00:57:16,346 --> 00:57:18,587
I... I'm meeting with a very important person.

922
00:57:21,686 --> 00:57:25,046
Now? But I…

923
00:57:33,226 --> 00:57:35,437
Sister Xin, I'm really sorry.

924
00:57:35,437 --> 00:57:36,507
There's a case in the company that urgently needs me.

925
00:57:36,507 --> 00:57:38,367
There's a case in the company that urgently needs me.

926
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:41,506
Ziquan, go ahead. It's okay.

927
00:57:41,506 --> 00:57:43,407
We have all the time in the world.

928
00:57:43,407 --> 00:57:46,267
Let's reschedule... and chat more.

929
00:57:46,267 --> 00:57:47,467
Let's reschedule... and chat more.

930
00:57:47,827 --> 00:57:49,777
Okay, another day.

931
00:57:49,777 --> 00:57:51,087
I'll ask Sister Xin out again.

932
00:57:51,087 --> 00:57:52,317
Let's talk more.

933
00:57:52,317 --> 00:57:54,196
Deal.

934
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:19,307
The first time you ask me out is at a hotel.

935
00:58:30,227 --> 00:58:32,112
I want this.

936
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:36,686
What's wrong?

937
00:58:36,686 --> 00:58:37,786
Your life isn't worth a luxurious afternoon tea set?

938
00:58:37,786 --> 00:58:40,626
Your life isn't worth a luxurious afternoon tea set?

939
00:58:41,106 --> 00:58:42,848
Waiter.

940
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,286
- Hello.
- 1,288.

941
00:58:45,286 --> 00:58:46,496
- Okay.
- Thank you.

942
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:49,507
Whatever you say.

943
00:58:55,987 --> 00:58:57,488
Enjoy your meal.

944
00:58:58,226 --> 00:59:00,526
These are all for you.

945
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:03,000
Thank you very much.

946
00:59:04,867 --> 00:59:07,867
You must have asked out a girl you shouldn't have,

947
00:59:07,867 --> 00:59:11,537
and then you needed a way out. Right?

948
00:59:11,537 --> 00:59:13,446
It wasn't a girl.

949
00:59:13,446 --> 00:59:15,606
It was a big sister.

950
00:59:15,606 --> 00:59:17,677
And she hooked my leg with her foot,

951
00:59:17,677 --> 00:59:19,686
I didn't know why.

952
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:21,027
It made me a little scared.

953
00:59:21,027 --> 00:59:23,646
She hooked your leg?

954
00:59:27,707 --> 00:59:30,026
Then, why did you send me a message?

955
00:59:30,026 --> 00:59:31,406
Are we close?

956
00:59:31,406 --> 00:59:33,347
Who said I only sent a message to you?

957
00:59:33,347 --> 00:59:34,747
It was mass texting.

958
00:59:34,747 --> 00:59:37,026
But only you replied.

959
00:59:40,867 --> 00:59:42,307
You really are...

960
00:59:42,307 --> 00:59:44,707
a brazen playboy.

961
00:59:47,547 --> 00:59:49,586
Are you usually very busy?

962
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,007
Today is the only day I'm not working overtime.

963
00:59:52,526 --> 00:59:54,026
You're not working overtime, yet you brought a computer.

964
00:59:54,026 --> 00:59:55,606
Lawyers don't have office hours.

965
00:59:55,606 --> 00:59:57,827
I need to reply to client emails at any time.

966
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:01,126
Besides work, you can also watch movies with a computer.

967
01:00:01,126 --> 01:00:02,807
So?

968
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,626
Right.

969
01:00:04,626 --> 01:00:06,567
You've ordered the 1,288 afternoon tea.

970
01:00:06,567 --> 01:00:08,726
Why not eat and watch. Right?

971
01:00:08,726 --> 01:00:11,346
I came to find you just because I didn't want to watch a movie with my colleagues.

972
01:00:11,346 --> 01:00:12,637
I came to find you just because I didn't want to watch a movie with my colleagues.

973
01:00:12,637 --> 01:00:14,487
What movie did they want to watch?

974
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,287
If I tell you, you'll be scared.

975
01:00:17,287 --> 01:00:21,466
They were watching a movie called Andrei…

976
01:00:23,427 --> 01:00:24,787
Wait, An…

977
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,626
Andrei…

978
01:00:27,546 --> 01:00:28,867
It doesn't matter. What matters is that it was

979
01:00:28,867 --> 01:00:29,936
It doesn't matter. What matters is that it was

980
01:00:29,936 --> 01:00:31,227
a three-hour profound art film,

981
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,196
a three-hour profound art film,

982
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:35,166
very good for sleeping.

983
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:37,097
Then let's not watch something so boring.

984
01:00:37,097 --> 01:00:38,967
May I use your computer?

985
01:00:40,746 --> 01:00:42,240
Thank you.

986
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:48,687
I have a high taste in movies.

987
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,307
If you don't choose well,

988
01:00:50,307 --> 01:00:52,206
I will look down on you.

989
01:00:52,206 --> 01:00:54,567
So, do you want to watch something sophisticated or something good?

990
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:55,717
So, do you want to watch something sophisticated or something good?

991
01:00:55,717 --> 01:00:57,747
These two shouldn't be contradictory. Right?

992
01:00:57,747 --> 01:00:59,404
Indeed.

993
01:01:01,026 --> 01:01:03,487
Do you often watch movies like this with others?

994
01:01:03,487 --> 01:01:05,232
This is the first time.

995
01:01:14,267 --> 01:01:16,040
Sorry.

996
01:01:17,487 --> 01:01:19,008
Shall we start?

997
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:21,338
♫ I want to extinguish all the lights in the world ♫

998
01:02:21,338 --> 01:02:27,098
