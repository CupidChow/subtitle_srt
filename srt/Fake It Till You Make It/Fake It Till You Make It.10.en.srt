- What a coincidence.

- Waiting for someone?
- Yes, such a coincidence.

17

Long time no see. I'm waiting for my girlfriend.

You have a girlfriend now?

It's a shame then. See you around.

It's not a shame.

Aren't you my girlfriend?

You slept so well yesterday, and it made you silly?

You slept so well yesterday, and it made you silly?

00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,039
Maybe because someone's body pillow was too comfortable, I slept very soundly.

All the houses in Beijing are the same.

Our requirements are very simple.

This place won't work. The floor is too low.

- Ziquan, you left in such a hurry last time.

175
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:26,920
I have a younger brother who deals wine.

176
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,940
Not the kind of brother you make outside.

177
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,280
He's educated and talented. I feel... you two can work on something together.

178
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,200
He's educated and talented. I feel... you two can work on something together.

179
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,039
All right, give me his WeChat,

180
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,260
and I'll contact him directly. Okay?

181
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,740
Do you know this wine?

182
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,120
I thought it was a three-no product.
(A product with questionable quality that has no expiry date, no quality certificate, and no mention of manufacturer.)

183
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,540
But after a search on the internet, it's quite popular.

184
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,200
I know. They say its wine cellar They say its wine cellar has many different technologies

185
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,559
I know. So what you're saying is that it's a wine cellar that has many different technologies

186
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,440
I know. So what you're saying is that it's a wine cellar that has many different technologies

187
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,279
- that make this wine taste different from other wines. Right?
- Right, that's the one.

188
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,879
- that make this wine taste different from other wines. Right?
- Right, that's the one.

189
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,800
I don't know if it's true, but the hype is big.

190
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,620
But seriously, if this case succeeds,

191
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,159
But seriously, if this case succeeds,

192
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,200
do you have enough people? You only have two members.

193
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,120
That's why I called you over to discuss it.

194
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,160
Do you think this is appropriate?

195
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,540
The Aroma last time, and the wine this time,

196
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,880
both cases were initiated by you.

197
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,300
What's inappropriate about it?

198
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,879
You're aware of the current situation.

199
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:15,820
The infighting is so severe that any case I do,

200

The infighting is so severe that any case I do,

201

Ada wants a share.

202
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,040
If we don't stick together at this time,

203
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,059
who else can I trust?

204
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:30,200
Besides, didn't you tell me that if one gets married,

205
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,440
they won't have time for a career?

206
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,940
- If you don't help me, who will?
- Right.

207
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,760
- If you don't help me, who will?
- Right.

208
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:41,800
Wait! What do you mean by getting married? When did that happen?

209

Wait! What do you mean by getting married? When did that happen?

210

Who is this person? Who can tame a demon like you?

Who is this person? Who can tame a demon like you?

I have to meet her later and give her a kowtow.

I have to meet her later and give her a kowtow.

214

No need for later, you can kowtow to me first.

Go away.

216

So, it's settled then? We'll do this together?

It's not you. Family matters.

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,220
I went through my wallet, but my ID was gone.

345
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,559
He kept my ID and household register.

346
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,720
I thought I was being paranoid.

347
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,140
He kept emphasizing that snooping on my phone and hiding my clothes

348
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,880
He kept emphasizing that snooping on my phone and hiding my clothes

349
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,720
were because he cared too much about me.

350
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,800
But I'm scared and creeped out now.

351
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,860
You're not being paranoid, sister.

352
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,100
This is very scary.

353
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,599
He's kidnapping you in the name of love.

354
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:41,160
Don't let him get in your head.

355
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,372
Who is it?

356
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,380
Who is it?

357
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,919
He followed me.

358
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,400
The door's open.

359
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,300
Xinzi, come in and change your shoes.

360
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,659
Okay.

361
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:36,400
Ziquan, we're back.

362
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,859
- You're back?
- Yeah.

363
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:39,740
One more dish, and we'll eat.

364
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,039
Okay, it smells good.

365
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:42,920
- Wear the green ones.
- Okay.

366
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,720
- Wear the green ones.
- Okay.

367
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,860
Sorry for the trouble.

368
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,839
- It's okay.
- What are you talking about?

369
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:48,840
- Hey…
- It's the truth.

370
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,279
Ying, come help me.

371
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,219
Xinzi, make yourself at home.

372
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:55,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

373
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,980
I'm here. What do you need?

374
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,240
- Can you ladle the soup?
- Okay.

375
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,180
Is the bathroom in the room inside?

376
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,240
Turn left up front.

377
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,100
Why didn't you let me pick you up?

378
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,000
It's okay. Xu Jiabai is not a bad person.

379
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,099
There's no safety issue. Taking a taxi is convenient.

380
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:10,880
There's no safety issue. Taking a taxi is convenient.

381
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,240
Besides, you were cooking. Right?

382
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,308
Put that in the middle.

383
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,279
Your house is so big.

384
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:22,599
You two haven't thought about living together?

385
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,399
- We've thought about it.
- No, we haven't.

386
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,359
- Shared rental.
- Not yet.

387
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,400
Wait! You two are really out of sync.

388
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,180
I was a little sad,

389
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,319
but you made me laugh.

390
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,900
Let's eat.

391
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,000
Did you make all these dishes yourself?

392
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yep. Try them out and tell me if they're good.

393
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,699
They're really good.

394
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,660
Your cooking is almost better than my dad's.

395
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,480
- You flatter me.
- Exaggerated.

396
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,979
Really.

397
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,820
Did you buy this house by yourself?

398
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,020
-I just finished paying the mortgage.
- Are you checking his household registration?

399
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,280
- I just finished paying the mortgage.
- Are you checking his household registration?

400
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:08,180
They all say a man who can cook is better than a tall, rich, and handsome one.

401
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,640
They all say a man who can cook is better than a tall, rich, and handsome one.

402
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,808
Look. He respects you so much and treats you so well.

403
00:25:11,808 --> 00:25:14,799
Look. He respects you so much and treats you so well.

404
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,319
You two should get married soon and have a child.

405
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,440
You two should get married soon and have a child.

406
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,460
Could you talk less and eat instead?

407
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,199
Thanks for the kind words.

408
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,620
Your sister just left like this.

409
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,359
Is it safe?

410
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:37,200
Don't worry, their company offers apartments for clients

411
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,340
who come to Beijing on business trips.

412
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,000
There is a vacant room.

413
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,200
She's already arrived and called me to say she's safe.

414
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,640
She's already arrived and called me to say she's safe.

415
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,459
But it can't go on like this.

416
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,300
They need to break up completely.

417
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,480
After so many years of seeing her struggle, I've figured it out.

418
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,559
After so many years of seeing her struggle, I've figured it out.

419
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,500
Here's my conclusion.

420
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,559
Unless she really wants to break up,

421
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,859
Unless she really wants to break up,

422
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,799
no advice will work.

423
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,599
So, however painful the realization, it takes personal experience.

424
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,020
So, however painful the realization, it takes personal experience.

425
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,500
Now, it's just you and me.

426
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,200
How about we experience something, too?

427
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,200
Xu Ziquan, something has been on my mind.

428
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,580
Xu Ziquan, something has been on my mind.

429
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,600
Looking at your interior design, was it because you were talking about marriage with your ex?

430
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,720
Looking at your interior design, was it because you were talking about marriage with your ex?

431
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,200
Looking at your interior design, was it because you were talking about marriage with your ex?

432
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,319
Looking at your interior design, was it because you were talking about marriage with your ex?

433
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,960
Is this the bridal chamber?

434
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,240
That wardrobe, that tall cabinet is obviously

435
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,459
for girls to put dresses in.

436
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:50,899
for girls to put dresses in.

437
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:52,799
You left half of it empty,

438
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,440
I can understand that after all,

439
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,519
you can put your suits there.

440
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,559
you can put your suits there.

441
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,920
But what about your three-tier pull-out jewelry cabinet?

442
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,300
But what about your three-tier pull-out jewelry cabinet?

443
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,899
You don't usually wear jewelry.

444
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:03,859
You need at least fifty friendship rings to fill it.

445
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,240
You need at least fifty friendship rings to fill it.

446
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:09,500
We have a long night ahead of us, and we can talk about a lot.

447
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,240
So, do you want me to ask you one by one,

448
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,960
So, do you want me to ask you one by one,

449
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,279
or do you want to confess?

450
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,060
Can we just stop talking?

451
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,992
No.

452
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,839
Excuse me. Who are you looking for?

453
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,680
Xu Jiabai.

454
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,540
Xu? Which department is he from?

455
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,299
Financial Business Department.

456
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,920
How do you spell his name?

457
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,459
I can't find it here.

458
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:45,920
XU, JIA, and BAI.

459
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,580
XU, JIA, and BAI.

460
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,820
You can just give him a call

461
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,780
and say Miss Lin is waiting for him at the front desk.

462
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,559
Are you sure he's from our company?

463
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:01,659
Yes, I've been to your office before.

464
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:04,140
Wait a moment. I'll call and ask.

465
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,700
Hello?

466
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,559
There's a lady at the front desk looking for Xu Jiabai.

467
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,520
But I don't see him in the system.

468
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,260
Okay, I got it.

469
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:19,480
I'm sorry, I asked around and found out

470
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,459
Xu Jiabai was persuaded to leave two weeks ago.

471
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,860
Is there anything else I can help you with?

472
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:31,300
Thank you.

473
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,132
You're welcome.

474
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:37,312
[Fitness Center]

475
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,624
Let it go! Let it go!

476
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,660
Let it go.

477
00:28:56,564 --> 00:28:57,216
- Mu.
- Brother Hao.

478
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,240
- Mu.
- Brother Hao.

479
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,339
You also work out here. I've never seen you before.

480
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,639
- Yeah, working out.
- Are you okay?

481
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:05,160
- I'm fine, bro.
- Are you sure?

482
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,859
Do it again. Let me see what's wrong.

483
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:08,400
Where's the problem?

484
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,100
Hey, no, wait.

485
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,759
You're off center. Center it.

486
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:13,979
Your center of gravity is off now.

487
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:16,020
You have to use this clip.

488
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,599
If you drop one side,

489
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,820
the other side will come straight down.

490
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,472
Okay.

491
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,076
Go down.

492
00:29:25,076 --> 00:29:26,019
Up.

493
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:28,200
- Come on. Get up.
- No, it hurts.

494
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,899
You need a proper diet to train better.

495
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,699
Mu, you're just too thin.

496
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:34,640
Listen! You have to consume carbs, meat, all of it.

497
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,040
Listen! You have to consume carbs, meat, all of it.

498
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,319
First, gain some mass.

499
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,520
Okay, bro, can I hang out with you from now on?

500
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,020
You have no idea.

501
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,200
Work has been so stressful recently.

502
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,000
It's been affecting my sleep.

503
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,039
It's been affecting my sleep.

504
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,519
I'm sweating all the time.

505
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:53,000
You guys must be exhausted.

506
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,312
Right.

507
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,870
How is your Aroma project going?

508
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,868
Barely surviving.

509
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,608
I have a question I really want to ask you.

510
00:30:05,608 --> 00:30:06,624
Go ahead.

511
00:30:06,624 --> 00:30:08,759
For example, the Aroma project.

512
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:10,759
We initially negotiated it,

513
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,939
and Ms. Xu provided the bottom line.

514
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:14,380
Eight percent, right?

515
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,280
But some people just quote lower.

516
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,379
Even at a loss, they want to compete with you.

517
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:19,959
What can you do about that?

518
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,459
Why would they work at a loss?

519
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:26,259
You have no idea.

520
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:29,360
Actually, the boss didn't want to take it at first.

521
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,920
But because the Green Energy case failed, and the Walrus case fell through,

522
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
But because the Green Energy case failed, and the Walrus case fell through,

523
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,919
we didn't have many options.

524
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,200
Bro, we found out today

525
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,339
their raw material supplier has raised the price again.

526
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,419
As you're aware, all global suppliers are facing production cuts.

527
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:42,319
As you're aware, all global suppliers are facing production cuts.

528
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,339
As you're aware, all global suppliers are facing production cuts.

529
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:45,920
If they can't find new suppliers,

530
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,480
their financial numbers next year will look very bad.

531
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,000
So they must report the materials this year.

532
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,419
Without an agreed price, the contract can't be signed,

533
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:57,759
and time is getting tighter.

534
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,360
So our quotes are almost at the bottom line.

535
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,580
But we didn't expect there would still be people…

536
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,180
Forget it.

537
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,820
Mu,

538
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,680
if I were you, I'd jump ship now.

539
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:19,340
Eight percent dropping to six percent.

540
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,759
It's just two percentage points, but Xu Ziquan can't think of it.

541
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,400
It's just two percentage points, but Xu Ziquan can't think of it.

542
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,680
He can't let it go, but Ada can.

543
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,439
Maybe Xu Ziquan is just not good enough.

544
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:29,140
You won't have a future following him.

545
00:31:35,508 --> 00:31:36,360
Mu.

546
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,640
Boss, Jin Hao spilled it.

547
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,160
In order to compete with us,

548
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Ada lowered the price to six percent.

549
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,979
All right, I got it. Goodbye.

550
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,279
Hey, Richard.

551
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,799
You might as well not go to the company today, just to be safe.

552
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,740
You've decided to confront Ada?

553
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,100
Yes, and it's time to dig up the old accounts of Green Energy.

554
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,780
Yes, and it's time to dig up the old accounts of Green Energy.

555
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,000
You can handle it.

556
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,720
We're all in the same company.

557
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Don't make it too ugly.

558
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,319
Don't worry, I understand.

559
00:32:21,184 --> 00:32:22,679
Miss Ada.

560
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:23,752
- What did you need?
- Have a seat.

561
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:24,600
- What did you need?
- Have a seat.

562
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,279
That won't be necessary. Go ahead.

563
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,480
I heard your quote was withdrawn. Right?

564
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,579
Which quote?

565
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:33,200
We have more than a dozen projects in hand.

566
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,159
Why don't you talk to Xiaoxuabout the specifics?

567
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,599
You were supposed to have a meeting with a European aroma raw material company tonight. Right? At 10:00?

568
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:41,400
You were supposed to have a meeting with a European aroma raw material company tonight. Right? At 10:00?

569
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,359
You were supposed to have a meeting with a European aroma raw material company tonight. Right? At 10:00?

570
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,079
But from what I know, you can't have this meeting tonight.

571
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,540
But from what I know, you can't have this meeting tonight.

572
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,859
Sit.

573
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:53,840
Xiaoxu, can you get me a coffee?

574
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,360
Okay.

575
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,080
When Ms. Xu told me you also provided a quote, I wasn't surprised.

576
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,280
When Ms. Xu told me you also provided a quote, I wasn't surprised.

577
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,939
And last time when the Green Energy case was ruined,

578
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:12,799
I didn't say anything.

579
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,859
After all, you're the leader.

580
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,679
Even if we have to talk, it should be Richard.

581
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,899
Richard, how could he possibly come and talk to me?

582
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:26,159
I know you two are old classmates.

583
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,580
You had been working together for seven or eight years before I joined the industry.

584
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,440
But then, for some reason, conflict arose.

585
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,259
But then, for some reason, conflict arose.

586
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:34,599
But that's your personal grudge, and it has nothing to do with me. Right?

587
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:37,780
But that's your personal grudge, and it has nothing to do with me. Right?

588
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,899
All I care about now

589
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:40,880
is knowing who it is exactly that is messing around between our two teams.

590
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,480
is knowing who it is exactly that is messing around between our two teams.

591
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,280
Xu Ziquan, you're a smart man.

592
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,520
Xu Ziquan, you're a smart man.

593
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,519
When I see smart people unable to use their full potential,

594
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,039
When I see smart people who are unable to use their full potential,

595
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,420
When I see smart people who are unable to use their full potential,

596
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,640
it just makes me anxious.

597
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,540
That won't be necessary. I'm not worried.

598
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,504
By the way,

599
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,360
the issue of raw material reduction is something I made up.

600
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,060
I'm very grateful you withdrew your quote.

601
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,420
So, I made an appointment with the head of the compliance department.

602
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,760
I don't need to talk to you anymore. Right?

603
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,020
Thank you for all your effort.

604
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,672
Take care.

605
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,856
The door's open.

606
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,099
You're back.

607
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,120
I'm back. You can go back to sleep.

608
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,944
No.

609
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,599
Xu Ziquan, in the future,

610
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,559
Xu Ziquan, in the future,

611
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,440
let's not have all-night-long chats. Okay?

612
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,360
We can solve the problems during the day.

613
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,519
Today, I felt like I was about to collapse at the law firm.

614
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,199
Today, I felt like I was about to collapse at the law firm.

615
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,860
Oh my god.

616
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,440
Thankfully, my boss had mercy and let me come back.

617
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,519
Otherwise, I could have died at the law firm today.

618
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:03,599
How about you?

619
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,539
How was your day?

620
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,880
Tired, but at least,

621
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,880
I solved a problem.

622
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,760
Stop cleaning and come sit for a bit.

623
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,500
No problem, I'll clean first.

624
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,899
You know, you look just like my dad right now.

625
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:21,080
You know, you look just like my dad right now.

626
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,599
Really, you're exactly like my dad.

627
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,340
You're meticulous and thoughtful,

628
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,719
but you like to do it in front of me.

629
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:32,460
but you like to do it in front of me.

630
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,000
It makes me feel so guilty that I have to do it with him.

631
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,119
It makes me feel so guilty that I have to do it with him.

632
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,519
I didn't force you to do it. Right?

633
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:40,400
If you don't do it, I will.

634
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,000
Anyway, you could have just cleaned it up after you ate.

635
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,380
Anyway, you could have just cleaned it up after you ate.

636
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,920
But you know, there are times when you're just really tired.

637
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,519
But you know, there are times when you're just really tired.

638
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:49,260
Too tired to even speak.

639
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,599
Even eating this meal

640
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,679
used up the very last bit of my energy.

641
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:53,559
used up the very last bit of my energy.

642
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,599
I just wanted to take a nap and clean up after I woke up. What's wrong with that?

643
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,519
I just wanted to take a nap and clean up after I woke up. What's wrong with that?

644
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,740
Yes, you can, that's correct.

645
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,880
But have you ever thought about that when you wake up, this room will be filled

646
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,119
But have you ever thought about that when you wake up, this room will be filled

647
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,520
with the smell of leftover takeout?

648
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,259
Can it smell good?

649
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,300
It's not very pleasant.

650
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,400
I ate and I napped, but this smell does feel a bit unpleasant.

651
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,419
I ate and I napped, but this smell does feel a bit unpleasant.

652
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,180
So, remember to clean up next time.

653
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,760
That's it?

654
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,219
No more complaining?

655
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:37,899
No more complaining.

656
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,800
What's wrong?

657
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,019
Does this count as our first

658
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:46,000
quarrel since we started dating, no,

659
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,780
since we started living together?

660
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,040
No, how could this be considered a quarrel?

661
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,159
This is at most a little friction in our living habits.

662
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,159
This is at most a little friction in our living habits.

663
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,199
This is at most a little friction in our living habits.

664
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,460
This is at most a little friction in our living habits.

665
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,719
But I clearly felt that you were impatient just now.

666
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,800
But I clearly felt that you were impatient just now.

667
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,880
- Was I?
- Yes.

668
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,080
- Was it obvious?
- It was obvious.

669
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,679
I'll definitely pay attention next time.

670
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,860
And I-I've already opened up the spikes on my body ready to retaliate,

671
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,500
And I-I've already opened up the spikes on my body ready to retaliate,

672
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,800
And I, I've already opened up the spikes on my body ready to retaliate,

673
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,800
but you didn't even give me any room to maneuver.

674
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,039
You're making it sound like we're not familiar with each other.

675
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:18,519
You're making it sound like we're not familiar with each other.

676
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:20,520
But we're not very familiar, are we?

677
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,960
We went from strangers to friends,

678
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,119
then to intimate lovers,

679
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:29,280
the process of you in me and me in you…

680
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,848
Wait.

681
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,179
Let's underline this.

682
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,500
What do you mean by "you in me"...

683
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,159
and "me in you"?

684
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,920
You're so annoying.

685
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,719
It's not about being annoying.

686
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,039
With this conversation, if I don't push you down on the sofa…

687
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,360
With this conversation, if I don't push you down on the sofa…

688
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,008
Get down.

689
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,079
Can you throw away your stupid phone?

690
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,560
It's really getting in the way.

Hello, Xinzi! What's wrong?

694
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,679
- Sis.
- What's going on?

695

This is my leader, Mr. Hu.

696
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,200
He received a call from the company's security, and he rushed over too.

697

I checked in yesterday, and the security here found out

699
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,519
as soon as I left, there was a shadow lurking in the hallway.

700

as soon as I left, there was a shadow lurking in the hallway.

Jiabai called again to see me.

- Xinzi's sister.
- Hello.

704
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,960
You don't have to worry too much. I've had security hold him back.

705
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,720
You don't have to worry too much. I've had security hold him back.

706
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,780
I won't let anyone harm her.

707
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,560
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

708
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,660
He even followed you here.

709
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,660
But did he install any surveillance here?

710
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,040
But did he install any surveillance here?

711
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,840
I suspected the same. I've been looking for a while but I can't find it.

I suspected the same. I've been looking for a while but I can't find it.

- It's okay.
- Let me do it.

717

- It's okay.
- Let me do it.

718

Xinzi, what are you planning to do now?

719
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,419
Let me think about it.

720
00:40:12,419 --> 00:40:14,459
Reluctant to break up?

721
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,000
I think he is a bit outrageous now.

722
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,919
I think he is a bit outrageous now.

723
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,519
Don't you find it creepy?

724
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,199
He does have some overstepping behavior.

725
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,800
He does have some overstepping behavior.

726
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,059
But his kindness to me is real.

727
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:32,819
Maybe he loves me too much.

728
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:35,600
But is this really the love you want?

729
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,428
But...

730
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,579
doesn't every relationship have flaws?

731
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,840
He has his good points.

732
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,000
I just feel we can't easily dismiss a person completely.

733
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,259
I just feel we can't easily dismiss a person completely.

734
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:54,280
When I decided to be together with him, I considered a lot.

735

When I decided to be together with him, I considered a lot.

736
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:58,679
So I think even if it's a breakup,

737
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:01,120
I need to think about it again.

738
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,036
Actually, I think…

739
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,520
Where are you?

740
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,259
I'll be late. I want to stay with my sister and talk to her.

741
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,880
A friend of mine is coming to see me,

742
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,519
so I might leave early.

743

We just started eating.

Invite your friend to join us.

745
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,280
Anyway, with more people, we can order more dishes.

Okay, great.

He's my college roommate,

How did you become so strong?

Come on, sit down quickly.

00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,519
Let me introduce you.

757
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,719
My colleague Xinzi.

758
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,240
This is Xinzi's sister, Miss Tang.

759
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,380
- This is Mr. Cheng.
- Hello, Miss Tang.

Hello, Mr. Cheng.

761
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,440
Hello. Can I have a drink, the same as hers?

762
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,119
- Okay, wait a moment.
- Thank you.

00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:13,920
Just as you arrived,

764
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,120
I need your help.

Xinzi's boyfriend

766
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,119
has a strong desire for control.

767
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:22,000
So, he installed a surveillance camera at her door,

768

So, he installed a surveillance camera at her door,

769

monitoring her whereabouts every day.

00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,640
So the young lady is scared now. Right?

771
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,960
She's temporarily staying in the company's apartment.

772
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,300
But this young man is very capable.

773
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,500
He followed her to the company apartment

774
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,700
and also installed a camera in the apartment hallway.

775
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,559
Now I'm at a loss. You old fox, hurry up and come up with an idea.

Now I'm at a loss. You old fox, hurry up and come up with an idea.

777
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:42,540
So you're pretending not to know me, Tang Ying?

778
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,619
It's such a coincidence, Old Hu.

779
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:50,419
Not only do I know this young lady,

780
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:54,440
we're from the same town

781
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,800
and she was my neighbor.

Ten years ago,

783
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,979
I went to her house to tutor her.

784
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:02,199
This is just so coincidental. How is this possible?

This is just so coincidental. How is this possible?

786
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,240
I was afraid you didn't recognize me.

your habits and preferences remain the same.

All right, the family recognition is over.

Anyway, about this matter,

797
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:39,280
you can't solve the problem by avoiding it.

hiding is pointless.

And secondly, some problems,

We really don't know what Xu Jiabai is thinking.

806

By avoiding it like this,

807
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,760
you'll be even more passive.

You were sending me weird messages.

00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,920
Scumbag.

869
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,000
You need to stop labeling me as a scumbag, I'm telling you.

870
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,400
You need to stop labeling me as a scumbag, I'm telling you.

871
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,320
Come here, I'll show you something.

872
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,256
What is it?

873
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:11,280
Take a look.

874
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,440
So delicate.

875
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,220
Whose child is this?

876
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,064
My daughter.

877
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,460
So you're going out on dates,

878
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,020
and even seeing your illegitimate daughter.

879
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,220
My goddaughter.

880
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,880
Look.

881
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,320
Look at you.

882
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,519
This is Jiang Cheng's daughter. I went to the hospital to keep him company today.

883
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:36,859
This is Jiang Cheng's daughter. I went to the hospital to keep him company today.

884
00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:40,380
I waited all night for his wife to give birth.

885
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,919
This might just be the delayed sense of happiness for me.

886
00:49:41,919 --> 00:49:44,960
This might just be the delayed sense of happiness for me.

887
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:50,740
Look at that. Life is truly wonderful.

888
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,264
Yes.

889
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,920
Xinzi.

890
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,720
Xu Jiabai, let go.

891
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,900
I miss you so much.

892
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,100
You're hurting me,

893
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,070
Let go!

894
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,920
Xinzi, when you're not home, the house feels so empty.

895
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,800
It doesn't feel like a home at all.

896
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,720
Would you come home with me?

897
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,920
How could I go home with you like this?

898
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,440
You snoop on my phone, follow me,

899
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,199
and install surveillance at my apartment door.

900
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,719
You'd quit your job some time ago, but you kept it from me.

901
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:50,519
You'd quit your job some time ago, but you kept it from me.

902
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:51,639
I don't even know who I'm dating anymore.

903
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:52,800
I don't even know who I'm dating anymore.

904
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,180
What kind of person is he? Is he a pervert?

905
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,860
Are you afraid of me?

906
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,400
Shouldn't I be?

907
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,320
Xinzi, when you're not here, every moment of every day, I'm thinking about you.

908
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,579
Xinzi, when you're not here, every moment of every day, I'm thinking about you.

909
00:51:10,579 --> 00:51:12,719
Haven't you missed me at all?

910
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:14,400
Let's talk about it at home.

911
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,620
Don't touch me.

912
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,359
Can we go somewhere with people around?

913
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,859
Where do you suggest we go?

914
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,359
Shall we talk here?

915
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,960
There are people here, and there's surveillance.

916
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,120
Don't be scared, I won't do anything to you.

917
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,204
All right.

918
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,199
I know that there are only two outcomes today.

919
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:10,120
Either we go home,

920
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:13,660
or we break up.

921
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:26,499
I should apologize to you first.

922
00:52:26,499 --> 00:52:28,190
I'm sorry.

923
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,699
I shouldn't have snooped on your phone.

924
00:52:31,699 --> 00:52:32,840
You caught me red-handed, and I can't explain.

925
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,099
You caught me red-handed, and I can't explain.

926
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,919
I've always felt inferior.

927
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,840
And I feel particularly insecure when it comes to you.

928
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,719
And I feel particularly insecure when it comes to you.

929
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:49,800
You always find a way to make me feel

930
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,920
like I'm good for nothing.

931
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,059
It's not your fault.

932
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,119
It's just that you're too good.

933
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:00,019
But isn't that just how people are?

934
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:01,280
We always want to hold onto the best firmly with our hands.

935
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,419
We always want to hold onto the best firmly with our hands.

936
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,740
Is it wrong that I want to hold onto you?

937
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,792
No, it's not.

938
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,519
You have countless pursuers on your phone every day,

939
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:14,480
You have countless pursuers on your phone every day,

940
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,760
annoying you, pestering you, and hoping that we would break up immediately.

941
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,459
annoying you, pestering you, and hoping that we would break up immediately.

942
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,159
Sometimes I wonder, I just wonder, why are you so happy and so joyful

943
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,400
Sometimes I wonder, I just wonder, why are you so happy and so joyful

944
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,199
Sometimes I wonder, I just wonder, why are you so happy and so joyful

945
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:28,239
Sometimes I wonder, I just wonder, why are you so happy and so joyful

946
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:30,199
when you send WeChat messages to them?

947
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:32,099
I don't know...

948
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,199
- what you think of them and how you feel about me.
- You're overreacting.

949
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,820
- what you think of them and how you feel about me.
- You're overreacting.

950
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,400
- what you think of them and how you feel about me.
- You're overreacting.

951
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,200
Jiabai,

952
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:51,280
haven't I given you enough sense of security?

953
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,600
You don't want me to wear short skirts or camisoles,

954
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,200
You don't want me to wear short skirts or camisoles,

955
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,519
and I stopped wearing them.

956
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:01,039
Ever since we got together,

957
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:02,559
when I go out to eat with other people,

958
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,379
I always feel as if I'm doing something wrong.

959
00:54:06,919 --> 00:54:10,019
But I think it's a normal social life.

960
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,399
Doesn't the fact that you installed surveillance at my apartment door...

961
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,439
prove that you have a psychological problem?

962
00:54:17,439 --> 00:54:21,999
prove that you have a psychological problem?

963
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,060
I have a psychological problem? I have a psychological problem.

964
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,619
I have a psychological problem? I have a psychological problem.

965
00:54:29,619 --> 00:54:31,639
When I found out you went out with that Mr. Hu, do you know what I thought?

966
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,780
When I found out you went out with that Mr. Hu, do you know what I thought?

967
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,800
I don't know what you're doing with him, you know?

968
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,239
I overthink and make wild guesses.

969
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:43,720
You don't think you've done anything wrong, do you?

970
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,519
Don't you find it creepy?

971
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,400
I didn't do anything.

972
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,079
But the fear I experienced is no less than yours. Do you understand?

973
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,888
But the fear I experienced is no less than yours. Do you understand?

974
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,800
If you can't accept me looking at your phone, I won't look.

975
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,040
If you can't accept me looking at your phone, I won't look.

976
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:06,840
If you can't accept me hiding things, I won't hide anything.

977
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,060
If you can't accept me hiding things, I won't hide anything.

978
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,280
I can change everything for you. I can change everything, all right?

979
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,819
I can change everything for you. I can change everything, all right?

980
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:22,359
Xinzi, I know I lack a sense of propriety.

981
00:55:22,359 --> 00:55:24,460
I have a strong desire for control.

982
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:34,560
But I-I'm afraid of losing you, okay?

983
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,140
I'm afraid.

984
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:40,940
You can say that I have a personality defect.

985
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,959
You can say anything about me.

986
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,630
But my love for you is more genuine than anyone else's.

987
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:53,540
♫ I guess I'll be falling ♫

988
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:59,980

Xu Jiabai, you should know that only you can save yourself.
