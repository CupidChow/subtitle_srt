Sure.

24
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,072
Thank you.

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,520
Miss Han, what's going on?

26
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,460
I know when I was away from the law firm,

27
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,679
you've helped our team a lot.

28
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,220
Especially Ziyao.

29
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,519
She told me that you've been a great help on the case.

30
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,440
She told me that you've been a great help on the case.

31
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,840
It's the least I can do.

32
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,019
Actually, I know my team members pretty well.

33
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,440
For instance, Ziyao. She's been with me for so long,

34
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,960
For instance, Ziyao. She's been with me for so long,

35
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,720
and there must be some resentment in her heart.

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,999
But what I didn't expect was that during the hardest time in my life,

37
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:57,640
But what I didn't expect was that during the hardest time in my life,

38
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,219
she was able to stand in my shoes,

39
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:06,159
help me solve problems, and genuinely be on my side.

40
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,360
I am really moved.

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,000
Just now, in the final version of the report to the client, she discovered errors.

42

Just now, in the final version of the report to the client, she discovered errors.

43
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,080
Just now, in the final version of the report to the client, she discovered errors.

44
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,560
If it had been sent like that, we might have lost the case.

45
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,439
Miss Han, there are two reports here for you to take a look.

46
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,620
Miss Han, there are two reports here for you to take a look.

One is our internal report, and the other is for the client.

Not bad. You've improved.

The law firm's regular employment process is starting again.

53
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,719
Although the quota is limited this year,

54
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,579
I'll write a good report for you.

55
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,800
We now have a lot of cases in our team,

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,860
and it's just when we're short-staffed, so you need to work hard.

57
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,260
Thank you, Miss Han. I'll get back to work.

58
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,599
Ziyao.

59
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,240
Thank you for the time when I wasn't here.

60
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,879
No problem. It's my duty.

61
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,879
I don't believe that nobody had pointed it out to her,

62
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,800
I don't believe that nobody had pointed it out to her,

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,879
and she did it on her own.

64
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,159
So, thank you.

65
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,940
I am just doing my job.

66
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,919
Enough with the compliments. I'll get embarrassed.

Enough with the compliments. I'll get embarrassed.

With the educational institution business, my husband was trying a transformation,

70
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,639
With the educational institution business, my husband was trying a transformation,

71
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,839
and with so many things at the law firm,

72
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,759
I was really going to break down.

73
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,419
I thought everything would be over.

74
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:26,959
You and Wang Yusu will take this opportunity to get rid of me.

75
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,319
You and Wang Yusu will take this opportunity to get rid of me.

76
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,080
But I didn't expect…

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,580
Seriously, thank you.

78
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,300
Don't thank me anymore.

79
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,160
How's it going at home? Is it okay now?

Halfway through life, at worst, we'll start over. It's okay.

I hardly see him lately.

98
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,620
That's the thing, Mr. Liu. Richard has been liaising with a new project recently.

99

Has he? I'm not sure.

101
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,940
However, as his subordinate, you should remind him to fulfill his duty.

102

However, as his subordinate, you should remind him to fulfill his duty.

However, as his subordinate, you should remind him to fulfill his duty.

104

Don't forget what he should do because of his high position.

Miss Ada, is this… a formal invitation to me?

110
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,180
Miss Ada, is this… a formal invitation to me?

111
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,700
Yes, let me get straight to the point.

112
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,300
Richard and I had some disagreements in the past,

113
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,360
but I don't pick fights unless I'm provoked.

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,560
but I don't pick fights unless I'm provoked.

115
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,800
If someone crosses me, I won't let them have an easy time.

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,360
If someone crosses me, I won't let them have an easy time.

117
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,399
What I did before was not aimed at you, and I hope you won't take it to heart.

118
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,000
What I did before was not aimed at you, and I hope you won't take it to heart.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,279
Ziquan, with your abilities, you deserve a bigger stage.

120
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,020
Ziquan, with your abilities, you deserve a bigger stage.

121
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,359
If you're willing to join my team, I'll provide you with the best resources.

122
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,459
If you're willing to join my team, I'll provide you with the best resources.

123
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,199
Miss Ada, I've always thought you were the strongest MD in the company.

124
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,359
Miss Ada, I've always thought you were the strongest MD in the company.

125
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,880
Working with you is everyone's dream.

126
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,479
Working with you is everyone's dream.

127
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,420
However, with Richard around,

128
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,960
it wouldn't be right for me to join you.

129
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,760
Although, my invitation stands indefinitely.

130
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,399
Our team is always open to you.

131
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:53,439
The asking price is high.

132
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,000
It's definitely high, but the partners make a lot.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,480
Tang, come over here.

134
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,399
Mr. Zheng. Miss Wang.

135
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,720
I was just telling Miss Wang how you did a great job on this case.

136
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,180
I was just telling Miss Wang how you did a great job on this case.

137

Shi Zhi Literature City has withdrawn the lawsuit against Maomao.

138
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,859
The agreement was just signed.

139
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:15,180
It's already signed?

140
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,240
They were in a rush, and you weren't here,

141
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,720
They were in a rush, and you weren't here,

142
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,800
so they left after signing.

143
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,140
It's all right. I'm happy for Maomao.

144
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,900
And about Mr. Ma's case,

145
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,079
we all know that you played a crucial role in it.

146
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,360
we all know that you played a crucial role in it.

147
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,260
Your contribution to the resolution is undeniable.

148
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,859
Tang, the HR Department will notify you soon.

149
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,739
Congratulations on your promotion, Miss Tang.

150
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,819
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

151
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,160
Would you like a drink? I'll get it.

152
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,900
I'm still in a daze right now.

153
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,099
I feel like I'm dreaming.

154
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,439
Promotion is a good thing,

155
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,519
but you'll have more responsibilities and more pressure.

156
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,100
but you'll have more responsibilities and more pressure.

157
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,020
Can your slight frame handle it?

158
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,839
I know. I'm just a bit tired recently.

159
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,480
I know. I'm just a bit tired recently.

160
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,720
I'll pick a weekend to go out, relax, and rejuvenate.

161
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,120
I'll pick a weekend to go out, relax, and rejuvenate.

162
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,040
Don't pick a weekend. Do it this weekend.

163
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,740
I won't assign you any tasks.

164
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,560
Clear your mind and consider it a promotion reward.

165
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,140
Clear your mind and consider it a promotion reward.

166
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,980
Sis, you're too good to me.

167
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,920
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

168
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,040
I mainly want to tell you that your salary won't be adjusted until the beginning of next year.

169
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,399
I mainly want to tell you that your salary won't be adjusted until the beginning of next year.

00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,460
Disappointed?

172
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,519
Not at all.

173
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,380
This is the policy of the firm.

174
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,800
After a promotion, there needs to be an observation period. Right?

175
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,699
It's good that you think so.

176
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:43,600
Anyway, after the promotion,

177
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
you should still live your life well.

178
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,700
Don't always stay overtime in the law firm.

179
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,020
You'll regret it in a few years.

180
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,459
Got it. I just want to fight harder while I'm young.

181
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,099
Don't worry.

182
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,419
Off work? I'm waiting for you downstairs.

183
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,760
Boyfriend?

184
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,459
I have some good news to tell you.

185
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,519
I have some too, but you go first.

186
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,219
All right, I'll go first. I got promoted.

187
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:17,080
That's indeed great news. Let's go and eat something delicious.

188
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,240
That's indeed great news. Let's go and eat something delicious.

189
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,019
But I didn't get a raise.

190
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,039
That's no problem.

191
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:23,240
The most important thing is the promotion, you know.

192
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,880
What about your good news?

193
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,679
My good news is that I've taken on a new project.

194
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,240
My good news is that I've taken on a new project.

195
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,840
Look, how good is that? You got promoted, and I'll earn money.

196
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,740
Then you have to treat me to something delicious.

197
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,939
Sure, but I see that the wonton stall seems to be open.

198
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:36,720
Sure, but I see that the wonton stall seems to be open.

199
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,739
- Shall we go eat wontons?
- Cheapo.

200
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:41,200
- Mu.
- Boss.

201
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,900
Why are you in such a rush?

202
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,768
I'm off work.

203
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:46,960
Hello, Sister-in-law.
- What's the matter? No need to salute. Really…

204
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,840
Hello, Sister-in-law.
- What's the matter? No need to salute. Really…

205
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,099
- Okay, go back quickly.
- Okay, Boss, goodbye. Goodbye, Sister-in-law.

206
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:53,399
- Okay, go back quickly.
- Okay, Boss, goodbye. Goodbye, Sister-in-law.

207
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,720
Mu is really cute.

208
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Mu, though he's a rich second generation, let me tell you, in work,

209
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,799
Mu, though he's a rich second generation, let me tell you, in work,

210
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,639
he's not sloppy at all, very serious.

211
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,980
Without him, that Aroma case might still be in the air.

212
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,500
Without him, that Aroma case might still be in the air.

213
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,779
Then I would have died in the old industrial area.

214
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,440
In the workplace, it's rare to have someone always on your side.

215
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,559
In the workplace, it's rare to have someone always on your side.

216
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,600
- Treat him well.
- Of course.

217
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,320
- Treat him well.
- Of course.

218
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,960
In a workplace full of intrigue, everyone is on guard.

219
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,259
Having a trustworthy person is very important.

220
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:23,720
Do you remember what I told you about Ziyao?

221
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,040
Before Miss Han returned, Ziyao always had her back, bearing all the pressure.

222
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
Before Miss Han returned, Ziyao always had her back, bearing all the pressure.

223
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,580
Before Miss Han returned, Ziyao always had her back, bearing all the pressure.

224
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,179
Mr. Zheng doesn't know what happened even now.

225
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:34,259
Miss Han invited me for coffee today

226
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,440
and said thank you to me.

227
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,300
It was quite heartwarming.

228
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,200
Although I can't change this environment,

229
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,059
I can still do something meaningful.

230
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,760
That is... if everyone can do a little bit more

231
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,200
That is.. if everyone can do a little bit more

232
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,080
and a little better than yesterday,

233
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,520
and a little better than yesterday,

234
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,599
then this world would be a lot different.

235
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,539
then this world would be a lot different.

236
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:57,179
Have you heard about this?

237
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:00,480
Everyone is walking on the road with a lifetime of history,

238
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,539
and half a month of sorrow.

239
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:03,919
I used to think that, too.

240
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,120
I felt so lost and lonely.

241
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,259
But after meeting you, I feel different.

242
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:14,140
Wait... How different?

243
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,039
I feel... somehow secure.

244
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,819
I feel... somehow secure.

245
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,700
I make you feel secure?

246
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,859
In the past, no matter how hard or tiring life was,

247
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:29,100
there was no one by my side.

248
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,120
Now, you're here with me.

249
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,979
It's like...

250
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,600
having a candy in my mouth.

251
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,320
No matter how bitter life gets, it tastes sweet.

252
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,819
I also have a candy in my mouth right now.

253
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,784
Let's go home and continue.

254
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,519
The case you mentioned is actually very typical.

255
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,399
When the website learned of the infringement,

256
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,200
it did not immediately take measures

257
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,640
to stop the link and stop the infringement.

258
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,380
You've told me so much about e-commerce law.

259
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,939
Should I pay Professor Yan?

260
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:25,060
You can ask me anytime,

261
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,359
and I will provide an answer.

262
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,579
Your mom's condition has improved a lot.

263
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:37,720
Don't worry, I'll take care of things at home.

264
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,670
You can work with peace of mind.

265
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,968
Yusu,

266
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,000
we've known each other for so long.

267
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,659
If you are having any difficulties, just tell me.

268
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:54,320
If you are having any difficulties, just tell me.

269
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,200
If there's anything I can help you with…

270
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,799
It's okay.

271
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,380
Don't keep things in your heart.

272
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,800
Talk it out, and it might make you feel better.

273
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,480
I don't even know where to start.

274
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,120
The day I met you in the bar, I just came back from my hometown.

275
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,679
The day I met you in the bar, I just came back from my hometown.

276
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,360
My mom was hospitalized after a car accident.

277
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,939
She never complimented me from childhood to adulthood.

278
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:26,840
When I was applying for university, my grades were good enough to get into the top Chinese Department.

279
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,360
When I was applying for university, my grades were good enough to get into the top Chinese Department.

280
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,919
- Wipe her down.
- She secretly changed my application

281
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,239
to the Law Department of another university.

282
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,960
She's always been like that, trying to turn me into what she expects me to be.

283
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,260
She's always been like that, trying to turn me into what she expects me to be.

284
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,519
After I entered university, I finally escaped from her control.

285
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,719
After I entered university, I finally escaped from her control.

286
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,880
Gradually, we had nothing to talk about.

287
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,799
All the ties of kinship

288
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:58,240
are gradually moving away.

289
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,540
Talk more with your mom.

290
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,700
The doctor said that a conversation

291
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,140
is good for her to regain consciousness.

292
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,279
She might even wake up.

293
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,319
I'm afraid she'll never wake up,

294
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,039
and I'm also afraid that after she wakes up,

295
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,520
I still can't make her understand

296
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,639
that I can live well the life I want to live.

297
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,779
She's still so stubborn even now.

298
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,519
A few years ago, I saved some money

299
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,660
and wanted to buy a house in Beijing.

300
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,039
But at that time, my father suddenly fell ill.

301
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,939
But at that time, my father suddenly fell ill.

302
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:52,559
The down payment turned into medical expenses.

303
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,560
At that time, I had a boyfriend,

304
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
we were together for five or six years.

305
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,840
But I don't know why,

306
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,140
at that time, a project caught the attention of the chairman's daughter,

307
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,979
at that time, a project caught the attention of the chairman's daughter,

308
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,160
and he was straightforward, eloquently writing a small essay,

309
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,040
and he was straightforward, eloquently writing a small essay,

310
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,599
explaining how he fell in love with this young lady.

311
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:13,980
I was so moved when I read it.

312
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,620
A month later, on WeChat Moments,

313
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,060
they even posted their wedding photos.

314
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,939
Quite dramatic, isn't it?

315
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:22,699
Like a TV drama.

316
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:24,459
But it's all in the past.

317
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:27,480
I believe in the law of darkness in life.

318
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,919
During the growth stage, people will all experience some dark moments

319
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,739
During the growth stage, people will all experience some dark moments

320
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:36,300
of pain, confusion, and helplessness.

321
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,799
The only thing you can do is

322
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,800
wait, struggle, and get through it.

323
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,079
Actually, life is quite simple.

324
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,619
As long as you take these pains and troubles as a matter of course,

325
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:51,480
As long as you take these pains and troubles as a matter of course,

326
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,320
when you see them, you will be as calm as when you meet an old friend.

327
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,539
when you see them, you will be as calm as when you meet an old friend.

328
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,280
Here we go again.

329
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,860
Let me know in advance next time so I can be prepared.

330
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,599
Let me know in advance next time so I can be prepared.

331
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:05,620
And then it will pass.

332
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,300
Yeah, I like your mentality now.

333
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,099
Yeah, I like your mentality now.

334
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,312
Praise me.

335
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,679
Wang Yusu, you are the best of all the women I've ever met.

336
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,039
Wang Yusu, you are the best of all the women I've ever met.

337
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,659
Best of all?

338
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:25,700
Are you only saying this to me?

339
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,879
Wang Yusu, you are the best of all the women I've ever met.

340
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,640
Wang Yusu, you are the best of all the women I've ever met.

341
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,699
I'm just kidding with you.

342
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,820
Today, it was the tenth restaurant.

343
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,660
So, was what you said before serious?

344
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,140
The time limit of ten restaurants.

345
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,640
Every word I said to you was serious.

346
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,360
But you also said,

347
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,920
whether you love someone, you'll know at the first encounter.

348
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,720
whether you love someone, you'll know at the first encounter.

349
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,459
So, I know your answer now.

350
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,399
What do you know?

351
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,979
You don't feel anything for me.

352
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,500
How could a woman who feels nothing for you

353
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,799
honestly accompany you for ten meals?

354
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,319
honestly accompany you for ten meals?

355
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,680
When a man and a woman have ten meals in two weeks,

356
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,019
there can only be one reason.

357
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,920
Because of love.

358
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,900
Do you have plans for the weekend?

359
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,480
What? You want a date with me?

360
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,659
I want to invite you to a picnic.

361
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,000
My boss gave me a vacation. She told me to have a good rest.

362
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,839
My boss gave me a vacation. She told me to have a good rest.

363
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,239
All right! But let me tell you,

364
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,960
a couple's picnic can be risky and easy for a quarrel.

365
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,359
I won't quarrel with you. Will you quarrel with me?

366
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,220
I won't fight with you either. I'm only good at negotiating.

367
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,860
Where do you want to go?

368
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,520
Where do you want to go?

369
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,579
Jiang Cheng once told me about a good camping spot.

370
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:38,160
It's in the suburbs of Beijing. Should we go camping?

371
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,680
Sure, camping. Then I'll need to…

372
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,359
What?

373
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,040
Buy camping equipment.

374
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,780
Are you in such a hurry?

375
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,319
Can't we just use Jiang Cheng's?

376
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,079
No way! The process of buying equipment is very fulfilling.

377
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,599
No way! The process of buying equipment is very fulfilling.

378
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,739
Besides, using our own will definitely feel different.

379
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:57,740
Later, we can often go camping.

380
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,739
Right? All right, go ahead.

381
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,799
My baby, you really put out the college entrance examination vigor in everything.

382
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,600
My baby, you really put out the college entrance examination vigor in everything.

383
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,559
What's wrong? Isn't it good?

384
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,860
It's good, very good.

385
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,000
But like me, I only have this vigor at work and on motorcycles.

386
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,879
But like me, I only have this vigor at work and on motorcycles.

387
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:15,440
So, we complement each other; a perfect match.

388
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,880
All right.

389
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,939
Eat first, then shop later.

390
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:49,340
Slow down. Be careful.

391
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,079
Come on. Rinse your mouth.

392
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,799
Be careful.

393
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,700
You've got it all over your face.

394
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,839
Here, be careful.

395
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,152
Be careful.

396
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,900
You're just a kid. What do you know?

397
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,919
Sure, I don't know.

398
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,240
Who did you drink so much with?

399
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,340
What kind of job is worth risking your life?

400
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,260
Your words have a suspicion of insulting my job.

401
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,259
Your words have a suspicion of insulting my job.

402
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:35,660
Let me tell you! I studied advertising for four years.

403
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,760
Advertising work.

404
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,839
Our line of work is tough.

405
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,920
I went out with the leader

406
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,000
to meet the advertising company.

407
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,499
And drank like this?

408
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,739
Slow down, slow down.

409
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,968
Be careful.

410
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,000
Your leaders are too pedantic,

411
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,740
letting a girl like you to drink so much.

412
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,819
The drinking culture is so outdated.

413
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:29,539
- Little brother.
- Wait! Be careful.

414
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,536
- Little brother.
- Wait! Be careful.

415
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,810
Lin Xinzi, don't sleep here.

416
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,490
Wake up.

417
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,280
Can you walk by yourself? Lin Xinzi?

418
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,100
Lin Xinzi.

419
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,200
All right, come out for breakfast.

420
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,439
I'm running late for a meeting. I won't eat now.

421
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,680
Wait! What?

422
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,699
Grab a piece of bread to eat on the way, here.

423
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,739
Slow down. Don't rush.

424
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:09,739
Be careful on the road.

425
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,388
Everyone on the team is here today.

426
00:22:17,388 --> 00:22:19,004
Brother Shan.

427
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,200
Ziquan.

428
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,792
- Ziquan.
- Mr. Liu.

429
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,739
Where are your people?

430
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:29,299
Just a moment, they'll be here soon.

431
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:33,200
Look! All the bosses are here, waiting to sign the contract.

432
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,119
No, brother, I don't understand.

433
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,400
Why do you have to use this Xu Ziquan?

434
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,159
Let me tell you! This kid,

435
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,799
I've researched him.

436
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:45,440
He has a good character, not shady at all.

437
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,580
He's not snobbish. He doesn't despise the poor and love the rich.

438
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,180
I guarantee he's a decent guy.

439
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,500
I'm really good at judging people, believe it or not.

440
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,799
He went to high school in the US

441
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,580
and university in Hong Kong.

442
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,200
As for his master's degree, I remember it was either from Tsinghua or Peking University.

443
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,399
What else do you want?

444
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:03,860
- All right.
- Right?

445
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:07,279
Brother Shan, they're here.

446
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,340
- We can start the meeting now.
- Good, Mr. Liu.

447
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,559
All right, good.

448
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,920
Then let's start the meeting.

449
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,979
All right, please.

450
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:17,072
After you. Let's go.

451
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,980
Let's go.

452
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,620
You're not taking care of me anymore.

453
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,500
I'll put the water here for you. In case you get thirsty.

454
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,620
I'll put the water here for you. In case you get thirsty.

455
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,160
What's up? I see you're not very busy lately, huh?

456
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,199
What's up? I see you're not very busy lately, huh?

457
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,279
Brother, after going through this ordeal,

458
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,720
I've learned to chill out.

459
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,960
Let me tell you!

460
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,160
How should I put it, in life,

461
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,600
actually, everyone has to experience some lows.

462
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,640
But as long as you get through it,

463
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,079
there will be a clear sky.

464
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,720
Right.

465
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,320
We… We are brothers from different families.

466
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,059
We… We are brothers from different families.

467
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:33,200
I'm not like him. I'm not educated.

468
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,039
But, Brother, it's not relevant.

469
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,960
Let me tell you.

470
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,540
When you work on this IPO thing,

471
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,319
I will definitely support it fully. Right?

472
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,739
But you must do it professionally. You must be reliable.

473
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:50,559
If you secure this for him,

474
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,019
I will make it worth your time. Right?

475
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:56,540
You can't just mess around because we're good brothers.

476
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,820
Right? Don't fudge it.

477
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,519
Let me tell you, brother. Just keep your heart in your stomach.

478
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,400
Rest assured and at ease.

479
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,039
- I will definitely handle this matter clearly and brightly, okay?
- Okay.

480
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,299
- I will definitely handle this matter clearly and brightly, okay?
- Okay.

481
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,279
Do I speak Northeastern Chinese authentically?

482
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,319
- Standard.
- Right?

483
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,520
- Nice.
- Absolutely.

484
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,880
Absolutely.

485
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,540
All right.

486
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,760
You're back so early.

487
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,844
There wasn't much to do today.

488
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,939
I wrote a new song. Do you want to hear it?

489
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,892
All right.

490
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,000
It sounds so good.

491
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,800
I just posted it on my moments

492
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,100
and all the comments are praising you.

493
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,119
I'm becoming your career-oriented mom fan.

494
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,620
Career-oriented mom fan?

495
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,660
That is, like your mom,

496
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,080
I hope your career will thrive.

497
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,620
It's really quite like my mom.

498
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,299
You little brat. What are you saying?

499
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,580
Thanks for yesterday.

500
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,879
We're roommates. Don't mention it.

501
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,519
I didn't do anything embarrassing yesterday, did I?

502
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,099
No, you were quite cute.

503
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,279
That's good, anyway…

504
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,620
I can't remember anything anymore.

505
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,740
But next time, you better not drink so much.

506
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,519
It's very dangerous if you run into bad people.

507
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,359
Actually, I went to socialize with the leaders yesterday,

508
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,939
and I didn't hold my liquor.

509
00:28:20,939 --> 00:28:23,499
Thank you for your concern.

510
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:25,880
You're welcome, sister.

511
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,699
Do your best. I hope you can write more beautiful songs.

512
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:32,579
Career-oriented mom fan.

513
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:34,279
Go for it!

If you have friends around you who want to change jobs or something,

516
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,640
If you have friends around you who want to change jobs or something,

517
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,700
I have some influence in the company,

518
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,839
I can help with internal referrals.

519
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,240
Impressive, but my surroundings are all kids.

520
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,640
The requirement of over five years of experience is too high.

521
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,540
It's really a pity.

522
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,039
How long has it been since you graduated?

523
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,160
Over three years.

524
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,079
That's about right.

525
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,759
If you want to come, I can arrange it.

526
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,380
Don't feel embarrassed.

527
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,639
For me, it's just a matter of saying a word.

528
00:30:29,258 --> 00:30:31,208
[Cheng Ke]

529
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:34,080
- Hello?
- Do you want to have dinner together?

530
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,140
- Hello?
- Do you want to have dinner together?

531
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,139
I wanted to consult you on a few legal issues.

532
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:41,540
I'm already downstairs at your place.

533
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,219
Ten years ago, you were also waiting for me downstairs at my place.

534
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:46,739
Ten years ago, you were also waiting for me downstairs at my place.

535
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:50,340
Does it feel a bit familiar?

536
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,680
You're going out?

537
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,440
You finished golfing so fast?

538
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,256
Yes.

539
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,039
Cheng Ke asked me to have dinner.

540
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,920
I didn't want to go at first. He said he wanted to ask me some legal questions.

541
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,520
He's already downstairs.

542
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,319
I'm feeling now,

543
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:31,939
would it be inappropriate not to go?

544
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:33,599
But I'm really, really annoyed.

545
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,599
I don't want to go at all.

546
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,599
You're meeting him in your peach sweater and pajama pants?

547
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,859
See? I haven't even dressed up.

548
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:42,839
I just threw on something. Put on a coat and go.

549
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,280
I just threw on something. Put on a coat and go.

550
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,139
I don't plan to eat with him. I'll talk with him downstairs and come back up.

551
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,119
You said you wanted beef brisket rice. I bought it for you.

552
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:49,919
You said you wanted beef brisket rice. I bought it for you.

553
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,680
What do you think? Are you going to eat it first or

554
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,040
take it with you and eat it with him?

555
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,848
How about this?

556
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,580
Call him up here. I'll meet him.

557
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,680
- Are you sure?
- It's fine.

558
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,480
- Are you sure?
- It's fine.

559
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,440
I'm going to take a shower.

560
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,540
Heal, heal.

561
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,224
He's here.

562
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:19,380
- Mr. Cheng.
- Ying.

563
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,220
- Mr. Cheng.
- Ying.

564
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,079
Change your shoes first.

565
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,119
Come in.

566
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:29,060
You're so polite. Thank you.

567
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,319
Your house is really…

568
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:34,720
You're here? Come on in.

569
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,179
Your roommate is here, too.

570
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Let's sit down first, come on.

571
00:33:07,864 --> 00:33:08,279
- Thank you.
- Ziquan, this is for you.

572
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,340
- Thank you.
- Ziquan, this is for you.

573
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,440
Thank you.

574
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,992
Please sit.

575
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,160
Nice house.

576
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,459
Facing south, the lighting should be good.

577
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,160
How much is your property fee here?

578
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,960
I don't know.

579
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,799
That's right. Most young people who are struggling in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou

580
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,859
That's right. Most young people who are struggling in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou

581
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:33,899
are renting houses. Right?

582
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,000
I bought a bigger one in Guangzhou,

583
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,599
facing north and south.

584
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:43,880
From every balcony, you can see the Canton Tower.

585
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,480
When you get a chance to go to Guangzhou, I'll show you around.

586
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,900
When you get a chance to go to Guangzhou, I'll show you around.

587
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,000
Great. If there's a chance, we can go together.

588
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,596
Okay.

589
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,079
But speaking of which, the price of houses in Beijing is indeed too expensive.

590
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:57,360
But speaking of which, the price of houses in Beijing is indeed too expensive.

591
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,119
The appreciation potential can't compare with that of Guangdong.

592
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,319
A few years earlier, I bought two more properties.

593
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:06,380
Do you know how much the price has risen now? It's almost more than 100,000 per square meter now.

594
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,620
Do you know how much the price has risen now? It's almost more than 100,000 per square meter now.

595
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,939
I guess it's a small success from my investment years ago.

596
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,480
No more games?

597
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,840
I find your conversation more interesting.

598
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,280
Let me listen and learn.

599
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,719
Learn what? Don't rush, take your time.

600
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,760
Most young people love to play when they're young. It's normal.

601
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,800
Most young people love to play when they're young. It's normal.

602
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,460
At your age, I loved to study some investment-related books.

603
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,840
At your age, I loved to study some investment-related books.

604
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,320
I almost became a Chartered Financial Analyst.

605
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,220
In these two years, I plan to take the Judicial Examination.

606
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,280
Why do you want to take the judicial exam as an internet entrepreneur?

607
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,639
I have always been keen on the matter of self-improvement.

608
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,000
I have always been keen on the matter of self-improvement.

609
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,639
You know that, too.

610
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,599
But, Xu, if I may.

611
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,760
At your age, I think you should learn about investment matters.

612
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,280
At your age, I think you should learn about investment matters.

613
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,360
At your age, I think you should learn about investment matters.

614
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,400
Don't always play video games. It's a waste of time.

615
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,079
Yes, of course.

616
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,360
I-I was indeed…

617
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,680
thinking about doing something.

618
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,440
But... never mind.

619
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,519
What are you embarrassed to say?

620
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,680
Like what?

621
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,320
For example, like this house I bought two years ago.

622
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,359
For example, like this house I bought two years ago.

623
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:18,880
It's less than tripled in value this year.

624
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,120
But at that time, I had a project which has increased by more than ten times this year.

625
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,920
But at that time, I had a project which has increased by more than ten times this year.

626
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,360
If I didn't buy this house at that time, I would have done this project directly... Right?

627
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,800
If I didn't buy this house at that time, I would have done this project directly... Right?

628
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,880
Now I can buy several houses, like you. Right?

629
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,179
Now I could buy several houses, like you. Right?

630
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:31,079
For the view, you can see the Canton Tower,

631
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,480
and I'll look at the China Zun. Right?

632
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,200
But your vision is far-sighted.

633
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,879
I-I thought you two were renting together.

634
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:44,740
That's right, we are renting together.

635
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,679
Yes, I'm renting his house.

636
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,479
You didn't make it clear.

637
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,300
I'm sorry. No, no.

638
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,448
I'm sorry. No, no.

639
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:52,896
Okay.

640
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,704
I see, it's old money.

641
00:35:58,704 --> 00:35:59,600
- Right?
- Old money…

642
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,808
- Right?
- Old money…

643
00:36:01,808 --> 00:36:03,020
In Xu's case, it's obvious that he's the type that young and beautiful girls love:

644
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,760
In Xu's case, it's obvious that he's the type that young and beautiful girls love:

645
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,880
rich, young, and fun.

646
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,180
Sure enough, he's also constantly in love.

647
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,760
Ying, the girl we met downstairs earlier,

648
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,700
the one who hugged him,

649
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,159
she was pretty and eligible.

650
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,260
So that's your type.

651
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,740
No wonder. Right?

652
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,519
She was really not my type,

653
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,340
and I never beat around the bush about what I don't like.

654
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,020
and I never beat around the bush about what I don't like.

655
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,220
About this point, Ying should know it best. Right?

656
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,000
About this point, Ying should know it best. Right?

657
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,440
Yes, I know. She even mentioned it to me,

658
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,159
said that you blocked her immediately.

659
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:39,220
What's that thing called? Blacklisted. Right?

660
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,840
- She cried for over a decade.
- Over a decade?

661
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,960
- She cried for over a decade.
- Over a decade?

662
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,039
No, ten years.

663
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:44,400
- No, I didn't.
- Five years.

664
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,416
No.

665
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:49,159
Really? Did you cry for so many years?

666
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,800
So I appeared later on.

667
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,679
I'm the one who wipes her tears, massages her when she's tired,

668
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,100
I'm the one who wipes her tears, massages her when she's tired,

669
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,879
and cooks for her when she's hungry. That's it.

670
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,639
Let me see you off.

671
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:11,459
Take care and come visit more often.

672
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,400
I didn't get to talk to you much tonight.

673
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,500
Didn't you say you had something to ask me?

674
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,272
Let's go for a walk?

675
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,064
Okay.

676
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:05,780
If you have anything to say, just say it.

677
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,720
It's been ten years, and a lot has happened.

678
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,380
You've changed, and so have I.

679
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,640
I've changed to liking you.

680
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,319
Are you confessing to me?

681
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,172
Yes.

682
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,939
Are you sure you want to confess to me

683
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:35,220
after just meeting my boyfriend?

684
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:42,579
It's been ten years, Ying, and you're still so stubborn.

685
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,620
I'm telling you! This man…

686
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,559
This man is really good. He's smart and talented.

687
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,400
This man is really good. He's smart and talented.

688
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,920
He has style. I like everything about him.

689
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,220
And just because of this, you two are not suitable.

690
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,619
Do you think you're worthy of him?

691
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
I know you won't like it when I say this,

692
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,080
I know you won't like it when I say this,

693
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,599
but I'm really speaking from the heart.

694
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,880
but I'm really speaking from the heart.

695
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,360
He's a man, and I'm a man.

696
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,160
What are men most afraid of?

697
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,300
Temptation.

698
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,599
I guarantee that he's with you now just because it's new.

699
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,540
I guarantee that he's with you now just because it's new.

700
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,960
What about after the novelty wears off? What will you do alone?

701
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,680
What about after the novelty wears off? What will you do alone?

702
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,679
Life is not some Mary Sue novel.

703
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,559
He's tall, rich, handsome, and ignores the white, rich, and beautiful for Cinderella?

704
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:35,339
He's tall, rich, handsome,
and ignores the white, rich, and beautiful for Cinderella?

705
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,199
Wake up.

706
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:39,180
Men in love are the most realistic.

707
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,199
Men in love are the most realistic.

708
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:44,979
Throughout history, only women have been kidnapped by love.

709
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:46,320
And the rich second generation like him,

710
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,880
I'm telling you, I've seen a lot.

711
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,199
What these rich second generations value are family status and a match in social class.

712
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,319
What these rich second generations value are family status and a match in social class.

713
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:54,840
They look at women: first, at the face, and then, the body.

714
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,119
But in the end, they still look at family background.

715
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,240
So tell me, what advantage do you have in front of him?

716
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,700
So tell me, what advantage do you have in front of him?

717
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:03,960
Mr. Cheng, ten years ago when I asked you for lessons, you got paid.

718
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,520
Mr. Cheng, ten years ago when I asked you for lessons, you got paid.

719
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,120
But now I won't pay for lessons from you.

720
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,520
But now I won't pay for lessons from you.

721
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,740
Besides, why?

722
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,599
Why am I not good enough for him?

723
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:19,559
I'm good-looking, healthy, financially independent,

724
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,599
and he just wants to be with me.

725
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,099
He can't stop thinking about me and he loves me to the point of madness.

726
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:24,719
He can't stop thinking about me and he loves me to the point of madness.

727
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:25,960
Don't think that everyone will turn love into a transaction.

728
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,999
Don't think that everyone will turn love into a transaction.

729
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:29,220
What did you just say? Men can't resist temptation?

730
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,340
What did you just say? Men can't resist temptation?

731
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,800
Well, women are the same.

732
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,960
Right now, for me, Xu Ziquan is much more tempting to me than you.

733
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,280
Right now, for me, Xu Ziquan is much more tempting to me than you.

734
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,860
Thinking of him makes me happy.

735
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,960
I bounce as I walk, I eat two bowls of rice,

736
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,079
I bounce as I walk, I eat two bowls of rice,

737
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,200
and I can climb twenty flights of stairs without panting.

738
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,880
Maybe one day, my novelty will wear off first

739
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,760
and I might just kick him away.

740
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,880
I have to say, Tang Ying, you really have grown up.

741
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,599
Of course, I have.

742
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:57,420
You are kind of a disappointment to me now.

743
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,260
- A disappointment?
- Yes.

744
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,639
A big disappointment.

745
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,639
I really prefer the old you.

746
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,540
If you put it that way, Cheng Ke,

747
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,760
you have disappointed me.

748
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,240
I disappointed you?

749
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,659
Do you know what disappoints me the most about you?

750
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:18,920
It's been ten years,

751
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,079
but you haven't changed at all.

752
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,440
Ten years ago, you would call me a little fool when I made a mistake in my homework.

753
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,559
Ten years ago, you would call me a little fool when I made a mistake in my homework.

754
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,159
Ten years ago, you would call me a little fool when I made a mistake in my homework.

755
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,260
When I was lazy, you called me a little bug.

756
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,280
Now you actually still want to control me with that trick.

757
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,539
Now you actually still want to control me with that trick.

758
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,460
It's the 5G era.

759
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,480
Just because I liked you when I was young,

760
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,239
it doesn't mean I have to like you and worship you for the rest of my life.

761
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:42,239
Mr. Cheng, where does your confidence come from?

762
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,079
All right, let's call it a night.

763
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,739
My boyfriend is waiting for me to go home for dinner.

764
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:14,560
Little brother.

765
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:22,119
The three people I just mentioned to you,

766
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:26,320
Chen Mo, Xu Jiabai, and Brother Hu.

767
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,160
Of course, Brother Hu was not my boyfriend.

768
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,779
I'm almost 26 now,

769
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,000
but my love life has been getting worse and worse.

770
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,060
Do you think there's something wrong with me?

771
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:46,440
Although I don't have much experience, I always feel that,

772
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,280
Although I don't have much experience, I always feel that,

773
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,079
when two people are together, character is the most important thing.

774
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,960
when two people are together, character is the most important thing.

775
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,440
If one person is always unconditionally caring for and coaxing the other person,

776
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,360
If one person is always unconditionally caring for and coaxing the other person,

777
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,179
it would be unbearable for anyone.

778
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,319
Nobody wants that.

779
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,499
What kind of person do you think I should look for?

780
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,939
You should look for someone you like, whatever kind.

781
00:43:17,939 --> 00:43:19,940
Aren't you a modern, independent woman?

782
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,019
Why are you so traditional in your thinking?

783
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:25,360
Who says a woman has to be married before she's 28?

784
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,340
- Who said that?
- Who said that?

785
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,400
I didn't say that.

786
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,820
You just said it yourself.

787
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,119
No, I learned it from an online relationship blogger.

788
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,319
No, I learned it from an online relationship blogger.

789
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,000
I didn't say that.

790
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,280
Anyway, you clearly can't achieve it. Just give up already.

791
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,440
Anyway, you clearly can't achieve it. Just give up already.

792
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,539
Let it be. Who cares?

793
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,940
Who's given up?

794
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,000
You open your eyes and take a good look at me.

795
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,400
How old do I look?

796
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,160
Let me see.

797
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,199
18. At most 18.

798
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,599
I think so, too.

799
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,780
You love to hear this? It makes you happy?

800
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,199
However, you look okay from afar.

801
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:29,340
Up close, your pores are a bit large.

802
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,940
Wait a few more years,

803
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,139
you'll have necklines, crow's feet, and blackheads.

804
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:34,400
you'll have necklines, crow's feet, and blackheads.

805
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,539
How will you find a partner then?

806
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,720
Who did you say has large pores?

807
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,160
No.

808
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,320
You have large pores.

809
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,119
I… I didn't look carefully just now. I didn't look carefully just now.

810
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:45,704
I… I didn't look carefully just now. I didn't look carefully just now.

811
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,360
I took a closer look just now.

812
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,480
Actually, you look quite nice.

813
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,180
Quite nice? What do you mean by quite nice?

814
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:58,819
- Well…
- What do you mean by quite nice?

815
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:00,679
- Well…
- What do you mean by quite nice?

816
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:04,019
Your features are quite beautiful and amazing.

817
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:05,520
Your looks are on point.

818
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,599
You have a nose where a nose should be, and eyes where eyes should be.

819
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,180
So what's the only deficiency?

820
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,719
Well… Your fashion sense can be slightly improved.

821
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:12,800
Well… Your fashion sense can be slightly improved.

822
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,880
These messy clothes, don't wear them in the future.

823
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,180
These messy clothes, don't wear them in the future.

824
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,900
You are somewhat of a beauty. Right?

825
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,039
So you don't have to worry about dying alone in the future.

826
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:20,719
So you don't have to worry about dying alone in the future.

827
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:25,920
You're the one who's going to be alone.

828
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,340
Your fashion sense is good.

829
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,840
Xia Tian, do you treasure your life?

830
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,280
Let me tell you. You've got some balls.

831
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,919
Let me tell you. You've got some balls.

832
00:45:31,919 --> 00:45:33,400
No one has ever dared to scold me like this.

833
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,420
I'm joking.

834
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,280
What kind of joke? No one has ever dared to say this to me.

835
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,719
What kind of joke? No one has ever dared to say this to me.

836
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:39,520
Are you playing? Are you playing?

837
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,320
- Come here.
- Are you playing?

838
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,920
- You play.
- I'm not afraid of you. Let's go.

839
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,320
You. I'm not afraid of anyone.

840
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,952
Come here.

841
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,728
What are you doing?

842
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,548
Let me do it.

843
00:45:57,639 --> 00:45:58,920
How many times have I told you? Don't put this pot up there.

844
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,560
How many times have I told you? Don't put this pot up there.

845
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,719
I'm not tall enough, and I can't reach it. I use it a lot.

846
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:05,320
This cabinet was designed according to my height at the time.

847
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,579
Should we tear it down and modify it?

848
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:09,699
I just said, don't put it so high next time.

849
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:11,559
Okay, I know. I just put it there conveniently.

850
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:14,300
Okay, I'll remember. I'll put it here for you next time.

851
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,916
All right.

852
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,380
But Feijin's financial performance this year is not good. Right?

853
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,139
Right? I'm listening. Go ahead.

854
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:26,800
Its increase this year was...12%. Right?

855
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,940
Its increase this year was...12%. Right?

856
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,019
Right? There's no way around it.

857
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:34,159
And its trial operation sector has also dropped. Right?

858
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:35,400
And its trial operation sector has also dropped. Right?

859
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,992
- Right?
- Ziquan, do you know how to set up this tent?

860
00:46:37,992 --> 00:46:39,020
I do. I can do it.

861
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:39,920
- But it seems to me…
- Wait a minute. Let me have a meeting first.

862
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,420
- But it seems to me…
- Wait a minute. Let me have a meeting first.

863
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,944
- Okay.
- Wait for me for a while.

864
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:46,500
By June 25th,

865
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,400
its increase ratio was 13.4%.

866
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,880
Should I bring disposable underwear?

867
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,760
I don't think we can shower there. Shall we endure it?

868
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,099
We'll be back the next day. Right?

869
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:56,880
Okay, okay.

870
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,119
Okay, I'm with you. Go ahead.

871
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:01,819
Its current valuation is 14.7%.

872
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,599
14.7%. Right.

873
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:06,660
Ranking 22nd. Right?

874
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:10,719
- But I think…
- Can we make a fire at the campsite?

875
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:12,420
Do we need to bring an alcoholic stove or something?

876
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,079
We should be able to.

877
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,400
- I-I'll deal with it after the meeting.
- Okay.

878
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,240
Yes, I'm listening. Okay.

879
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,179
Okay, I'll send it to you.

880
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,420
I'm done, I'm done.

881
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,260
Mr. Xu, you really are not participating at all.

882
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,960
Mr. Xu, you really are not participating at all.

883
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,679
- Okay, okay.
- Here.

884
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:32,920
We don't, actually, need to bring so many things.

885
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,920
But what if we need something? It's in the wild.

886
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,940
But what if we need something? It's in the wild.

887
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,519
The surrounding facilities are not bad.

888
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:41,040
It's a ten-minute drive to the village,

889
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,960
and we can buy things we lack.

890
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,860
It's a dedicated camping site. Right?

891
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,040
Do you really want to go out with me?

892
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,760
Of course, I do.

893
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,179
- Why don't you check where the car is, and we'll bring everything.
- Okay, I'll go get them.

894
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:53,400
- Why don't you check where the car is, and we'll bring everything.
- Okay, I'll go get them.

895
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,559
There are also a lot of things, food, drinks, and stuff.

896
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,640
There are also a lot of things, food, drinks, and stuff.

897
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,700
I'll go get them.

898
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,840
Power bank. Find the power bank for me. Definitely bring it, remember.

899
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,800
Power bank. Find the power bank for me. Definitely bring it, remember.

900
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,272
Hey, Brother Shan.

901
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,920
I'm packing here.

902
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,199
I'm going camping with my girlfriend.

903
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:12,868
How have you been doing lately?

904
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,599
I'll go to another room.

905
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,510
[External Device]
[Music]

906
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,239
Why are you so happy, like a primary school student on a spring outing?

907
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:06,039
Of course, I haven't traveled for a long time.

908
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:07,760
Of course, I haven't traveled for a long time.

909
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,760
Plus, this is our first time traveling together.

910
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,960
Plus, this is our first time traveling together.

911
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:13,499
Although it's a short trip,

912
00:49:13,499 --> 00:49:15,499
it's still worth commemorating.

913
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:19,839
All right, then I'll go along with your

914
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,019
joy of traveling.

915
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:24,159
According to Article 133 of the Criminal Law, this is considered dangerous driving.

916
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:26,619
According to Article 133 of the Criminal Law, this is considered dangerous driving.

917
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:28,800
Miss Tang, if I drive like this,

918
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,860
how long would I be sentenced?

919
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,700
No matter how long,

920
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,260
you can't let me be pitiful outside

921
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,000
you can't let me be pitiful outside

922
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,479
and wait painfully for you to come out. Right?

923
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,900
Poor thing, how can I bear to leave you?

924
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:49,839
We're almost there!

925
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:55,700
- Can you handle it?
- Yes. How come it doesn't fall?

926
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,260
- Can you handle it?
- Yes. How come it doesn't fall?

927
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,280
Like this.

928
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,320
- Carry it.
- Carry it.

929
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,260
Setting up the stall.

930
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:08,679
- We have it.
- Where is it?

931
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:10,916
Inside.

932
00:50:10,916 --> 00:50:11,519
Is this how it works? My stick is so long.

933
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:13,459
Is this how it works? My stick is so long.

934
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:19,040
Do you know how to skip stones?

935
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,699
- I don't.
- Come on, I'll teach you.

936
00:50:21,699 --> 00:50:23,980
No, come and set it up first.

937
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,939
You can go and play after.

938
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,456
It's up.

939
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,988
Oh my god.

940
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,079
- So tired.
- Spider, spider.

941
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,440
Look. Should we do something?

942
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,980
It's fine. Live in peace with it.

943
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,960
All right, we're in nature anyway. Right?

944
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,920
I didn't expect our young man to be so capable.

945
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,159
Right? I told you I could set it up.

946
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,320
My practice is always worth trusting.

947
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,819
So trustworthy.

948
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,808
Perfect.

949
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,900
Look! The neighbors gave us these.

950
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,180
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

951
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,719
Look! Come, the brightest star now is Polaris.

952
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:26,860
In a while, it will rotate and fall onto the horizon.

953
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,119
In a while, it will rotate and fall onto the horizon.

954
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,520
That star, what's that star? What's that star called?

955
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,839
That star, what's that star? What's that star called?

956
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,944
Going to sleep.

957
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:38,599
Is it a bit cold?

958
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,119
Are you cold?

959
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:41,960
It's a bit cold.

960
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,099
Did you pad the moisture-proof mat?

961
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,020
- Where's the mat?
- I don't know.

962
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,540
Didn't you unload the car?

963
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,440
Yes, it wasn't in the car.

964
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,780
I thought we brought it.

965
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,059
Didn't you pack it?

966
00:51:56,059 --> 00:51:57,792
I packed…

967
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:01,320
If you had helped to pack, we wouldn't have forgotten to bring it.

968
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,160
If you had helped to pack, we wouldn't have forgotten to bring it.

969
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,459
I-I- I was on the phone. Right?

970
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:08,239
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

971
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:09,779
I-I... What should we do?

972
00:52:09,779 --> 00:52:12,639
Should we endure for one night?

973
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:14,519
It's okay, let it be.

974
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,199
My phone is out of battery. Give me the power bank.

975
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,079
You didn't bring it. Are you kidding me?

976
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,080
- Didn't I tell you to bring it?
- I'm sorry.

977
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,199
I was wrong, forgive me.

978
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:30,360
I'm sorry. I forgot after hanging up the phone.

979
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,220
This call of yours, really caused a lot of trouble.

980
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,359
This call of yours, really caused a lot of trouble.

981
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,159
Why is someone texting you so late?

982
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:42,139
Should I listen to it?

983
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:44,480
Sure, go ahead.

984
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,300
You look so good in a suit.

985
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,519
Will you wear it again for me to see next time?

986
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,360
I-I don't know why she sent this.

987
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,800
Don't be angry.

988
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,156
I'm sorry. Don't be angry. Okay?

989
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,199
I'm sorry.

990
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:16,139
Don't leave.

991
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:18,360
Why are you everywhere?

992
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,340
- I'm here.
- Get away from me.

993
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,660
- I…
- Don't be angry with me.

994
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,320
No.

995
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,619
Why do you have a pillow here?

996
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,159
That pillow is more comfortable.

997
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:30,160
- This is inflatable.
- Then you sleep there.

998
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,440
This is so comfortable.

999
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,900
I've realized something.

1000
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,648
That is, this pillow is indeed uncomfortable when one person sleeps on it.

1001
00:53:35,648 --> 00:53:37,119
That is, this pillow is indeed uncomfortable when one person sleeps on it.

1002
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,440
But when two people use it…

1003
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,199
Why didn't you realize it earlier? You've been using it.

1004
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:43,860
- Get over there.
- I won't.

1005
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,980
- That's hindsight.
- I want to be your moisture-proof mat.

1006
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,519
I want to be your power bank.

1007
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:52,000
- Power bank.
- Charge, charge, charging you.

1008
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,020
Get away from me.

1009
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,960
Is the word "charge"…

1010
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,319
- You.
- Okay.

1011
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,599
It's a bit cold in the morning.

1012
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:12,328
Yes.

1013
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,256
So cold.

1014
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,519
It's really cold in the morning.

1015
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:35,920
There're only, sandwiches and milk.

1016
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,456
I'll have some milk.

1017
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,024
Are you sure?

1018
00:54:58,119 --> 00:54:59,680
What's wrong?

1019
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,000
It hurts a little. Maybe I caught a cold last night.

1020
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,199
Just that kind of stinging pain.

1021
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:11,019
Zip up your jacket.

1022
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:12,640
It's okay.

1024
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:19,899
Every woman who inadvertently feels a lump in her breast

1025
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:23,240
must feel the same as I do now, I suppose?

[Yu Chuanchuan]

1027
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,416
Should I answer it?

1028
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,519
You can also hang up.

1029
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:52,459
How about this? You take it.

1030
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,880
Get rid of this person who is trying to steal your man.

1031
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,619
Get rid of this person who is trying to steal your man.

1032
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,256
Hello.

1033
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:22,020
Hello.

1034
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:26,099
It's you.

1035
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:28,160
So you know me.

1036
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:31,800
Xu Ziquan is right next to me.

1037
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,760
He gave me the phone to answer.

1038
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,020
I don't believe it.

1039
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,459
You don't have to be so confident.

1040
00:56:40,459 --> 00:56:43,159
Didn't Xu Ziquan tell you who I am?

1041
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:44,800
Do you know how long I've known him? What we've been through before?

1042
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,679
Do you know how long I've known him? What we've been through before?

1043
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:49,460
None of these matters. What matters is...

1044
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,199
if you were even a bit important,

1045
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:54,480
he wouldn't have given me the phone to take this call.

1046
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,220
he wouldn't have given me the phone to take this call.

1047
00:56:56,220 --> 00:57:00,399
So are you sure you want to continue this call?

1048
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,459
What are you looking at? So annoying.

1049
00:57:18,459 --> 00:57:21,760
How about this? Let's go back a bit earlier,

1050
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,440
find a nicer restaurant, and have a good meal.

1051
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,680
find a nicer restaurant, and have a good meal.

1052
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,640
You still don't like camping, huh?

1053
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,119
It's not that.

1054
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,219
Although we…

1055
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:36,679
we didn't solve the food situation well,

1056
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:39,240
everything else was quite good. Right?

1057
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,879
Especially, we solved a fundamental problem.

1058
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:50,679
Resisting the urge to immediately pull out my phone

1059
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:54,079
and search for early symptoms of breast cancer,

1060
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,339
I don't want to cast a shadow over this still somewhat wonderful weekend.

1061
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:59,519
I don't want to cast a shadow over this still somewhat wonderful weekend.

1062
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:01,920
But I can't help thinking,

1063
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,440
God, you wouldn't really play such a big joke on me, would you?

1064
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,740
God, you wouldn't really play such a big joke on me, would you?

1065
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:16,960
♫ Solace in your light in the twilight ♫

1066
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,680
♫ You're the star that guides my way without a spoken word ♫

1067
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,270
♫ I'm reaching out to you ♫

1068
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:27,070
♫ With every breath I feel ♫

1069
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:31,270
♫ The echoes in your voice ♫

1070
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,150
♫ It shines ♫

1071
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:35,660
♫ I'm under a spell ♫

1072
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:39,670
♫ I'm bound by our love ♫

1073
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:44,320
♫ With every step we're intertwined, everything feels right ♫

1074
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,510
♫ I can not help but ♫

1075
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:54,390
♫ Lost in the words I want to say ♫

1076
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:02,310
♫ Together we will chase dreams into the sky ♫

1077
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:06,890
♫ With love as our guide we'll soar and fly ♫

1078
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:12,530
♫ In your love's embrace I've found my bliss ♫

1079
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:15,730
♫ Pure and free ♫

1080
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:24,950
♫ Together we will write our symphony ♫

1081
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:29,400
♫ With every breath, I'm enchanted anew ♫

1082
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:35,130
♫ Wrapped in your arms in this magical room ♫

1083
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:39,420
♫ Just you and me ♫

1084
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:47,580
♫ Together we will chase dreams into the sky ♫

1085
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:52,060
♫ With love as our guide, we'll soar and fly ♫

1086
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:57,730
♫ In your love's embrace, I've found my bliss ♫

1087
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:01,490
♫ Pure and free ♫

1088
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:10,190
♫ Together we will write our symphony ♫

1089
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:14,670
♫ With every breath, I'm enchanted anew ♫

1090
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:20,440
♫ Wrapped in your arms in this magical room ♫
