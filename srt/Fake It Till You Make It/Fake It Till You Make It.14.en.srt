[Fake It Till You Make It]

00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:49,336
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:02,180
You came to our doorstep.

4
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,120
Was there any urgent matter?

5
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,700
What's with your face? Were you born like this?

6
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,979
She's having an allergic reaction.

7
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,479
Ziquan, I've given it some thought.

8
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,140
I misunderstood things before.

9
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,879
From now on, let's just be friends.

10
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,280
Is that okay, sister?

11
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
You probably don't want Ziquan to cut off all his female friends. Right?

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,900
You probably don't want Ziquan to cut off all his female friends. Right?

13
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,380
He broke up with his ex-girlfriend because of this.

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,000
Here's a friendly reminder.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,840
Too much insecurity in a woman will force a man to break up with her.

16
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,280
Too much insecurity in a woman will force a man to break up with her.

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,880
Ziquan often mentions you.

18
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,580
I was quite worried when I heard about your harassment.

19
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,340
I was quite worried when I heard about your harassment.

20
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,200
But looking at your behavior now, I feel relieved.

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,260
But looking at your behavior now, I feel relieved.

22
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,780
It makes sense that you stayed as friends after knowing each other for so long.

23
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,519
It makes sense that you stayed as friends after knowing each other for so long.

24
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,620
What's that saying?

25
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,180
Good-looking skins are all the same, but an interesting soul is one in ten thousand.

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,820
Good-looking skins are all the same, but an interesting soul is one in ten thousand.

27
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,360
Remember to take your allergy medicine.

28
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,399
Thank you, baby.

29
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:09,960
I used to think Xu Ziquan only liked pretty girls.

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,960
I used to think Xu Ziquan only liked pretty girls.

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,560
I didn't expect he only likes those with depth.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,360
I didn't expect he only likes those with depth.

33
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:21,379
Pretty girls are everywhere on the street.

34
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,940
But you're different. I took a good look at you today, and you're extra pretty.

35
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,120
But you're different. I took a good look at you today, and you're extra pretty.

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,120
But I don't understand why such a pretty girl would go after

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,879
But I don't understand why such a pretty girl would go after

38
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,820
a man who has a girlfriend.

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,880
You've been hung up so many times, yet you had to rush to the doorstep.

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,719
You've been hung up so many times, yet you had to rush to the doorstep.

41
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,579
Doesn't that make you a bit cheap?

42
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,900
Doesn't that make you a bit cheap?

43
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,879
I'm not like you.

44
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,699
Ziquan and I are good friends.

45
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,739
I have many male friends.

46
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,200
So when he suddenly got a girlfriend, I found it hard to accept.

47
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,100
So when he suddenly got a girlfriend, I found it hard to accept.

48
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,599
I really envy you then, because my luck with men is terrible.

49
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,800
I really envy you then, because my luck with men is terrible.

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,640
I only have one male friend. Xu Ziquan.

51
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,879
I only have one male friend. Xu Ziquan.

52
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,639
Unfortunately, he pretended to be my friend and tricked me into becoming his girlfriend.

53
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,999
Unfortunately, he pretended to be my friend and tricked me into becoming his girlfriend.

54
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,619
How annoying is that? Really.

55
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:13,100
Sister Chuan, I heard from Ziquan, that you two are of similar age and that you haven't found a boyfriend.

56
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,139
Sister Chuan, I heard from Ziquan, that you two are of similar age and that you haven't found a boyfriend.

57
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,800
Why is that? Is it hard to find one?

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,500
If you put it that way, I do have a type I like.

59
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,839
He must be tall, with a high nose bridge,

60
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,180
He must be tall, with a high nose bridge,

61
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,199
broad shoulders, a small head, good body,

62
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,060
preferably in finance, very warm to his friends, and yet has mature thinking.

63
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,700
preferably in finance, very warm to his friends, and yet has mature thinking.

64
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,439
preferably in finance, very warm to his friends, and yet has mature thinking.

65
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:42,939
Of course, if his name is Xu Ziquan, it would be even better.

66
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,640
I can think of someone, but it's not quite the same as you described.

67
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,600
I can think of someone, but it's not quite the same as you described.

68
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,660
That is, the Xu Ziquan I know, seems professional and mature to outsiders,

69
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,340
That is, the Xu Ziquan I know, seems professional and mature to outsiders,

70
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,139
but in private, he's just a little kid,

71
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,920
always acting like a child, hanging around behind you; extremely childish.

72
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,319
always acting like a child, hanging around behind you; extremely childish.

73
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,760
always acting like a child, hanging around behind you; extremely childish.

74
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,260
Sister Chuan, you still don't know him well.

75
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,360
Yes. When I like a person, I only know to love him dumbly.

76
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,600
Yes. When I like a person, I only know to love him dumbly.

77
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,579
I don't have your insight into human nature, or understanding him thoroughly before being with him.

78
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:27,240
I don't have your insight into human nature, or understanding him thoroughly before being with him.

79
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,760
That is really smart.

80
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,839
Actually, I don't know how it happened. I was clueless.

81
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,860
Actually, I don't know how it happened. I was clueless.

82
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,040
I haven't had much romance in the past few years, but as soon as I met him,

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,380
I haven't had much romance in the past few years, but as soon as I met him,

84
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,819
I was smitten at first sight.

85
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:42,920
Both of us even have a kind of...

86
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,620
yearning for the siege of marriage.

87
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,840
We are like two fools falling into the trap of love.

88
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,799
We are like two fools falling into the trap of love.

89
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,416
Drink?

90
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,900
So what does this make us?

91
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,340
Smart or foolish?

92
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,320
But if it comes to being smart, you really get it.

93
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,820
But if it comes to being smart, you really get it.

94
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,560
You know the thrill of stealing.

95
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,260
Under the name of love, you can satisfy your competitive desire.

96
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,960
Under the name of love, you can satisfy your competitive desire.

97
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
I really don't know if you love yourself more or him.

98
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,679
I really don't know if you love yourself more or him.

99
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:44,439
You were so brave.

100
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,620
I can be so brave

101
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,740
only because your love gave me confidence.

102
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,419
only because your love gave me confidence.

103
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,020
So, this annoying pursuit was resolved like that?

104
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,700
Most likely, I guess.

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,920
People should have some dignity. Right?

106
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,280
I analyzed this before. Those who like to interfere in relationships can be divided into three types.

107
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,560
I analyzed this before. Those who like to interfere in relationships can be divided into three types.

108
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
I analyzed this before. Those who like to interfere in relationships can be divided into three types.

109
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,779
The first type, because of love.

110
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:14,000
For them, I am not a mistress, I am just in love. What's wrong with love?

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,700
For them, I am not a mistress, I am just in love. What's wrong with love?

112
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,160
Besides, I don't want to break you guys up.

113
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,979
I just want to join you.

114
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:24,959
Wait.

115
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,459
That's a peculiar taste.

116
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:32,100
The second type, for a living.

117
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,040
They lack independent survival skills, so they want to find a man and secure the rest of their lives.

118
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,480
They lack independent survival skills, so they want to find a man and secure the rest of their lives.

119
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,220
They lack independent survival skills, so they want to find a man and secure the rest of their lives.

120
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,740
These people are really ruthless.

121
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,380
They stop at nothing and they are extremely patient.

122
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,419
Once they succeed, it's a step to the sky.

123
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,039
A story of Empresses in the Palace?

124
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,440
And there's the third type.

125
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,319
The third type is just boring.

126
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,340
These people don't care who the other person is.

127
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,880
They treat men as spoils of war.

128
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,580
and they specifically target non-single men.

129
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,340
Why? Because they want to satisfy their vanity by defeating another woman.

130
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,340
Why? Because they want to satisfy their vanity by defeating another woman.

131
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,120
Why? Because they want to satisfy their vanity by defeating another woman.

132
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,300
Isn't Sister Chuan obviously the third type?

133
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,240
No, she's a subcategory within the third type, the type of rich and beautiful woman.

134
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,320
No, she's a subcategory within the third type, the type of rich and beautiful woman.

135
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,720
There's a subcategory?

136
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,639
But think about it. Actually, for people like Chuan, there's a queue of men chasing after her.

137
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,739
But think about it. Actually, for people like Chuan, there's a queue of men chasing after her.

138
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:18,819
But think about it. Actually, for people like Chuan, there's a queue of men chasing after her.

139
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,560
Why does she have to pine for one person?

140
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,140
Why?

141
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,180
So, she's very easy to deal with.

142
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,540
Don't be fooled by her aggressive appearance.

143
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,520
It's just a temporary high.

144
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,120
As long as you press down on her self-esteem,

145
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,200
whittle down her abnormal patience in this relationship a little,

146
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,080
whittle down her abnormal patience in this relationship a little,

147
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,479
and she will be resolved.

148
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,740
You analyze this very thoroughly.

149
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,980
But I think, men are also to blame for this.

150
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,080
You were allergic and your face was all swollen up, and he still let you confront that Chuan girl.

151
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,680
You were allergic and your face was all swollen up, and he still let you confront that Chuan girl.

152
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,120
I told him.

153
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,500
- I asked him later, and do you know what he said?
- What did he say?

154
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,640
- I asked him later, and do you know what he said?
- What did he say?

155
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,799
We will have the upper hand anyway.

156
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,739
Isn't it more enjoyable if you crush her yourself?

157
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:01,480
Isn't it more enjoyable if you crush her yourself?

158
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,219
Well, did you enjoy it?

159
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:07,759
Me? I enjoyed it so much.

160
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,260
I knew it.

161
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,120
The feeling of personally crushing your love rival.

162
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,400
My sister, well done.

163
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,600
Hiding a handsome man in your house, not bad.

164
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,660
I told you a long time ago.

165
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,560
There's a cute guy in my place.

166
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,320
Well, with him bouncing around in front of you every day,

167
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,599
Well, with him bouncing around in front of you every day,

168
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,100
how can your heart not be active?

169
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,420
I only see him as a younger brother.

170
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,720
You know what? The younger brothers nowadays love older sisters.

171
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,120
Because older sisters are generous, gentle, considerate, and caring.

172
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,700
Because older sisters are generous, gentle, considerate, and caring.

173
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,020
But you don't like him, so it doesn't have anything to do with you.

174
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,080
But you don't like him, so it doesn't have anything to do with you.

175
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,520
What do you mean it has nothing to do with me?

176
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,219
He is a younger brother of the new era

177
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:05,260
not the same as your era's understanding.

178
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,044
What are you laughing at?

179
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,020
What are you doing?

180
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,860
You startled me.

181
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,600
This is the soil from our vineyard.

182
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,140
Yes, I figured. I don't know what's different.

183
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,720
Yes, I figured. I don't know what's different.

184
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,539
What about the proposal I mentioned last time?

185
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,160
I haven't decided yet.

186
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,360
Today, we shareholders are having a dividend meeting.

187
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,440
Today, we shareholders are having a dividend meeting.

188
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,519
Why don't you join us?

189
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,600
[Grape Industry Shareholder Cooperative Dividend Meeting]

190
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,380
- Mr. Zhang.
- I'm telling you.

191
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,740
Enough with this spiritual lecture here.

192
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,159
Enough with this spiritual lecture here.

193
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,100
Zhao Linsen, I'm asking you. Why didn't you allow us to pull out those weeds on the edge of the open-air vineyard?

194
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,080
Zhao Linsen, I'm asking you. Why didn't you allow us to pull out those weeds on the edge of the open-air vineyard?

195
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,140
Zhao Linsen, I'm asking you. Why didn't you allow us to pull out those weeds on the edge of the open-air vineyard?

196
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,540
- Right?
- Yeah, totally.

197
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,120
Don't get mad, Mr. Zhang. Sit down first.

198
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,620
Let me explain to you slowly.

199
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,360
Here's the thing.

200
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,480
When you look at other vineyards, don't they all have big sheds?

201
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,920
When you look at other vineyards, don't they all have big sheds?

202
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,580
Don't they all use fertilizers?

203
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,459
Don't they all have to spray agrichemicals to get rid of pests?

204
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,300
Our grapes only have one season a year.

205
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,840
But others have two or three seasons a year.

206
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,720
The grapes they sell, table grapes, the price isn't even half of ours.

207
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
The grapes they sell, table grapes, the price isn't even half of ours.

208
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,400
Our pure natural, organic grapes are more profitable.

209
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,000
Our pure natural, organic grapes are more profitable.

210
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,480
This year's accounts are out, and the dividend increased by 20 percent from last year.

211
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,660
This year's accounts are out, and the dividend increased by 20 percent from last year.

212
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,879
Isn't it a good thing to distribute it?

213
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,339
20? Why not 30 percent?

214
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:29,480
20 percent this year, and 40 next year.

215
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,640
20 percent this year, and 40 next year.

216
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,840
This is very simple. We just trust Sen and follow Sen.

217
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,280
This is very simple. We just trust Sen and follow Sen.

218
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,639
Do whatever Sen says.

219
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,120
Wherever Sen points, we hit.

220
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,840
Right, that's correct.

221
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,840
You're back.

222
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,880
I'm back. What smells so good?

223
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,840
Yes, just wait. I made you a late-night snack.

224
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,280
Yes, just wait. I made you a late-night snack.

225
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,879
I am so lucky to have such a good boyfriend.

226
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,300
I am so lucky to have such a good boyfriend.

227
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,939
Smells good, doesn't it?

228
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:12,700
Then let me tell you.

229
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,759
Come on, have a grape first.

230
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:22,519
I'll have a grape, too. Let me tell you.

231
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,039
If you think your boyfriend is good, treat your boyfriend a little better.

232
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,759
If you think your boyfriend is good, treat your boyfriend a little better.

233
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,300
Because those women outside are eyeing him.

234
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,900
Because those women outside are eyeing him.

235
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,279
My boyfriend, what have you been up to lately? How come there are women again?

236
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,360
My boyfriend, what have you been up to lately? How come there are women again?

237
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,960
My boyfriend, what have you been up to lately? How come there are women again?

238
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,000
Just teasing you. I've been in the vineyard lately.

239
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,440
No wonder you look a little tanned.

240
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,860
You're not going to quit your job and grow grapes, are you?

241
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,459
Even if I wanted to switch fields, I wouldn't take such a big step.

242
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:48,779
Even if I wanted to switch fields, I wouldn't take such a big step.

243
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,079
Recently, I've been getting along with these fruit farmers.

244
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,360
Their attitude toward things inspired me.

245
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,180
Their attitude toward things inspired me.

246
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,968
Wait a minute.

247
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,880
- Does it smell good?
- It does.

248
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,208
Come on.

249
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,199
Keep going.

250
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:13,720
When they're working on something,

251
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,480
they don't necessarily expect a return for their efforts.

252
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,920
they don't necessarily expect a return for their efforts.

253
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,179
- Delicious, right?
- Yep.

254
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:21,360
They just try their best with what's in front of them and what's in their hands.

255
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,639
They just try their best with what's in front of them and what's in their hands.

256
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,760
They just try their best with what's in front of them and what's in their hands.

257
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,780
They can spend three years patiently waiting for one grapevine.

258
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,240
They can spend three years patiently waiting for one grapevine.

259
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,380
How does the saying go?

260
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,120
Often expect and sometimes harvest.

261
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,140
Although our jobs are completely different, I think the mindset is the same. Right?

262
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,019
Although our jobs are completely different, I think the mindset is the same. Right?

263
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:43,039
Although our jobs are completely different, I think the mindset is the same. Right?

264
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,039
Although our jobs are completely different, I think the mindset is the same. Right?

265
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,980
You see, in investment banking, we work diligently on mergers, financing, and IPOs.

266
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,960
You see, in investment banking, we work diligently on mergers, financing, and IPOs.

267
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,520
You see, in investment banking, we work diligently on mergers, financing, and IPOs.

268
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,720
But it's lucky to have one successful project in ten.

269
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,200
But it's lucky to have one successful project in ten.

270
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,259
But seeing their calm attitude,

271
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:58,840
But seeing their calm attitude,

272
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,379
my resentment over failure has dissipated.

273
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,519
my resentment over failure has dissipated.

274
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,720
That's great.

275
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,980
To be honest, during this time, I've been so absorbed in my work that I haven't had time for you.

276
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,540
To be honest, during this time, I've been so absorbed in my work that I haven't had time for you.

277
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,119
To be honest, during this time, I've been so absorbed in my work that I haven't had time for you.

278
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,359
I feel quite guilty.

279
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:12,920
But hearing you talk, I think you've had a good time recently, with so many insights into life.

280
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,740
But hearing you talk, I think you've had a good time recently, with so many insights into life.

281
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,860
But hearing you talk, I think you've had a good time recently, with so many insights into life.

282
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,959
I feel very relieved.

283
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,460
At that time, when Richard was leaving the company to return to his family, honestly, I didn't really get it.

284
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,200
At that time, when Richard was leaving the company to return to his family, honestly, I didn't really get it.

285
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,720
At that time, when Richard was leaving the company to return to his family, honestly, I didn't really get it.

286
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,860
But after this period of experience,

287
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,519
I actually think it's nice to slow down in life.

288
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,620
I actually think it's nice to slow down in life.

289
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,620
People, in different situations, make different choices.

290
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,700
People, in different situations, make different choices.

291
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,780
If one day you suddenly feel tired and want to switch lanes, I will definitely support you.

292
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,620
If one day you suddenly feel tired and want to switch lanes, I will definitely support you.

293
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,400
If one day you suddenly feel tired and want to switch lanes, I will definitely support you.

294
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,320
- I suddenly feel that the things I've been worried about recently don't exist at all.
- What do you mean?

295
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,919
- I suddenly feel that the things I've been worried about recently don't exist at all.
- What do you mean?

296
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,160
- I suddenly feel that the things I've been worried about recently don't exist at all.
- What do you mean?

297
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,920
I was afraid that after I told you, you may not understand this change in my mindset.

298
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,739
I was afraid that after I told you, you may not understand this change in my mindset.

299
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:00,879
Understanding each other between people is inherently difficult.

300
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,280
Understanding each other between people is inherently difficult.

301
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,980
But the most important thing is that I want to understand you.

302
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,259
But the most important thing is that I want to understand you.

303
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,640
This is sincerity.

304
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,500
I like you so much.

305
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,359
I like you so much, too.

306
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:14,739
Could you please help me bring the noodles over?

307
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:16,240
Could you please help me bring the noodles over?

308
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,099
We can watch a movie while eating noodles.

309
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,299
Okay, just this once.

310
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,819
Let's go.

311
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:24,640
Are you feeling better?

312
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,740
I suddenly feel so tired.

313
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,200
Are you still worried about the court thing?

314
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,980
Are you still worried about the court thing?

315
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,900
Actually, you don't need to put too much pressure on yourself.

316
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,400
No matter what the result is, I will support you.

317
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,500
No matter what the result is, I will support you.

318
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,540
This case is a high volume with low return,

319
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,499
and the casework is particularly complex.

320
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,200
So why, why did you take this case in the first place?

321
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,980
So why, why did you take this case in the first place?

322
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:05,696
Do you know?

323
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:09,100
When those authors came to me, they were very young.

324
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,980
When those authors came to me, they were very young.

325
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,620
They were all young girls, holding my hand, crying, and telling me

326
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,919
They were all young girls, holding my hand, crying, and telling me

327
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,620
how sad they were when their works were plagiarized.

328
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,360
how sad they were when their works were plagiarized.

329
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,640
I felt sorry for them.

330
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,100
But when they talked about their works, their eyes were glowing.

331
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,719
But when they talked about their works, their eyes were glowing.

332
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:30,599
At that moment, I really felt...

333
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,800
that they had power.

334
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,399
I feel that if I could do something to help them,

335
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,319
I feel that if I could do something to help them,

336
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:42,120
it seems that I can also find my own value.

337
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,320
I think you've lost weight from working

338
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,700
I think you've lost weight from working

339
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,740
and haven't slept well recently.

340
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,259
But if this thing gives you energy and passion,

341
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:56,819
But if this thing gives you energy and passion,

342
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:59,000
But if this thing gives you energy and passion,

343
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,420
then I think you should persist without looking back.

344
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,839
Cheer up, and prepare well. You can do it.

345
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,899
Have you ever heard of a saying?

346
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:27,140
What we do is actually not much different from real estate agents.

347
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,740
What we do is actually not much different from real estate agents.

348
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,760
Did you know that after Ma Weiwei was laid off,

349
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,240
he went to sell houses and did really well.

350
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,699
In less than two months, he became the sales champion.

351
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,360
I heard about it.

352
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,500
Actually, selling houses is packaging a house into a lifestyle,

353
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,800
and selling it to someone who suits it.

354
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,059
The achievement in our line of work

355
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,760
is not how much money we make or how many projects we do,

356
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,660
is not how much money we make or how many projects we do,

357
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,420
but finding the right sheath for the right knife.

358
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,500
So you mean selling Mr. Zhao's vineyard to Lei?

359
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,800
So you mean selling Mr. Zhao's vineyard to Lei?

360
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,340
They both love their industries, but one lacks high-quality grapes,

361
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,620
They both love their industries, but one lacks high-quality grapes,

362
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,820
and the other lacks the production chain to turn grapes into wine.

363
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,100
Isn't it a win-win when the two are combined?

364
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,520
Did you pack everything?

365
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,800
Don't leave something behind in a hurry.

366
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,420
I am packing.

367
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,600
Evidence list, complaint, evidence, agency document,

368
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,800
Evidence list, complaint, evidence, agency document,

369
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,319
and cross-examination opinion.

370
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,039
Tang Ying, are you nervous?

371
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,160
Tang Ying, are you nervous?

372
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,580
I see you've been muttering.

373
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,400
What? First time in court?

374
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,160
Don't be anxious about things that haven't happened yet.

375
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,200
You have come this far, overcoming all obstacles.

376
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,839
You have to believe you are the best.

377
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,340
Do you know how anxious I am right now?

378
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,480
When I get nervous, I tend to talk a lot and get flustered.

379
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,680
When I get nervous, I tend to talk a lot and get flustered.

380
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,060
Will the judge have an opinion of me?

381
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:51,919
What if I need to go to the bathroom?

382
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,179
What if the other lawyer is really good?

383
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,520
I'm done. I'm surely going to lose.

384
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,559
If I lose the case, won't it be a disgrace?

385
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,920
If I lose the case, won't it be a disgrace?

386
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,960
Maybe, I can teach you a secret.

387
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,200
Speak quickly.

388
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,160
Before I go into the courtroom, I used to stand in front of the mirror, and tell myself,

389
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,200
Before I go into the courtroom, I used to stand in front of the mirror, and tell myself,

390
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
Before I go into the courtroom, I used to stand in front of the mirror, and tell myself,

391
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,520
"You, Wang Yusu, are the world's best lawyer, no need for the prefix 'female'."

392
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,920
"You, Wang Yusu, are the world's best lawyer, no need for the prefix 'female'."

393
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,600
"You, Wang Yusu, are the world's best lawyer, no need for the prefix 'female'."

394
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,440
Then I'd pinch myself hard to remember this sober feeling.

395
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,380
Then I'd pinch myself hard to remember this sober feeling.

396
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,680
When I'm in court, if I ever feel panicky and start to sweat,

397
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,759
When I'm in court, if I ever feel panicky and start to sweat,

398
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,960
I would pinch myself again to remind myself that Wang Yusu is the best lawyer.

399
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,699
I would pinch myself again to remind myself that Wang Yusu is the best lawyer.

400
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:24,419
I would pinch myself again to remind myself that Wang Yusu is the best lawyer.

401
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,200
You also get nervous and sweat?

402
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Of course.

403
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,519
You have no idea. Your leader here used to handle criminal cases.

404
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:35,739
You have no idea. Your leader here used to handle criminal cases.

405
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,504
Shut up.

406
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,480
I'll let you get ready.

407
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,519
When you're tired, you can come to Lhasa to visit us.

408
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,960
When you're tired, you can come to Lhasa to visit us.

409
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,700
I heard the yak meat hotpot there is really good.

410
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,719
Why? I'm not going away forever.

411
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,620
All right, I'll wait for your return.

412
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,659
All right, I'm leaving.

413
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
Let's go.

414
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,179
Running away.

415
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,460
You got this.

416
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,920
Be good to her.

417
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,560
I will.

418
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,032
- Old Zhao!
- Ziquan is here.

419
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:08,736
- Old Zhao!
- Ziquan is here.

420
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,940
Let me introduce you.

421
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,579
This is Brother Shan.

422
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:15,980
This is Zhao Linsen, Mr. Zhao.

423
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,419
- Pleasure, Zhao Linsen.
- Hello.

424
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:18,820
This is his younger brother, Brother Lei.

425
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,220
Hello, I'm Zhao Linsen.

426
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,140
Thank you for making the long trip here.

427
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,096
Mr. Zhao will give you a tour.

428
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,559
All right, let's go have a look.

429
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,900
All right.

430
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,120
My vineyard is a little different from others.

431
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,960
My vineyard is a little different from others.

432
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,160
All the varieties we grow are bred by ourselves.

433
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,340
All the varieties we grow are bred by ourselves.

434
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,559
The Riesling over there, the Chardonnay here, and the Cabernet Sauvignon there

435
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,680
The Riesling over there, the Chardonnay here, and the Cabernet Sauvignon there

436
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,080
are all breeds we've cultivated for three to four years.

437
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,100
All for making natural, organic wine.

438
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,960
All for making natural, organic wine.

439
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,079
- Natural wine?
- Natural wine.

440
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,940
It's a very popular category of wine in Europe.

441
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,640
It's actually just wine, without any additives.

442
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,900
It's actually just wine, without any additives.

443
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,340
One drawback is that the shelf life will be a bit shorter,

444
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,760
but the taste is very pure, and the flavor is very special.

445
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,960
but the taste is very pure, and the flavor is very special.

446
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,199
Purely natural.

447
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:56,320
I get it.

448
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,119
So what he's talking about is red wine. Right?

449
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,559
If we were to talk about Chinese wine, it means this wine hasn't been blended. Right?

450
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,920
If we were to talk about Chinese wine, it means this wine hasn't been blended. Right?

451
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,960
That's right.

452
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,860
- Pure grain.
- Exactly.

453
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,079
There's more over there. Let's go.

454
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,200
Let's go and have a look.

455
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:16,000
Let's go. You're the best.

456
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,979
Let's go. You're the strongest.

457
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:24,180
All right, all right. Okay.

458
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:27,299
I'm leaving.

459
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,620
Hold on, hold on! Wait!

460
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,340
Here, take this for the road.

461
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,840
Why does it feel like sending a child off to the college entrance exam?

462
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,820
You're not my father.

463
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,700
To be honest, I'm really nervous.

464
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,380
After Mao Mao's case ended, I felt relieved.

465
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,279
I didn't expect the boss of Shi Zhi Literature City to give me this case.

466
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,960
I didn't expect the boss of Shi Zhi Literature City to give me this case.

467
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,100
He trusts me so much, but I always feel I'm not worthy.

468
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,459
He trusts me so much, but I always feel I'm not worthy.

469
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,300
If you're not worthy, who is?

470
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,919
This is what you earned with hard work. Okay?

471
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,960
The fried dough stick, bought.

472
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,559
The eggs, boiled by me.

473
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,800
One fried dough stick and two eggs.

474
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,900
You'll score a hundred points.

475
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,752
Miss Ada.

476
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,339
Do you have a minute?

477
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,400
Miss Ada, latte.

478
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,016
Thank you.

479
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,559
If I'm not mistaken,

480
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,319
it's the first time you've invited me for a coffee. Isn't that so?

481
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,808
Indeed.

482
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,419
Richard's departure has had a big impact on you.

483
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:43,620
Richard's departure has had a big impact on you.

484
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,440
Richard has told me many of your stories.

485
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,380
Richard has told me many of your stories.

486
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,580
He does regret it quite a bit.

487
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,200
It's all in the past. Why bring it up again?

488
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah.

489
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,620
But from you guys, I really did learn a lot.

490
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,000
But from you guys, I really did learn a lot.

491
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
To be precise, it should be mutual learning.

492
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,260
Actually, Miss Ada, the reason why I invited you for a coffee

493
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,519
Actually, Miss Ada, the reason why I invited you for a coffee

494
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,100
is because I wanted to talk with you and see if we can collaborate.

495
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,920
is because I wanted to talk with you and see if we can collaborate.

496
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,720
At the moment, I have two projects in progress.

497
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,039
If I understood correctly,

498
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,619
you're referring to the project you resurrected from the old industrial area

499
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:21,699
and the Aroma project. Right?

500
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:23,559
Yes, before Richard left,

501
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:27,120
he handed me a vineyard business.

502
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,160
I was wondering if I could combine it with a wine brand

503
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,300
I was wondering if I could combine it with a wine brand

504
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,739
from the old industrial area.

505
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,880
You are well experienced,

506
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,220
and your achievements are well-recognized in the industry.

507
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,220
and your achievements are well-recognized in the industry.

508
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,699
If you were to endorse us,

509
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:42,920
I believe they would trust us even more.

510
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,879
I believe they would trust us even more.

511
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:48,319
So, are you interested?

512
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,540
Since you've put it like that,

513
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,740
let's toast with coffee, to a pleasant cooperation.

514
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,608
Pleasant cooperation.

515
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,180
♫ We're looking for satisfaction ♫

516
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,590
♫ With all the chain reaction ♫

517
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:10,720
♫ And the world is spinning round and round, in the fast lane ♫

518
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,770
♫ All days ♫

519
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,120
♫ All you have ♫

520
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,070
♫ Go on to turn around ♫

521
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:34,599
Cheers.

522
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,240
Mr. Xie, here you go.

523
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,140
Okay, thank you.

524
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,400
Where's Tang Ying?

525
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,820
- Over there.
- Miss Tang.

526
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,820
Miss Tang, why does the heroine look so dispirited?

527
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,519
Miss Tang, why does the heroine look so dispirited?

528
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,599
Come on, say a few words to everyone.

529
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,019
Great! Give us a toast.

530
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,780
Thank you, Shi Zhi Literature City, for choosing us.

531
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,820
Thank you, Mr. Xie, for trusting us.

532
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,120
I've always dreamed of this day,

533
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,720
but it came too quickly.

534
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,280
I have to rewrite my five-year plan.

535
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,880
I know winning this lawsuit is just the first step.

536
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,519
The road ahead is long and arduous,

537
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,360
and I need everyone's joint efforts

538
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,960
so that we can make a contribution

539
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
to improve our intellectual property protection system.

540
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,879
to improve our intellectual property protection system.

541
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:15,640
- Thank you, everyone.
- All right.

542
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,472
- Thank you, everyone.
- All right.

543
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,700
We can't drink during work time.

544
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,720
So let's toast with soft drinks. Okay?

545
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,519
Come on, congratulations to Miss Tang Ying.

546
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:26,079
Congratulations, Tang Ying.

547
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,519
Congratulations, Miss Tang.

548
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:28,599
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

549
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,640
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

550
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,480
Miss Tang,

551
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,839
it's a good day today,

552
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,419
but why do you seem a bit down?

553
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:48,720
I... I don't know.

554
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,459
I think I should be very happy,

555
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:53,200
as I've always longed for this day.

556
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,820
But now that it's here,

557
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,019
I really don't know what I want.

558
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:27,019
I will open the curtains. Okay?

559
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:28,704
Go ahead.

560
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,400
What are you doing?

561
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,888
What's wrong?

562
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Tang Ying?

563
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,939
Tang Ying, what's wrong?

564
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:02,019
What's wrong with your ears?

565
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,599
Tang Ying, can you hear me?

566
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,860
Wait for me here.

567
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,600
I'll go to registration.

568
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,700
Hello, I want to register for otolaryngology.

569
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,180
Okay, please pay here.

570
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,960
Scan this. Right?

571
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,119
I can finally take a break.

572
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,780
But even in the hospital,

573
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,820
I still feel a strong sense of guilt.

574
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,899
Upstairs, right? Do I turn left or right on the second floor?

575
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:40,992
Let's go.

576
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,620
From the moment I stepped into the workplace,

577
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,060
I have always tried my best.

578
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,739
I have thought about not fighting so hard,

579
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:05,319
but I'm afraid of being replaced,

580
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,179
afraid that I can't keep up with others,

581
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:11,960
and afraid that one moment of carelessness will lead to a big fall.

582
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,340
In the end, I did indeed become a better employee,

583
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,699
but I failed in life.

584
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:34,220
Hey, Mu.

585
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,340
Boss, everyone is waiting here. And I'm all alone.

586
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,620
Boss, everyone is waiting here. And I'm all alone.

587
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,520
When are you coming?

588
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,539
I can't make it now. Can you cover for me?

589
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,820
Can I handle it?

590
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,720
You can. Believe in yourself.

591
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,179
I have to go. Cover for me.

592
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,632
How is it, Doctor?

593
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,759
Take a look here.

594
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,040
The line for a normal person looks like this.

595
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,639
But her left ear's line is like this.

596
00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:11,800
How is her mood usually?

597
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,060
Is she a bit anxious and under a lot of stress?

598
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,440
She's been quite busy recently.

599
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,660
Maybe she hasn't been getting enough rest.

600
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,739
Well, let's try some hormone injections.

601
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:22,179
She should recover quickly.

602
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:24,799
All right. Could you write a prescription? I'll go pay.

603
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,368
Okay.

604
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,099
I think it's time to slow down a bit.

605
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,860
[Cleaning up......]

606
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,499
Congratulations, your hearing has recovered.

607
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:23,580
But, doctor, when I try to hear,

608
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,680
there still seems to be a barrier in my left ear.

609
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,940
there still seems to be a barrier in my left ear.

610
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,360
It takes time to make a full recovery.

611
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,599
You must reduce stress and avoid staying up late.

612
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,579
Slowly, it will get better.

613
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,319
Looking at your previous conditions,

614
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,000
whether it was your wisdom teeth or a breast lump,

615
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,499
they were all warnings from your body.

616
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:42,660
But you ignored them.

617
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,440
Well, this time it's right in your ear, beating the drum. Right?

618
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,860
Well, this time it's right in your ear, beating the drum. Right?

619
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,039
I never thought that the drumbeat would be so loud

620
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,440
I never thought that the drumbeat would be so loud

621
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,920
that I'd actually become deaf.

622
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,712
Let's sit for a while.

623
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,440
So, remember, health comes first. Okay?

624
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,160
So, remember, health comes first. Okay?

625
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,119
But I really never thought I could recover this quickly.

626
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,100
But I really never thought I could recover this quickly.

627
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,340
I thought I'd have to...

628
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,559
bother you for another month or so.

629
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,840
No problem.

630
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,790
A month, a year…

631
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,270
It's all fine.

632
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,820
Don't think I couldn't tell

633
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,580
that you swallowed the word "lifetime".

634
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,219
I'm afraid you'll think I'm too sappy.

635
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:30,100
Indeed, many people like to promise a lifetime.

636
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,240
There will always be someone saying, "I will always be good to you,"

637
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,319
There will always be someone saying, "I will always be good to you,"

638
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:34,480
"I will always love you," or "I will always take care of you."

639
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,960
But in fact, words and actions

640
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,380
are completely different things.

641
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,460
So, have I passed the test?

642
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,019
So, have I passed the test?

643
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:45,100
Who knows? A lifetime is still so long.

644
00:31:49,304 --> 00:31:49,940
- Mr. Zheng.
- Come in.

645
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,440
- Mr. Zheng.
- Come in.

646
00:31:52,696 --> 00:31:54,400
Why are you back?

647
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,240
I saw the doctor, and they said I'm fine.

648
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,759
Sit, sit. If you're not fully recovered,

649
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,860
you can rest for a few more days.

650
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,679
I've rested so much these days that I've almost rusted.

651
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:05,839
I should get back to work.

652
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,240
You're still the same.

653
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,540
With a strong character, you can't sit still.

654
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,259
None of the interns who came with you

655
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:15,000
made it to the end.

656
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,120
Tang, actually,

657
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,119
maybe in a few years, you'll become a Senior Partner.

658
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,500
maybe in a few years, you'll become a Senior Partner.

659
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,000
Mr. Zheng, don't flatter me.

660
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,460
I could get carried away.

661
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,380
Of course, you also need to be vigilant.

662
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,319
The higher you stand, the greater the resistance you face.

663
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:31,520
The higher you stand, the greater the resistance you face.

664
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,219
Actually, I wanted to formally talk to you about this.

665
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:38,419
Actually, I wanted to formally talk to you about this.

666
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:40,979
I want to transfer some of the long-term clients to Miss Han.

667
00:32:40,979 --> 00:32:43,079
I want to transfer some of the long-term clients to Miss Han.

668
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:45,920
Before, I always felt I had to work hard.

669
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,300
Before, I always felt I had to work hard.

670
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,140
Only by working hard,

671
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,240
could I possibly have a chance for a future

672
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,459
could I possibly have a chance for a future

673
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:55,960
and for a better life.

674
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,100
But this time,

675
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,079
when I fell sick and couldn't hear,

676
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,119
I realized...

677
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,060
that I did work hard, but I lost my life.

678
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,280
that I did work hard, but I lost my life.

679
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,520
So, I don't want to live like I used to,

680
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,720
being pressed by work until I can't breathe.

681
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,520
I want to slow down.

682
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,279
I hope you can understand, Mr. Zheng.

683
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,839
I really get it.

684
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,050
It's not easy.

685
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,440
But perhaps this way,

686
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,519
the days of being a Senior Partner are getting further and further away.

687
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,380
the days of being a Senior Partner are getting further and further away.

688
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,159
The young people nowadays are not easy to manage.

689
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,100
By the way, we have a round of intern interviews tomorrow.

690
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,100
By the way, we have a round of intern interviews tomorrow.

691
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,900
You can join HR and help pick

692
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,399
You can join HR and help pick

693
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,800
an efficient one for yourself.

694
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,320
- Ziyao.
- Miss Han.

695
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,519
- Ziyao.
- Miss Han.

696
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,359
Why are there so many loopholes in the terms for Party A?

697
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:05,319
Why are there so many loopholes in the terms for Party A?

698
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,280
Yes, I marked them all.

699
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,600
I've arranged a meeting at their company tomorrow morning.

700
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,880
Prepare the specifics and arguments,

701
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,499
and we'll meet there tomorrow.

702
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:16,680
Am I going, too?

703
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,199
Of course.

704
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,200
What should I wear, Miss Han?

705
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,000
What you're wearing is fine.

706
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Our profession doesn't need to be displayed through clothes.

707
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,552
Okay.

708
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,360
Miss Tang, the interns are here for the interview.

709
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,460
There are more today. A total of seven people.

710
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,760
These are the resumes.

711
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,940
Okay, I'll be there in a while.

712
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,424
Waiting for you.

713
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,360
Miss Tang, Miss Han is buying afternoon tea.

714
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,559
Do you want cake or salad?

715
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:48,599
Either is fine, but I probably won't have an afternoon.

716
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,920
There are seven people for the interview today,

717
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,440
- I'll go there first.
- We'll save it for you.

718
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,559
Okay.

719
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,199
You're back so soon.

720
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,440
Long time no see, Guo Yu.

721
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,760
I heard you were unwell.

722
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,599
How are you feeling now?

723
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,240
I'm all good. Thanks for your concern.

724
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,039
No problem, Mr. Zheng said you were short of people.

725
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:06,760
I'm available.

726
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,520
I thought you were doing great in your team.

727
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,599
Yes, but it's really tiring.

728
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:13,360
I want to be in charge of some cases, so…

729
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,559
It's not easy here either.

730
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,800
Look. The young people now are quite amazing.

731
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,080
Masters, Ph.D.s, Law Masters, Law Ph.D.s,

732
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,560
those are all basics.

733
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,660
When you think about it,

734
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,180
our threshold was quite low back then.

735
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:25,920
- I'm going in first.
- Okay, go ahead.

736
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,340
- I'm going in first.
- Okay, go ahead.

737
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,720
Xia Tian, I'll come find you again tomorrow.

738
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,456
Okay.

739
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,536
Lin Xinzi?

740
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,020
Lin Xinzi, are you back?

741
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,728
Lin Xinzi?

742
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,619
I know you're back. I'm coming in.

743
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,620
Have you eaten yet? Let's go eat.

744
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,168
No.

745
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,300
What happened to you?

746
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,800
What do you mean "What happened"?

747
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,960
What happened to me is none of your business.

748
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,619
You're being weird.

749
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,379
I'm being weird?

750
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:15,860
♫ After several sleepless nights, only then was I willing to let the fever down ♫

751
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,679
♫ I can't love, but I can't walk away either ♫

752
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,800
Who is it?

753
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,939
It's me, Xia Tian.

754
00:37:40,939 --> 00:37:43,480
The door is unlocked. Just come in.

755
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,559
Scared, huh?

756
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,384
It's okay.

757
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,200
All right, all right. I'm sorry.

758
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,300
All right, I'm just messing with you.

759
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,519
It's scary enough to have a power outage at midnight.

760
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:06,780
It's scary enough to have a power outage at midnight.

761
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,840
Our power was cut off because we didn't pay the bill.

762
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,432
I've already paid it.

763
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,920
What are you doing?

764
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,039
Accompanying you. Aren't you scared?

765
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,480
Xia Tian.

766
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:41,800
Who was the girl that came to our house this afternoon?

767
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,600
What girl?

768
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,208
Well…

769
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,840
I remember. She was introduced by a friend

770
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,079
to form a band with me.

771
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,719
I interviewed her,

772
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,219
but I don't think I will hire her.

773
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,600
Do you like her?

774
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,599
No way.

775
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,000
She's not my type at all.

776
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,760
So, you were angry at me this afternoon

777
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,700
because of this girl?

778
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,024
No way.

779
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,359
I knew it.

780
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,880
I came over here so happily to invite you to dinner,

781
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,960
I came over here so happily to invite you to dinner,

782
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,339
and you gave me the cold shoulder.

783
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:34,140
And you slammed the door.

784
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,519
You even said I was weird.

785
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:39,900
Okay, it's my fault.

786
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,440
But if there's anything in the future, you can ask me directly.

787
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
But if there's anything in the future, you can ask me directly.

788
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,119
I won't hide things from you.

789
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,464
Then…

790
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,119
Why have you been playing Jay Chou's songs at home these days?

791
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,260
Why have you been playing Jay Chou's songs at home these days?

792
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:01,536
Because you like them.

793
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,880
Do you…have a hotspot?

794
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,900
Do you… have a hotspot?

795
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,280
I've run out of data, and there's no Wi-Fi.

796
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,064
I'll turn it on for you.

797
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:34,016
Try it.

798
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,180
All good?

799
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:23,079
What's the matter?

800
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:25,719
Nothing. There was a bug.

801
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,959
Your name is Xia Tian, which means summer,

802
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:33,419
so you attract all kinds of bugs.

803
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:35,939
Is that so?

804
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:55,730
♫ Together we will chase dreams into the sky ♫

805
00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:00,280
♫ With love as our guide we'll soar and fly ♫

806
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,220
♫ In your love's embrace I've found my bliss ♫

807
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,160
Lin Xinzi, you're really boring—

808
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:17,480
♫ Together we will write our symphony ♫

809
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,740
♫ With every breath, I'm enchanted anew ♫

810
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:27,100
♫ Wrapped in your arms in this magical room ♫

811
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,700
♫ Just you and me ♫

812
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,459
Why did you suddenly bring me here?

813
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,460
I wanted to tell you something.

814
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,979
Why did we have to come here?

815
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,059
Don't say anything. Let me guess.

816
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:46,679
Are you going to become Mr. Zhao's chief financial officer?

817
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:49,800
Are you going to become Mr. Zhao's chief financial officer?

818
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,260
Well, I refused Mr. Zhao's offer.

819
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,432
Why?

820
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,619
I thought you two had always been

821
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:04,600
aligned in your ideas.

822
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,339
True, but…

823
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:10,059
Is it because I was sick?

824
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:12,920
No, how could it be because of you?

825
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:16,939
I thought about it, and actually, I'm tired of this industry.

826
00:43:16,939 --> 00:43:19,239
I thought about it, and actually, I'm tired of this industry.

827
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:21,440
But if I start a business with Mr. Zhao, would that be what I want?

828
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,839
But if I start a business with Mr. Zhao, would that be what I want?

829
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:25,700
The grass is always greener on the other side.

830
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,819
What if one day I miss my suit and leather shoes?

831
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:30,419
What if one day I miss my suit and leather shoes?

832
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,140
Anyway, whatever decision you make,

833
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,599
I'll support it.

834
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:37,599
As long as you're not giving up what you like for me.

835
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,260
As long as you're not giving up what you like for me.

836
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,220
But, Xu Ziquan,

837
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,440
you've never told me that you loved me.

838
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:50,000
Maybe I think love is not a noun, it's a verb.

839
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,419
Maybe I think love is not a noun, it's a verb.

840
00:43:53,419 --> 00:43:54,840
So I think it can only be expressed through actions.

841
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,580
So I think it can only be expressed through actions.

842
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,120
You're good with words.

843
00:44:02,508 --> 00:44:03,800
Give me the ring.

844
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,199
Why?

845
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,832
Just give it to me.

846
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:12,880
I've never believed that there was such a thing as the "one" in this world.

847
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,400
I've never believed that there was such a thing as the "one" in this world.

848
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,400
Think about it. In this world, there are several billion people.

849
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,540
Think about it. In this world, there are several billion people.

850
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,160
So for me, you're just one of them.

851
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,459
So for me, you're just one of them.

852
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,820
Our meeting was a coincidence,

853
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,220
but we've been through so much together.

854
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,300
We understand each other,

855
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,220
and we've changed for each other.

856
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,599
So in this process, we are slowly

857
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:41,840
So in this process, we are slowly

858
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,660
becoming "the one" for each other.

859
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,260
Right?

860
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:56,780
So, romance is not about encounters.

861
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,879
It's about us.

862
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,984
Tang Ying,

863
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:03,939
falling in love with you is a continuous process.

864
00:45:03,939 --> 00:45:08,020
falling in love with you is a continuous process.

865
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,170
So...

866
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,660
will you marry me?

867
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:21,740
Xu Ziquan.

868
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,400
- You bastard!
- What?

869
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,879
What are you doing?

870
00:45:24,879 --> 00:45:25,880
How can you do this?

871
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,140
You're being all romantic and saying all this,

872
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,700
but you're sending me off with this friendship ring.

873
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,220
It's been used three times, bro.

874
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,260
Are you angry?

875
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,139
Of course, I'm angry.

876
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:38,280
Can you tell?

877
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,800
This is what we call the economic mind of an investment banker, you know?

878
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,579
What economic mind? All I see is that you're stingy.

879
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:43,880
Why are you so stingy?

880
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,360
If you put half the enthusiasm you have for cars on me,

881
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,360
I wouldn't only have a friendship ring.

882
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,259
I wouldn't only have a friendship ring.

883
00:45:49,259 --> 00:45:50,680
How could it be?

884
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,920
It's here. Look.

885
00:45:58,519 --> 00:45:59,800
That's more like it.

886
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,280
- Open it and look.
- Really.

887
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,768
Where's the ring?

888
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,159
When did you come up here?

889
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:08,679
No, before we came up, I asked the waiter to put it here.

890
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:10,460
No, before we came up, I asked the waiter to put it here.

891
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,820
My God, you're so careless.

892
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,119
It's such a valuable thing,

893
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,350
but you let them put it here.

894
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,900
Xu…

895
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,040
How could I lose it?

896
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,720
♫ Suddenly I want to be your Michelle, Mandy, Brandy, Barbara Ann ♫

897
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,490
Will you marry me?

898
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:31,840
♫ Sometimes love is temporary, lost inside a wishing well ♫

899
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,800
I always thought you were...

900
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,320
♫ This one's like a fairy tale, as far as I can tell ♫

901
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,340
...reluctant to the idea of marriage.

902
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,999
Before I met you, I was indeed reluctant.

903
00:46:46,059 --> 00:46:48,219
But after meeting you,

904
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,780
all I want is you,

905
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:54,480
in whatever way.

906
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:58,119
I know when we step into marriage,

907
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:01,140
we will face a lot of problems.

908
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,999
But because it's you,

909
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:10,340
I believe… I believe we can…

910
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,280
I believe we can solve any problem.

911
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,280
I also believe that we can live our lives

912
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,300
I also believe that we can live our lives

913
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,800
in ways that we both want.

914
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,100
♫ I want to be the one that makes you feel that way, feel that way ♫

915
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:23,890
Tang Ying,

916
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,240
do you want to build a world

917
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,600
do you want to build a world

918
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:34,079
that belongs to us?

919
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:39,830
♫ Make you want to stay forever, nothing I can't get you through ♫

920
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,190
♫ Scream and shout it from the roof,
I want to hear it loud and true ♫

921
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:46,570
I... do.

922
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:51,290
♫ Write a song for me, I wanna be the one
that makes you feel that way ♫

923
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:55,930
♫ Feel that way, feel that way, the one that makes you feel ♫

924
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,480
♫ Write a song for me, I wanna be the one
that makes you feel that way ♫

925
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,410
♫ Feel that way, feel that way, the one that makes you feel ♫

926
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,490
Matryoshka dolls?

927
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:09,940
♫ Write a song for me, I wanna be the one
that makes you feel that way ♫

928
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:14,520
♫ Feel that way, feel that way, the one that makes you feel ♫

929
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,160
♫ Write a song for me, I wanna be the one
that makes you feel that way ♫

930
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,470
♫ Feel that way, feel that way, the one that makes you feel ♫

931
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:29,180
I'm scared.

932
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,160
I'm going to faint.

933
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:33,840
My god.

934
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,079
A brother is a brother for a reason.

935
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,000
His proposal trick was outstanding.

936
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,960
You two are too sweet.

937
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,880
Stop flashing. It's blinding me.

938
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,640
Look at the contrast between yours and mine.

939
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,480
How did that younger brother confess to you?

940
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,900
Him?

941
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,579
He said, "You don't have a boyfriend,

942
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:55,879
and I don't have a girlfriend.

943
00:48:55,879 --> 00:48:58,020
So why don't we try being together?"

944
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,000
And then?

945
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,080
Then we got together.

946
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,759
That's it?

947
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:10,740
No more forms and tests?

948
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,880
Don't mention it.

949
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:14,600
I know.

950
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,840
He's not a qualified marriage partner.

951
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,960
He's not a qualified marriage partner.

952
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,460
He's young, he doesn't have a car or a house,

953
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,180
and he's in this industry where he

954
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,939
hasn't made a name for himself yet.

955
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,220
Although he's not a good destination,

956
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:33,679
I don't want to think too much.

957
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,080
I just want…

958
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,840
I don't want to just find someone who likes me,

959
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,539
I don't want to just find someone who likes me,

960
00:49:40,539 --> 00:49:42,540
but someone I like.

961
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:46,220
No, someone with mutual liking. We like each other.

962
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:53,639
Look how handsome he looks when he sings.

963
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:55,500
He is quite handsome.

964
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,400
But you know what,

965
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,719
the most important thing is that I feel

966
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:04,860
especially at ease when I'm with him.

967
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,279
Have you thought about your future?

968
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:13,640
No. Why think so much?

969
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,559
Now, I just simply think

970
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,960
living in the moment and being happy are the most important.

971
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,699
Choosing what you like is the most important.

972
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,860
Great. We both found what we wanted.

973
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,839
As long as we're happy. Come on.

974
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:30,360
As long as we're happy.

975
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,300
Sweet, huh?

976
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,440
Can I ask how much this diamond ring is?

977
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,800
Can I ask how much this diamond ring is?

978
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,780
How can I tell you?

979
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,260
Can my good sister buy me one?

980
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,400
Of course not.

981
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,932
I'll buy one for you.

982
00:50:42,932 --> 00:50:44,640
Listen to his nonsense.

983
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,240
All right. How will you guys go back?

984
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,840
I've called for a luxury cab. I can give you a ride.

985
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,260
Let's ride bikes back.

986
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,920
Okay.

987
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,776
Don't disturb our alone time. So romantic.

988
00:50:54,776 --> 00:50:55,679
Don't disturb our alone time. So romantic.

989
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:57,719
My daughter is going to get married. I can't bear it.

990
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:00,599
What daughter? You make me sound so old.

991
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,640
Be careful.

992
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,820
Daughter.

993
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,400
What did you call me the last time you were at my house?

994
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,199
Fine, hurry up and go. Be careful on the road.

995
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:07,400
Okay, okay.

996
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,159
Don't worry. Goodbye.

997
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:11,260
Goodbye.

998
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,400

00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,159
of the Chinese shareholders.

1034
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:22,131
Okay, got it.

1035
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:25,173
♫ Who guessed the right time ♫

1036
00:53:25,173 --> 00:53:28,839
♫ Without a deadline ♫

1037
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:33,989
♫ Every day with you ♫

1038
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:36,764
♫  Is so special ♫

1039
00:53:36,764 --> 00:53:42,079
♫ No longer afraid to face the midnight alone ♫

1040
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:43,552
Goodbye.

1041
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,860
Really, my brain cells are going to explode today.

1042
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,632
I'm sorry.

1043
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:51,740
I see you've been cleaning for a while.

1044
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,360
I... I've just been too busy today.

1045
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,679
- Hungry?
- Starving, you know?

1046
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:58,640
All I had today was McDonald's,

1047
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,839
and the rest were all kinds of snacks.

1048
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:02,780
Let's go eat.

1049
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,240
To eat?

1050
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,100
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1051
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,159
This is the best wonton in Beijing.

1052
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:13,020
Do you remember our first meal

1053
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,640
was at this wonton stand?

1054
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,419
It was very much like today, with clear and refreshing autumn air.

1055
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,560
How could I not remember?

1056
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,800
You were going to represent all women

1057
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,500
and boycott me, a playboy who loves everyone everywhere.

1058
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,719
You were drunk and took me to buy a ring.

1059
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:30,519
I really thought you must have a hundred rings in your house.

1060
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:31,960
I really thought you must have a hundred rings in your house.

1061
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,099
Did you find them? Where are they? A hundred?

1062
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:36,599
I told you and you didn't believe it.

1063
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:39,240
It was my first time buying a ring for a girl,

1064
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,600
and someone I'd only met a few times.

1065
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,360
So, true love is utterly unreasonable.

1066
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,920
Where should we go later?

1067
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,519
I know a whiskey bar. It's quite stylish.

1068
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:50,819
I know a whiskey bar. It's quite stylish.

1069
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:51,920
Okay.

1070
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,399
I happened to go on a business trip to England before,

1071
00:54:54,399 --> 00:54:56,860
and the local colleagues took me to many distilleries.

1072
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,760
I can see if this place is authentic.

1073
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,679
What kind of whiskey do you think suits me?

1074
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:06,579
Allen, eighteen years.

1075
00:55:06,579 --> 00:55:10,660
The feeling of vanilla and tannins can suddenly explode in your mouth.

1076
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,180
The aftertaste also carries a hint of tropical fruit fragrance.

1077
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,999
- Cola from 2023 suits you better.
- Thank you.

1078
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:17,860
- Cola from 2023 suits you better.
- Thank you.

1079
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,180
So this belongs to me, right?

1080
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,340
Of course.

1081
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,740
- It's mine then, right?
- Of course.

1082
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,200
Did I ever tell you what I especially like about you?

1083
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,059
Did I ever tell you what I especially like about you?

1084
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:30,519
You love to pretend.

1085
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,880
Did you think I was particularly vain the first time you saw me?

1086
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,839
Did you think I was particularly vain the first time you saw me?

1087
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,919
When I first saw you,

1088
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,979
I thought you were like a tough weed,

1089
00:55:43,979 --> 00:55:45,239
despite the time and place

1090
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:46,740
despite the time and place

1091
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,620
you can keep your fragile self standing strong.

1092
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,680
you can keep your fragile self standing strong.

1093
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,088
Of course.

1094
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:58,240
I also know you tried to latch onto a rich man.

1095
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,200
Sure, I was latching onto a rich man.

1096
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,940
But there was nothing between us.

1097
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,260
And I didn't like him, not at all.

1098
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,740
Don't get jealous for no reason.

1099
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,059
I know, I'm not jealous.

1100
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:13,519
I just think you're a bit silly.

1101
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:15,980
How am I silly? Speak properly.

1102
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,200
Is it amazing to be rich or to be old?

1103
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,440
How could you bypass an elite gentleman like me

1104
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,220
and choose to like him?

1105
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,419
What's up with that? I'm not bad either.

1106
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:32,320
So you're saying, you had feelings for me a long time ago. Right?

1107
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,860
No, definitely not.

1108
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,440
Just the concern of a regular friend.

1109
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,480
Let me tell you.

1110
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,480
At that time, I too had swarms of girls around, waiting to take care of me.

1111
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,079
At that time, I too had swarms of girls around, waiting to take care of me.

1112
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,120
Xu Ziquan, you really love to pretend.

1113
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,719
Xu Ziquan, you really love to pretend.

1114
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:48,239
So, the two of us are meant for each other. Right?

1115
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:50,800
So, the two of us are meant for each other. Right?

1116
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,900
Get over yourself.

1117
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,480
Boss, ten skewers of lamb and two bottles of beer.

1118
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,740
Ten skewers of lamb and two bottles of beer, got it.

1119
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,880
Do you want garlic?

1120
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,940
I don't eat it, but you can.

1121
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,300
But after you eat it, don't try to kiss me.

1122
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,680
That won't do.

1123
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,719
Seriously.

1124
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:09,860
I'll kiss you beforehand then.

1125
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:13,579
Where did I kiss?

1126
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:15,780
What are you doing?

1127
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,100
I kissed your eye.

1128
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,999
Kissed your eye.

1129
00:57:18,999 --> 00:57:22,579
This city is still bustling,

1130
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:24,899
and it won't stop for anyone,

1131
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:28,180
just like life.

1132
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:35,660
Recalling every person I've met,

1133
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:40,220
who didn't start by trying to get ahead?

1134
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,920
Between the gaps of pretense,

1135
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,559
giving oneself another shot of adrenaline.

1136
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,200
- Boss.
- What were you doing?

1137
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,080
- Subordinate.
- How did Wang Yanhong teach you?

1138
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,920
You asked me to write a recommendation letter and give you high scores

1139
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,619
so that you can handle big cases under a Senior Partner.

1140
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:00,060
Are you out of your mind?

1141
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,340
Rival. Friend.

1142
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:07,019
Trap yourself in one role after another,

1143
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:11,060
saying what you should say, doing what you should do,

1144
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:16,220
and believing that this is your life.

1145
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,520
Stop messing around.

1146
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,020
Let go!

1147
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:30,720
But they, as if they had agreed,

1148
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,519
when they have perfected their act,

1149
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:36,240
they see a layer of truth.

1150
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,740
Happiness, success, and joy

1151
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,559
can't possibly be the result designed by the scriptwriter of life.

1152
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,120
can't possibly be the result designed by the scriptwriter of life.

1153
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,700
It can only be your own tangible experience.

1154
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,239
I've met many people in this city,

1155
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,820
and they eventually taught me

1156
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:56,120
that the world is big, too big to imagine,

1157
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,199
so walk your own path,

1158
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:00,639
not according to the written script.

1159
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:03,979
Throw away the script,

1160
00:59:03,979 --> 00:59:08,319
and struggle to find your own life.

1161
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,960
It's okay to fail.

1162
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,820
It's okay to take the wrong road.

1163
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:20,180
Live freely.

1164
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:24,060
Isn't that the most stylish thing?
