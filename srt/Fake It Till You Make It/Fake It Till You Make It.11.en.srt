So festive.

Look over there. Do you see that community?

00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,800
Xinzi and Xu Jiabai used to live there.

Hey, over there. That residential area, look.

After I graduated, that was the first house I lived in.

At that time, I was sharing a rental.

Five people in one room.

Getting up in the morning, oh my.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,159
We had to scramble to brush our teeth, and even queue up.

13
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,320
It's okay. We'll share a rental and I won't fight with you.

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,460
That one, there.

15
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,280
That yellow house there, do you see it?

16

I moved there later.

Less than half a year later, even more dramatically, the heating pipe burst.

When I came home, the floor was like, like soaked kelp.

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,200
Wait! You haven't been in Beijing for long, but how many times have you moved?

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,359
Wait, you haven't been in Beijing for long, but how many times have you moved?

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,920
Being a Beijing drifter, this is normal.

The commute time is over three hours.

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,580
Why move further and further away?

28
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,460
Well, getting married and having kids.

You can't always live in a single room. Right?

30

Mr. Rich Guy, you're like a well-fed man who doesn't know what hunger is.

Mr. Rich Guy, you're like a well-fed man who doesn't know what hunger is.

Really! If they have the money, who wouldn't want to live in the city?

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,939
Mr. Cheng, why did you suddenly think of inviting me here?

38
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,279
Having been to Beijing so many times,

39
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:30,099
this is the first time I thought of visiting the Old Summer Palace, and I thought of you.

40
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,980
Running east and west, taken as pleasure.

41
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,700
Is this pleasure watching people go around in circles? How conceited.

42
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,819
Is this pleasure watching people go around in circles? How conceited.

43
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,419
Well then, let's go along and have some fun.

Tang Ying, I realize you've really grown up.

47
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:02,179
Sometimes when I look at you, I still think you're the same little girl from ten years ago.

48
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:05,719
Sometimes when I look at you, I still think you're the same little girl from ten years ago.

49
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,219
But sometimes, I feel like you've become very unfamiliar.

50
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,559
It's been ten years, so it's normal to be unfamiliar.

51
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:16,659
It's been ten years, so it's normal to be unfamiliar.

52
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,920
You're right. Being unfamiliar is good, too.

What do you think about Mr. Hu? Is he reliable?

65
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,380
Not really. He's not Xinzi's type.

66
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,040
What about you? What's your type?

67
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,460
I thought you knew my type.

68
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,620
So, it hasn't changed until now.

69
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,720
I don't like married ones.

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,680
I got divorced, three months ago.

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,440

Don't chat in the dead end.

Is it that obvious?

But... I still hope you can have a better future on the path ahead.

173

But... I still hope you can have a better future on the path ahead.
[Manager's Signature]

174
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,008
Here you go.

175
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:00,112
Jin Hao.

176
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,280
Perhaps we'll meet again someday.

177
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,740
Perhaps we'll meet again someday.

178
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,880
Miss Tang, what happened to you?

179
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,920
I'm fine. Just a little toothache.

180
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,320
What about you? You look so gloomy.

181
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,779
Do you miss Miss Han because she left?

182
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,280
Don't make me start. I just got scolded by Mr. Zheng.

183
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,199
I'm so sick of it.

184
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Ever since the complaint from Mr. Ma, she's been slacking off,

185
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,699
Ever since the complaint from Mr. Ma, she's been slacking off,

186
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:43,080
leaving me to do all the work.

187
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,320
I heard she has even taken on external cases secretly.

188
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,680
She can do that all she wants,

189
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,840
but shouldn't she at least sort out the firm's affairs first?

190
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,700
but shouldn't she at least sort out the firm's affairs first?

191
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,960
When Mr. Zheng asks, I have to cover for her, saying she's out meeting clients.

192
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,560
When Mr. Zheng asks, I have to cover for her, saying she's out meeting clients.

193
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,260
Mr. Zheng just caught me and gave me a good scolding,

194
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,840
saying I was procrastinating, not ambitious, not meticulous,

195
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,679
and not suitable for this line of work.

196
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,579
I really wanted to tell Mr. Zheng everything all in one go

197
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:09,120
so that I don't have to take the blame.

198
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,240
I don't really like Miss Han either, you know that.

199
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,440
I don't really like Miss Han either, you know that.

200
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
But... you have to admit that if she can disappear for so long,

201
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,880
there must be reasons.

202
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,939
Miss Wang told me that Miss Han's husband...

203
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,440
runs an education business, which went bankrupt due to poor management,

204
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,559
runs an education business, which went bankrupt due to poor management,

205
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,359
losing a lot of money.

206
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,759
That's why Miss Han has been scrambling for resources everywhere like crazy.

207
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,400
That's why Miss Han has been scrambling for resources everywhere like crazy.

208
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,239
But you know, everyone has their difficulties.

209
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,360
If everyone were as shortsighted as her,

210
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,959
only doing things that harm others and not benefit themselves,

211
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,839
the workplace environment would only get worse.

212
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,960
Do you think she deserves this position?

213
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,179
In fact, Miss Han has been nice to you.

214
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,260
At least she taught you a lot. Right?

215
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,980
When she comes back, you should talk to her and see what she's thinking.

216
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,100
When she comes back, you should talk to her and see what she's thinking.

217
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,219
If she doesn't take the hint, you can make your decision.

218
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,720
Come on, take your medicine.

219
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,740
Here, take it slow. Don't choke.

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,200
You understand what I'm saying. Right?

221
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,260
You see, if Ziyao really takes advantage of Han Han's absence,

222
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,679
You see, if Ziyao really takes advantage of Han Han's absence,

223
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,280
and tells Mr. Zheng that Han Han has been taking on private projects

224
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,300
and delaying many cases in the firm,

225
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,499
Han Han will undoubtedly have to leave.

226
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:38,879
I understand, but everyone

227
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,519
sometimes stands at the crossroads of critical times. Right?

228
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,920
sometimes stands at the crossroads of critical times. Right?

229
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,479
What you can do is just remind her of it.

230
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,060
Whether she listens or not, that's her business.

231
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,140
Whether she listens or not, that's her business.

232
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,620
But speaking of which,

233
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,539
if she really does that,

234
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,819
Han Han brought it on upon herself. Right?

235
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,680
If she really does that,

236
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,900
you'll have to be careful dealing with her in the future.

237
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,320
Why make the workplace so competitive?

238
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,500
Is it necessary?

239
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,440
It's just to survive.

240
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,519
Let's go for a walk and digest our food.

241
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,780
No, you're going on a business trip tomorrow,

242
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,440
I need to pack your luggage later.

243
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,419
Hug, come.

244
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,879
Hug, hug, hug.

245
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,419
Take good care of yourself.

246
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:51,520
We've broken up.

247
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,864
[Lin Xinzi]

248
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,180
So it's sorted?

249
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,200
We've cleared things up.

250
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,500
Let's have a meal together in a couple of days.

251
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,459
We can also invite Mr. Hu.

252
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,220
He has also been worried a lot recently.

253
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,500
Of course, this is a good thing to celebrate.

254
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,740
Let's make plans in the next few days.

255
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,580
Whenever you're free. Contact me anytime.

256
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,220
My treat.

257
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,839
Xinzi still broke up with the man

258
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,400
who scored the highest on her data chart.

259
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,819
Can love really be calculated with a formula?

260
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,788
Miss, raise your hand a bit higher.

261
00:15:26,788 --> 00:15:27,879
Okay, all right.

262
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,159
Higher… not that high.

263
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,340
Lower… higher than before.

264
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,144
Do you want it?

265
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,360
Talk to me first.

266
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,620
I… I'm quite anxious.

267
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,639
I'm out of ideas and anxious.

268
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,579
It's my first time being the defendant.

269
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,980
I haven't been able to sleep for days.

270
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:54,620
I admit, I plagiarized.

271
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,039
What about the compensation the other party is asking for?

272
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,540
I'm telling you. I don't have a penny.

273
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,620
They can put me in jail.

274
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,040
I did some research on you before.

275
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,000
You're a young adult literature author.

276
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,620
Top ten bestselling on the author's list.

277
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,060
I saw online that they say what you write

278
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,739
I saw online that they say what you write

279
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,179
can make an iron tree bloom and make a nun want to return to secular life.

280
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:18,500
can make an iron tree bloom and make a nun want to return to secular life.

281
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,100
Your level is very high.

282
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,499
Such a professionally trained high-level writer,

283
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,519
it would be too much of a waste.

284
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,900
Are you an employee from my uncle's place?

285
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,840
Junheng Law Firm, Tang Ying.

286
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,519
That… That… The plagiarized text, you should have read it.

287
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,239
That… That… The plagiarized text, you should have read it.

288
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:42,059
You must find it a bit strange.

289
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:44,800
The plagiarized content is all clustered in

290
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,119
the most recently updated chapter.

291
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,320
I admit I plagiarized,

292
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,200
and the person I plagiarized from

293
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,639
is another author on the hot list,

294
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,959
who happens to be my good friend.

295
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,500
Look. I've been in this business for more than a decade.

296
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,160
Am I really that clueless?

297
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,060
I'll tell you the truth.

298
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,200
Before, my friends and I, our works, big and small,

299
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,560
Before, my friends and I, our works, big and small,

300
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,220
had been plagiarized many times.

301
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,559
Those people copied our works, changed them,

302
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,340
made them into TV dramas,

303
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,559
and we couldn't win the lawsuits against them.

304
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,820
Quite funny, right?

305
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,400
Since then, I started practicing Tai Chi.

306
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,720
Since then, I started practicing Tai Chi.

307
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,680
I think it's an irony of life.

308
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,960
I think it's an irony of life.

309
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,479
As a martial artist,

310
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,480
I can't just go to their company and smash their company, can I?

311
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,880
I can't just go to their company and smash their company, can I?

312
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,439
But what can I do?

313
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:41,979
I can only resort to a suicide attack.

314
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:45,100
But I know you authors

315
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,940
treat your work like your children.

316
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,919
Are you really willing to harm your own children?

317
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,500
And if you think about it, it's very likely that people will stand up

318
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,759
And if you think about it, it's very likely that people will stand up

319
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,739
and say you're just trying to hype things up.

320
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:02,580
Once the public opinion is slightly skewed,

321
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,520
you may not be able to achieve what you want.

322
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,240
And the entire industry will resist you.

323
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,780
Is this what you want?

324
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,740
Can you bear this outcome?

325
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,799
Do you think it's worth it?

326
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,000
You're the first lawyer who asked me this.

327
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,659
I'll tell you the truth.

328
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:35,080
It might sound a bit melodramatic.

329
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm certainly not a saint,

330
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,100
but I really want to know

331
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,720
if I plagiarized and lost the case,

332
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,060
would those who plagiarized from us also lose?

333
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,480
would those who plagiarized from us also lose?

334
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,919
I'm willing to sacrifice myself

335
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,380
if it can bring those jerks down.

336
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,080
It will be worth it.

337
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,140
Miss Tang,

338
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,459
are you willing to help us?

339
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,490
A lawyer is a service provider.

340
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,620
What is the essence of a service provider?

341
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,459
It's to provide valuable content to the client.

342
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:19,180
If you serve your client well,

343
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,680
then the client will pay for the legal knowledge you've learned.

344
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,120
A lawyer must keep up with the times, constantly discovering new opportunities,

345
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,640
A lawyer must keep up with the times, constantly discovering new opportunities,

346
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,179
using legal knowledge in the grey areas where the law is not yet perfect

347
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:32,199
and safeguard the client's rights.

348
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,979
This is a true representation of a lawyer's capabilities.

349
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,000
Law is used to protect citizens' rights,

350
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,960
regulate social behaviors,

351
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,340
and is the bottom line to maintaining social order.

352
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,019
Is my brother-in-law still on his business trip?

353
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,540
He hasn't even had time to contact me. He must be busy.

354
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,620
You have a boyfriend now?

355
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,240
Guess you can't be a little girl forever.

356
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,499
Not only do I have a boyfriend,

357
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:15,100
but he's also very handsome.

358
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,499
Mr. Cheng, don't worry.

359
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:18,880
If you put it that way, it actually worries me.

360
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,159
If you put it that way, it actually worries me.

361
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:22,260
Handsome guy, huh?

362
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,900
Can you, a little girl, handle him?

363
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,319
Why don't you invite him out one day and let me help you evaluate?

364
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,520
Why don't you invite him out one day and let me help you evaluate?

365
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,000
He's not a demon, he doesn't need handling,

366
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,240
and he certainly doesn't need your evaluation.

367
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,739
You should worry more about yourself.

368
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:36,279
Eat your food.

369
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,759
Xinzi, this is something I ordered specially,

370
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,560
Xinzi, this is something I ordered specially,

371
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,940
braised eel in oil.

372
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,419
The season is especially important.

373
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:46,860
As the saying goes, "Eel in late summer is as good as ginseng."

374
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,840
No, I'm serious, you try it.

375
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,219
It's really delicious, have a taste.

376
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,179
Let's drink.

377
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:54,680
Come on.

378
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,559
Let's celebrate Xinzi's happy breakup.

379
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,020
Out with the old and in with the new.

380
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,040
You should be happy.

381
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:17,680
You still don't look very happy.

382
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:21,100
Do you know why she's not happy?

383
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,500
Because when she thinks the new one could possibly be you,

384
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,260
Because when she thinks the new one could possibly be you,

385
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,459
she just can't feel happy anymore.

386
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,599
The old fox has dug through my psychological activities.

387
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,120
You're really annoying. Come on.

388
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,200
Mr. Cheng, you're funny.

389
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,680
The crab roe tofu is delicious.

390
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,359
Then you guys…

391
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,660
Xinzi, how about I take you home?

392
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,060
- We took a taxi.
- Don't worry, I'm here.

393
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,100
Well, stay cheerful.

394
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,839
I'll go first. Goodbye.

395
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,620
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

396
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,860
- Bye.
- Bye.

397
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,292
Bye.

398
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,960
- Sis, the car is almost here.
- Xinzi.

399
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,440
I see a friend. I'll go say hi. Wait for me.

400
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,908
I see a friend. I'll go say hi. Wait for me.

401
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:10,620
Where are you going?

402
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,595
[Ziyao]

403
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,580
Thanks to my brother-in-law's business trip,

404
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,079
I can still enjoy luxury housing in the CBD during my single period.

405
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,240
I can still enjoy luxury housing in the CBD during my single period.

406
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,720
The first few days after a breakup are tough.

407
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,960
The first few days after a breakup are tough.

408
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,440
It's better to not be alone.

409
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Stay here for a few more days, and I'll keep you company.

410
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,088
You know,

411
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,519
the best candidate I found according to my plan before was Xu Jiabai.

412
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,599
the best candidate I found according to my plan before was Xu Jiabai.

413
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,219
the best candidate I found according to my plan before was Xu Jiabai.

414
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,979
The standard that he most conforms to was

415
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:27,680
whether he can really be good to me.

416
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,359
He really did it. Right?

417
00:23:31,219 --> 00:23:33,759
But why isn't he a normal person?

418
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:37,419
I'm very doubtful about my plan now.

419
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:38,960
Look. It's said that love is a two-way road.

420
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,580
Look. It's said that love is a two-way road.

421
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,599
It makes a lot of sense.

422
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:46,200
Real good love is not about finding someone with great conditions who treats you well,

423
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,340
Real good love is not about finding someone with great conditions who treats you well,

424
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,740
Real good love is not about finding someone with great conditions who treats you well,

425
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,719
or that kind of self-moving, self-sacrificing person.

426
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,160
or that kind of self-moving, self-sacrificing person.

427
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,799
or that kind of self-moving, self-sacrificing person.

428
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,719
Real good love is the match of two personalities.

429
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:57,180
Real good love is the match of two personalities.

430
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,820
Comfort is very important.

431
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,000
With you and Xu Jiabai, he's comfortable but you're not, right?

432
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,100
With you and Xu Jiabai, he's comfortable but you're not. Right?

433
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,660
It's too hard.

434
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,179
Love is too hard.

435
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:11,599
Brother Hu?

436
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,400
Forget about him.

437
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,680
The big taboo in dating is you can't go from one backup guy to another.

438
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,720
The big taboo in dating is you can't go from one backup guy to another.

439
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,180
The big taboo in dating is you can't go from one backup guy to another.

440
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,240
It would be finding trouble for yourself.

441
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,140
It would be finding trouble for yourself.

442
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,000
Makes sense.

443
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,739
I've also pondered a question.

444
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,660
What kind of feeling is it like to provide?

445
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,019
What kind of feeling is it like to provide?

446
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,040
I always thought before,

447
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,920
if in a relationship, you're providing too much,

448
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,660
if in a relationship, you're providing too much,

449
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,820
you would have higher expectations

450
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,499
for this relationship. Right?

451
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:50,179
But if you don't get the expected return,

452
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:51,919
won't you be hurt more?

453
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,100
How would you know if you don't try?

454
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,088
Makes sense.

455
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,100
There are 3.5 billion men in the world.

456
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,400
I don't believe I can't meet a higher score in the future.

457
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
I thought you were going to say, "All 3.5 billion men are mine."

458
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,680
I thought you were going to say, "All 3.5 billion men are mine."

459
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,760
I'm now in Shanghai.

460
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,240
When I get back to Beijing…

461
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:25,152
[Tang Ying]

462
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,020
♫ More, more, more... What a feeling ♫

463
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,659
They should be quick.

464
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,690
[Tang Ying]
They have been going through the processes recently.

465
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,970
♫ Never felt like this before ♫

466
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,760
Okay, let's talk later.

467
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,504
Goodbye.

468
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,319
Hello, baby. What are you doing?

469
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,740
Miss me yet?

470
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,920
I hung up on you because I was on the phone with a client.

471
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,179
I hung up on you because I was on the phone with a client.

472

♫ Something you must be needing ♫

473
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,279
Are you mad?

474
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:08,060
No, I often encounter situations

475
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,060
where clients need me at night.

476
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,580
If I suddenly disappear in the future,

477
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,980
don't ever assume that I'm cheating.

478
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,800
don't ever assume that I'm cheating.

479
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,960
Have you been missing me obediently?

480
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:23,419
Not very obedient, I guess.

481
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:25,119
If I were really obedient, I wouldn't be calling you at this hour.

482
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,720
If I were really obedient, I wouldn't be calling you at this hour.

483
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:31,670
Well, you should miss me obediently.

484
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,340
Love you.

485
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,008
Where are they?

486
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:47,540
They left for the next event.

I'm the only one here waiting for you.

488
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:51,179
I thought you had slipped away secretly.

489
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,179
I just called my girlfriend.

Waiter, check, please.

00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,088
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

- Not bad.

Let me see.

495

Okay.

Actually, you've met her.

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,890
- Hello
- Here you go.

498
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,100
Thank you.

499

Not as pretty as me, nor as rich.

Xu Ziquan, are you blind?

501
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,360
- I think she's fine.
- Are you upset?

502
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,440
- I think she's fine.
- Are you upset?

503
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,620
All right, I'll make it up to you.

504
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,459
I see she's still wearing out-of-season clothes.

505
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,980
The next time I go to Beijing,

506
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,960
I'll buy her the latest styles.

507
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,800
Is this relationship serious or just for fun?

508
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,960
You're not going to introduce her to your parents, are you?

509
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,460
Of course, I'm serious.

510
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,580
So this is your type.

511
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,120
Are you two happy together?

00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,319
I like everything about her. And I'm very happy.

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
So, break up with your girlfriend and be with me.

519
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,300
So, break up with your girlfriend and be with me.

520
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,919
You've had too much to drink.

521
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:33,419
You don't have to answer me right away.

522
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,939
I'll give you time to think about it.

523
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:39,219
I'm leaving. Goodbye.

524
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,140
Tang Ying, come over here.

525
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,100
What did Maomao say to you?

526
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,799
What did she say?

527
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,920
She's my sister's child.

528
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,700
Our family is full of lawyers,

529
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,419
and she's the only odd one.

530
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:16,000
Mr. Zheng, I wanted to talk to you about it.

531
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,920
There's something you don't know about this case.

532
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,660
Maomao plagiarized on purpose.

533
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,960
Her purpose, if we put it in a bigger context,

534
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,580
is to draw attention to the importance of intellectual property.

535
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,200
This is the most troubling and headache-inducing part for me.

536
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,199
This is the most troubling and headache-inducing part for me.

537
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:37,320
Tang, you're a smart and ambitious lawyer.

538
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,279
You should take this more seriously for me.

539
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,640
Have her apologize

540
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,100
and admit her mistake soon.

541
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,960
My sister's health isn't good.

542
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,559
Don't let her mess around anymore.

543
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,860
Actually, I think Maomao is quite brave.

544
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,000
Of course, rest assured, Mr. Zheng,

545
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,340
I will handle this properly.

546
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,976
Miss Tang.

547
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,088
What's up?

548
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,699
How have you been with Ma recently?

549
00:30:19,699 --> 00:30:22,920
Pretty good, other than being broke.

550
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,820
If there's anything you need my help with,

551
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,900
you must tell me.

552
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,720
Miss Tang, Ma has found a job.

553
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,119
He's busy all day now.

554
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,799
We don't have much of a problem with our basic living now.

555
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,300
What job has he found?

556
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,728
A listed company, Find a House.

557
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
Find a House?

558
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,900
Often in the evening, he has to take people to see houses.

559
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,000
That's great. Good for him.

560
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,699
Tell Ma, I'll treat him to a meal one of these days.

561
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,279
I'm quite thankful to him.

562
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,259
Now, it's hard to find a job in investment banking.

563
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:07,179
He is willing to endure hardship

564
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:10,340
and support my dream of becoming a lawyer.

565
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,160
When I become a full-fledged lawyer like you all,

566
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,860
I will support him.

567
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,219
Has Mr. Zheng stopped making things difficult for you?

568
00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:25,739
Does distributing meals count as difficulty?

569
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,279
Well, for all the matters that Miss Han delayed,

570
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,840
Well, for all the matters that Miss Han delayed,

571
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,880
I have explained one by one to the clients.

572
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,320
I have explained one by one to the clients.

573
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,340
I said that she had gone on a business trip,

574
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,160
and if there are any important matters, I will be responsible for following up.

575
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,340
I have also explained to Mr. Zheng.

576
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,400
Ziyao, you are really doing a very good job now.

577
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,299
Ziyao, you are really doing a very good job now.

578
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:46,699
When Miss Han returns,

579
00:31:46,699 --> 00:31:49,600
she will definitely have a great change of heart towards you.

580
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,380
Miss Tang, you are right.

581
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,299
We can't break our own principles

582
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:57,160
because of others' mistakes.

583
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,100
I should thank you.

584
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Thank me for what?

585
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,019
Crap. Crap.

586
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:06,780
I didn't order enough food.

587
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,079
The boss said he invited the rising star in academia, Professor Yan Lvning

588
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,759
The boss said he invited the rising star in academia, Professor Yan Lvning

589
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:10,839
to talk to everyone about the newly revised E-commerce Law.

590
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,940
to talk to everyone about the newly revised E-commerce Law.

591
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,880
As a result, other teams all signed up when they heard that Yan Lvning was coming.

592
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,980
As a result, other teams all signed up when they heard that Yan Lvning was coming.

593
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,799
Who?

594
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:22,200
Yan Lvning.

595
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,480
Today, let's talk about what E-commerce Law is.

596
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,220
Today, let's talk about what E-commerce Law is.

597
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,680
With the dynamic changes in online sales forms,

598
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,880
With the dynamic changes in online sales forms,

599
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,819
in order to better manage and regulate the market,

600
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:35,200
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed

601
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,760
the "People's Republic of China E-commerce Law" in 2019.

602
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,200
the "People's Republic of China E-commerce Law" in 2019.

603
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,040
- He's pretty handsome, huh?
- Implementation.

604
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,400
He's even more handsome in person, clean and neat.

605
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,519
E-commerce activities all apply this law.

606
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,980
So what is E-commerce Law?

607
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,839
- E-commerce refers to…
- Isn't he?

608
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:51,920
Through the internet…

609
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,499
Do you know how many people came for him today?

610
00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:57,680
He is talking about e-commerce.

611
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,939
What do these people do?

612
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,000
They all came for him.

613
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,319
Is he really that popular?

614
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,380
Of course.

615
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,920
He is the happiness of a hundred thousand young female lawyers.

616
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,720
I just found out.

617
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,959
Some basic content of e-commerce.

618
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:18,720
Okay, I will share this much today.

619
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,799
If there is anything you still want to know or don't understand,

620
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,799
If there is anything you still want to know or don't understand,

621
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,760
we will talk about it next time. Okay?

622
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,240
Mr. Yan, this is our e-commerce…

623
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,908
Look.

624
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,859
- May I have your contact?
- Note it down.

625
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:43,219
CWDvip@126.com.

626
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,000
I will be at the coffee shop downstairs of your law firm

627
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,076
waiting for you to get off work.

628
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,820
You all wrote it down, right?

629
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,920
Yes.

630
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,559
Okay, I'll leave first.

631
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,560
See you next time.

632
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,160
Did he just look at me?

633
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,128
Oh my god.

634
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:14,840
♫ If you don't lay down beside me ♫

635
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:22,730
♫ I still come running to you again ♫

636
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,519
Where to?

637
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,800
To eat.

638
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,099
How many restaurants have you prepared?

639
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:34,599
Ten restaurants.

640
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,304
Ten?

641
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:46,950
♫ But my eyes were opened ♫

642
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:54,850
♫ When you let me love you again ♫

643
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,720
This porgy is probably not wild.

644
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:10,199
You can tell?

645
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,199
Yes. Wild porgy has a sweetness in your mouth,

646
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,440
Yes. Wild porgy has a sweetness in your mouth,

647
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,760
but this porgy is just tasteless in the mouth.

648
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,680
but this porgy is just tasteless in the mouth.

649
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,599
Brother Hu, you are amazing.

650
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,320
What's so amazing? I just love studying food.

651
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,079
Take me to eat more in the future, okay?

652
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,620
Shall I take you to eat every day?

653
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,480
I will take you to that roast chicken restaurant first.

654
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,520
Their "lanterns" are simply amazing.

655
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,619
What is a lantern?

656
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,400
- Let me see.
- You look it up.

657
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,832
- Let me see.
- You look it up.

658
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,039
This one?

659
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,660
Yes, this one.

660
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,220
Don't tell me he was taken away

661
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,499
by a young girl like that.

662
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,080
That's so crazy.

663
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,520
I didn't like him anyway. I'm out.

664
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,800
Did he say anything later?

665
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,939
He did. Later, we met in the tea room again.

666
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:58,519
He told me a homophonic joke.

667
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,780
By the way,

668
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:07,824
I'm in love.

669
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,240
We all know.

670
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,919
Yes, I just thought I should tell you.

671
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,719
Yes, I just thought I should tell you.

672
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:17,579
Because this is, in a way, a complete farewell.

673
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:18,679
Life, after all, needs to have a beginning and an end. Right?

674
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,040
Life, after all, needs to have a beginning and an end. Right?

675
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,200
Kexin is a nice girl. I wish you both happiness.

676
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,880
Thank you.

677
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,959
Right, you should keep this.

678
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,260
Wait! Your love announcement comes with a gift?

679
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,744
No.

680
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,040
I really wanted to give you a future.

681
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,239
But now, I have decided to give this future to someone else.

682
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:44,939
So, I'm giving you a cup.

683
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:48,360
It's a bit old-fashioned.

684
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,059
How romantic! I have to go now.

685
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:53,459
Thank you.

686
00:36:53,459 --> 00:36:55,120
What the hell? Isn't that funny?

687
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,220
What the hell? Isn't that funny?

688
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,700
From now on, he won't have a name in my world.

689
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,368
Oh my god.

690
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,980
You say, if Cheng Ke

691
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,959
also didn't have a name in my world, what would it look like?

692
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:08,900
also didn't have a name in my world, what would it look like?

693
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,980
You two should never have met.

694
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,119
Just pretend he's dead.

695
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,080
You're right.

696
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:18,220
I almost forgot to tell you.

697
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,840
- I went to see a house today. I have decided on it.
- You've decided?

698
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,360
- I went to see a house today. I have decided on it.
- You've decided?

699
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,159
- I went to see a house today. I have decided on it.
- You've decided?

700
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,159
- Yes.
- So fast?

701
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,180
Yes.

702
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,239
Have you thought it over?

703
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:29,280
Am I going to live in your mansion for a lifetime?

704
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,979
I would be too ignorant then.

705
00:37:30,979 --> 00:37:33,079
And the second landlord I found is kind of handsome.

706
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,579
And the second landlord I found is kind of handsome.

707
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:37,480
Wait! A second landlord?

708
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,740
You're a little princess. How can you share a house?

709
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,260
It's not easy to find a house now.

710
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,380
And I really need to save money.

711
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,159
Having a handsome landlord is also a gain. Right?

712
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:49,020
Having a handsome landlord is also a gain. Right?

713
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,920
Handsome.

714
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
This is the first time I've heard the word 'handsome' from your mouth.

715
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,360
This is the first time I've heard the word 'handsome' from your mouth.

716
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,559
You said Xu Jiabai was elegant and clean.

717
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:58,760
You said Xu Jiabai was elegant and clean.

718
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,000
Xu Ziquan, average facial features,

719
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,880
a good figure, and good aesthetic taste.

720
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,480
Brother Hu, cheesy.

721
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,719
But this cute guy, you said "handsome."

722
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:14,380
Something's up.

723
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,119
What I said was very objective. Okay?

724
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,640
I'm just telling the truth.

725
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,260
He seems to be called something like Xia Tian.

726
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,519
He's quite tall, but he really has delicate features.

727
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:30,419
His face is just as big as a palm, almost like mine.

728
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:31,760
Although he is called Xia Tian (summer), he is cold to me.

729
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,739
Although he is called Xia Tian (summer), he is cold to me.

730
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:34,979
So, this is out with the old, in with the new. Right?

731
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,319
So, this is out with the old, in with the new. Right?

732
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,000
Can't you just let me win?

733
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,300
You're too bad at this.

734
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,260
I miss you.

735
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,148
I'm done playing.

736
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,800
What's wrong? Did he text you?

737
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,220
When will you be back?

738
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,379
People in love are unbearable to the broken-hearted.

739
00:38:56,379 --> 00:38:58,599
People in love are unbearable to the broken-hearted.

740
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:01,339
I'm going to take a bath.

741
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:04,480
You guys go ahead.

742
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,940
Probably two more days. What's up?

743
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,000
Miss my hug?

744
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:18,400
You're really annoying.

745
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,499
Today, I invited Mr. Xie from Shi Zhi Literature City.

746
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:42,639
Tang, how's the case progressing?

747
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:44,079
Well, according to the evidence submitted by Maomao,

748
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,400
Well, according to the evidence submitted by Maomao,

749
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,720
it's clear that this was indeed

750
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,920
a somewhat excusable breach of contract.

751
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,280
Of course, I know

752
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,679
essentially, it has caused some reputational damage to Shi Zhi Literature City.

753
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,740
essentially, it has caused some reputational damage to Shi Zhi Literature City.

754
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,820
But last week, Maomao explained

755
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,880
But last week, Maomao explained

756
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,320
the causes and effects of this event on her Weibo.

757
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,740
the causes and effects of this event on her Weibo.

758
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,400
After the netizens read it,

759
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,280
they all expressed sympathy and understanding.

760
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,960
The netizens also hope that

761
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,580
Shi Zhi Literature City can introduce some measures

762
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,240
Shi Zhi Literature City can introduce some measures

763
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,519
that have a regulatory effect on plagiarism.

764
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,999
Mr. Xie also thinks this is a good thing. Right?

765
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,199
We can settle this,

766
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,360
but I hope the writer you represent

767
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,000
will renew the contract with our platform for another five years.

768
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,559
Good, I will note that in the meeting minutes.

769
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:39,600
We will carefully study the minutes drafted by Miss Tang after

770
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,320
we return.

771
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,680
I can't speak for other platforms,

772
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,000
but we at Shi Zhi will definitely be strict in the future,

773
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,579
but we at Shi Zhi will definitely be strict in the future,

774
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,719
resolutely preventing plagiarism and imitation.

775
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,080
resolutely preventing plagiarism and imitation.

776
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,319
That's good. That's the best.

777
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,539
Miss Tang, I hope that through your efforts,

778
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,720
the domestic intellectual property environment will become better and better.

779
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,440
the domestic intellectual property environment will become better and better.

780
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,660
In this way, what we are doing now will become even more meaningful.

781
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,139
In this way, what we are doing now will become even more meaningful.

782
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,240
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

783
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,220
I will definitely do my best.

784
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,719
I really didn't expect that one day,

785
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,560
I really didn't expect that one day,

786
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,300
I could tell this as a joke.

787
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,720
Wang resigned and then the Walrus case failed.

788
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,419
Wang resigned and then the Walrus case failed.

789
00:41:19,419 --> 00:41:23,300
It was a bitter period.

790
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,760
But when you think about it now,

791
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,019
those pains are just bygones.

792
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:30,919
So I was thinking, those who feel desperate,

793
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:33,260
So I was thinking, those who feel desperate,

794
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,659
who feel they can't get through,

795
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,359
shouldn't they think the same way?

796
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:38,879
During the darkest and most desperate times,

797
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:40,340
as long as you grit your teeth and hold on,

798
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,360
after a while, they will feel what I just felt,

799
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,660
and they could make a joke out of it.

800
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,720
As long as you think this way, you can keep going.

801
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,819
As long as you think this way, you can keep going.

802
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:48,239
All I can say is people, most of the time,

803
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,280
All I can say is people, most of the time,

804
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,519
can only rely on themselves.

805
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:52,400
Expecting others to empathize is unlikely.

806
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,840
Expecting others to empathize is unlikely.

807
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,039
What we can do is to have more empathy for others' situations.

808
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:56,400
What we can do is to have more empathy for others' situations.

809
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,579
What we can do is to have more empathy for others' situations.

810
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:00,320
Empathy is really very important for a lawyer.

811
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,319
Empathy is really very important for a lawyer.

812
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,419
Perhaps, this is the meaning of being a lawyer.

813
00:42:05,419 --> 00:42:08,180
When you encounter something painful,

814
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,840
and your partner, your lover, your friends,

815
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,039
your family, none of them can understand or support you,

816
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:13,380
your family, none of them can understand or support you,

817
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,560
at least there are us, people in this profession,

818
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,680
who can stand up to help you solve problems,

819
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,820
and then be able to maintain justice.

820
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,519
We are not as noble as you say.

821
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,659
We will still charge for our services.

822
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:26,800
But having a starting point is also very good.

823
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,580
But having a starting point is also very good.

824
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,619
Anyway, I've decided. I want to be a good lawyer.

825
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:33,340
Anyway, I've decided. I want to be a good lawyer.

826
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,976
Okay.

827
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,820
By the way, when are you going to have your wisdom tooth removed?

828
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,512
This afternoon.

829
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,680
Come on, open your mouth let me see.

830
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:47,108
Open a bit wider.

831
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,740
Come, we'll give you an anesthetic.

832
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,619
Open your mouth. We're starting now.

833
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:56,908
Don't be nervous.

834
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,576
Hold on.

835
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:12,919
Good, it's done. The tooth is out.

836
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,616
Does it still hurt?

837
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:25,180
Hello?

838
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,699
Miss Tang, Literature City has contacted me.

839
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,820
I really need to thank you.

840
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,320
I didn't expect this matter to be resolved so smoothly.

841
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,280
I didn't expect this matter to be resolved so smoothly.

842
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:38,979
It's what I should do, no need to thank me.

843
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:41,400
Then I'll invite you for a meal to thank you in person.

844
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,840
Okay, but it will have to wait a few days.

845
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,039
I just had a tooth pulled.

846
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,380
I can't eat yet.

847
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,800
All right, in a few days then. Thank you.

848
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,100
Good, good. Congratulations.

849
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,879
You're back.

850
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,840
Why are you watching this show?

851
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,619
This show is really popular lately,

852
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:33,039
and I've been bored recently,

853
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,039
so I thought I'd learn to sing.

854
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,199
You want to learn to sing?

855
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:40,560
I know a teacher, and I can introduce you.

856
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,600
I know a teacher, and I can introduce you.

857
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:48,259
Okay… Thank you. Thanks.

858
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,560
Then I'll go back.

I just watched your video.

866
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,080
You can sing very well.

867

I've followed your Weibo.

00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,239
like TikTok, Bilibili, etc.?

870
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:47,459
I've searched for a while, but I couldn't find any.

871
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,380
I have TikTok and Bilibili,

872
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,839
but they're under different names.

873
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,100
Can you help me search?

874
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,999
I'm just very curious.

875
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:06,220
Because I don't have such friends around me.

876
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,776
Here.

877
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,159
Thank you.

878
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,780
Thank you.

879
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,304
Keep it up.

880
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:30,459
What are you doing here?

881
00:46:30,459 --> 00:46:32,192
Waiting for you.

882
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,839
How do you know where I live?

883
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,340
It doesn't seem to be hard to find out where you live.

884
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,940
It doesn't seem to be hard to find out where you live.

885
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,840
Mainly because I'm going back to Guangzhou tomorrow,

886
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,979
and I wanted to see you before I left.

887
00:46:46,979 --> 00:46:49,520
Do you have something you want to say to me?

888
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,380
Not really, just…

889
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,019
Then I wish you a safe journey.

890
00:46:58,019 --> 00:46:59,700
My boyfriend is waiting for me upstairs,

891
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,700
and I have to go back for dinner.

892
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,480
Actually, that day in Old Summer Palace, you heard me on the phone. Right?

893
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,700
Actually, that day in Old Summer Palace, you heard me on the phone. Right?

894
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,440
I wanted to get a divorce a long time ago.

895
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,960
I don't know if you still remember…

896
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,552
Xu Ziquan.

897
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,820
What are you doing in Beijing?

898
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,119
I've thought about it for a long time.

899
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:24,880
I think I still need to make it clear to you,

900
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,220
so I booked the earliest flight to Beijing.

901
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,740
I like you.

902
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,059
Thank you, Chuanchuan.

903
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,840
But like I told you, I have a girlfriend now. Right?

904
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,219
But like I told you, I have a girlfriend now. Right?

905
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:38,660
Go back and stop messing around.

906
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,939
Who's messing with you?

907
00:47:40,939 --> 00:47:42,599
Who's messing with you?

908
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,519
No, what are you doing?

909
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:49,819
What are you doing? You…

910
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:50,480
Here's the deal, Chuanchuan. I've always seen you as a very good friend,

911
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,760
Here's the deal, Chuanchuan. I've always seen you as a very good friend,

912
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,119
Here's the deal, Chuanchuan. I've always seen you as a very good friend,

913
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,980
a friend who I can talk to. But…

914
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,360
a friend who I can talk to. But…

915
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,739
These young couples nowadays.

916
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:00,540
They all like to make a fuss in public.

917
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,880
- How do you know they are a couple?
- If I gave you any wrong signals, I apologize to you.

918
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,040
- How do you know they are a couple?
- If I gave you any wrong signals, I apologize to you.

919
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,120
- How do you know they are a couple?
- If I gave you any wrong signals, I apologize to you.

920
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,719
But I never saw us moving towards love, or…

921
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:08,059
But I never saw us moving towards love, or…

922
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:12,019
See? The girl is clinging to him.

923
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:13,760
You're sorry, right?

924
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,480
Okay, hug me then.

925
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,740
Hug me, and I'll go back to Shanghai.

926
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,720
No, what's the point of this hug?

927
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,459
Do you think he'll hug her?

928
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:25,059
Do you think he'll hug her?

929
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:27,059
Only a jerk would hug her.

930
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:29,479
Okay, all right.

931
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,900
Hey, that's not appropriate.

932
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,019
Okay, go back quickly.

933
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:42,039
Xu Ziquan, you're not cool at all.

934
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:46,579
Watch out for the cars.

935
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:49,159
She's more cunning than you used to be.

936
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:58,639
What a coincidence.

937
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:00,008
Yeah.

938
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:04,019
Do you know each other?

939
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:05,900
Let me introduce you.

940
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,280
This is the one I've mentioned many times,

941
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,540
This is the one I've mentioned many times,

942
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,560
my unrequited love, the moonlight of my memory.

943
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,820
And this guy, the one we just saw hugging and cuddling

944
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,920
And this guy, the one we just saw hugging and cuddling

945
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,480
And this guy, the one we just saw hugging and cuddling

946
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,679
with an unknown woman on the street, my roommate, Xu Ziquan.

947
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:19,740
with an unknown woman on the street, my roommate, Xu Ziquan.

948
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,190
Hello.

949
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,350
Hello.

950
00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:32,340
Okay, hurry and go home.

951
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,420
I'll come to find you next time I come.

952
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,679
All right. Mr. Cheng, goodbye.

953
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:39,439
Mr. Moonlight, won't you come in and sit?

954
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,060
Next time.

955
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:47,392
Next time.

956
00:49:58,751 --> 00:50:02,400
[Fan List]

957
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:10,419
Are these all your friends?

958
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,399
Three of them are my sub-accounts,

959
00:50:17,399 --> 00:50:19,079
and the others are

960
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:24,020
people I rallied to follow you.

961
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,619
I saw their profiles and found that they're from

962
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:27,679
I saw their profiles and found that they're from

963
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:30,819
Tsinghua, Peking University, and the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

964
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,660
They're all so impressive.

965
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:37,180
We are all amateurs,

966
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,639
just curious about the entertainment industry.

967
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,799
just curious about the entertainment industry.

968
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:43,140
After all, real stars are too far away.

969
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,219
It's more exciting to chase those close at hand.

970
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:49,700
Okay, then. Thanks, you guys.

971
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:52,579
You're welcome.

972
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:57,099
And there is a saying,

973
00:50:57,099 --> 00:50:59,419
"The ones who are not famous yet are the best."

974
00:50:59,419 --> 00:51:02,500
Because if you want to invest, invest in potential stocks. Right?

975
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,200
Aren't you a potential stock?

976
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,980
And my friends all said

977
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,740
you're handsome and can sing well.

978
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,039
You will definitely be famous in the future.

979
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:14,479
Then I can only say, your friends have good taste.

980
00:51:14,479 --> 00:51:17,559
You won't lose if you invest in me, rest assured.

981
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:21,360
We believe in you.

982
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,640
Fighting, fighting.

983
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:55,080
This is the 30th floor.

984
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,648
Well…

985
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,080
Let's chat.

986
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,990
Tang Ying.

987
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:42,640
Let's chat.

988
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,259
New wine?

989
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:28,139
Did you buy it to drink with me?

990
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,239
When did you buy this outfit?

991
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:35,360
You just had a tooth pulled.

992
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,379
Can you drink?

993
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:52,620
Have some alcohol to reduce inflammation, what's wrong?

994
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,520
That's wild.

995
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,059
When I'm angry, I tend to be quite wild.

996
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:01,780
Well, I'm not too happy either.

997
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:26,979
Come on, let's chat.

998
00:54:36,619 --> 00:54:38,368
Come.

999
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,019
I thought you'd be back a few days later.

1000
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:48,700
I wanted to surprise you.

1001
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:53,120
What a big surprise.

1002
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,360
Don't misunderstand.

1003
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,099
She is a young girl from an investment bank in Shanghai.

1004
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:02,240
We've had a few meals before and chatted.

1005
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,260
We've had a few meals before and chatted.

1006
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,679
But it's pure business between us.

1007
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,639
Don't drink so much.

1008
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,760
There's really nothing going on. Just business.

1009
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,680
There's really nothing going on. Just business.

1010
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,780
No private contact.

1011
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,768
I don't know why she followed me back to Beijing. She chased me here.

1012
00:55:16,768 --> 00:55:17,879
I don't know why she followed me back to Beijing. She chased me here.

1013
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:20,199
She's quite rich, huh?

1014
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:21,600
Chasing you from Shanghai to Beijing, doesn't she need to work?

1015
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,720
Chasing you from Shanghai to Beijing, doesn't she need to work?

1016
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,520
Her mother is a high-level executive at an investment bank,

1017
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,399
so she doesn't lack money.

1018
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,320
All right.

1019
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:38,592
What are you doing?

1020
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:43,319
She is rich and attractive,

1021
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,519
so why don't you be with her?

1022
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:47,880
What's the use of being rich and attractive? I don't like her.

1023
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,340
What's the use of being rich and attractive? I don't like her.

1024
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,260
Have you never liked her?

1025
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,480
Never.

1026
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,300
Then why did you hug her if you didn't like her?

1027
00:55:57,199 --> 00:55:58,528
All right.

1028
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:00,872
This is what happened.

1029
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,000
When I landed, she followed me to my doorstep. I told her she couldn't come in.

1030
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,280
When I landed, she followed me to my doorstep. I told her she couldn't come in.

1031
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,939
I told her my girlfriend was home,

1032
00:56:06,939 --> 00:56:08,360
and I told her from now on, don't bother me like this. Right?

1033
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,000
and I told her from now on, don't bother me like this. Right?

1034
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,159
She said that's fine, then let me hug you.

1035
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:14,660
After the hug, I'll let go from then on.

1036
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,039
Then I thought since we're friends, a hug is just a hug, nothing's wrong with that.

1037
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,519
Then I thought since we're friends, a hug is just a hug, nothing's wrong with that.

1038
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:19,939
A hug is a hug, and nothing's wrong?

1039
00:56:19,939 --> 00:56:21,399
Well… Look. After the hug,

1040
00:56:21,399 --> 00:56:23,360
Well… Look. After the hug,

1041
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,799
from then on, she will never

1042
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,500
from then on, she will never

1043
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,639
want to interfere in our relationship again.

1044
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:28,679
want to interfere in our relationship again.

1045
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:29,719
I think it's fine.

1046
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,239
Besides, it's not me hugging her. It's her hugging me.

1047
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:34,700
What if she didn't ask you to hug her?

1048
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,640
If she asked you to kiss her, would you kiss her?

1049
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,860
No, what?

1050
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:42,740
What kind of question is that?

1051
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,860
It's like you're asking me,

1052
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,360
if my mother and you fell into the water at the same time, who would I save first?

1053
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,580
if my mother and you fell
into the water at the same time, who would I save first?

1054
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,248
Let's put it this way.

1055
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,939
If one day, she kidnaps you,

1056
00:56:52,939 --> 00:56:54,880
If one day, she kidnaps you,

1057
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,679
the condition is I must kiss her; otherwise, she'll kill you.

1058
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:57,719
the condition is I must kiss her; otherwise, she'll kill you.

1059
00:56:57,719 --> 00:56:59,020
What do you think I should do?

1060
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,580
Then I would definitely kiss her, without hesitation.

1061
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,720
Then I would definitely kiss her, without hesitation.

1062
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,039
Xu Ziquan, you're really narcissistic.

1063
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:04,700
Xu Ziquan, you're really narcissistic.

1064
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,580
You could even imagine a day someone would commit a crime for you.

1065
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,800
You could even imagine a day someone would commit a crime for you.

1066
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,224
It might happen.

1067
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:14,880
Confess.

1068
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,000
What other fish are there in your pond that I don't know about?

1069
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,600
What other fish are there in your pond that I don't know about?

1070
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,259
Explain them all at once.

1071
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:25,559
If you call the old me a pond owner, I won't deny it.

1072
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:26,760
If you call the old me a pond owner, I won't deny it.

1073
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,440
But now I'm just a tank owner.

1074
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,440
In this small fish tank, there's only one fish, and that's you. All right?

1075
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,059
In this small fish tank, there's only one fish, and that's you. All right?

1076
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,679
What about you? Huh?

1077
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,499
Do you like me?

1078
00:57:42,499 --> 00:57:44,900
Or your moonlight?

1079
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,359
In that case,

1080
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,240
your question is not rigorous enough.

1081
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,579
your question is not rigorous enough.

1082
00:57:56,579 --> 00:57:57,960
What do you mean?

1083
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,000
I don't even know if you're asking for a vertical comparison

1084
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,100
I don't even know if you're asking for a vertical comparison

1085
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,180
I don't even know if you're asking for a vertical comparison

1086
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,400
or a horizontal one.

1087
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,440
These two are different?

1088
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,579
Of course, they're not the same.

1089
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:10,079
If it's a vertical comparison,

1090
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,920
it means looking at my entire life, who I like more.

1091
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,280
it means looking at my entire life, who I like more.

1092
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,060
Then I have to intercept the highest value I like in different periods and compare this value.

1093
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,320
Then I have to intercept the highest value I like in different periods and compare this value.

1094
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,220
Then I have to intercept the highest value I like in different periods and compare this value.

1095
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,280
Only then could I know who I like more.

1096
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,160
Only then could I know who I like more.

1097
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,519
But if it's a horizontal comparison, that is asking if I like you or him now.

1098
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:25,720
But if it's a horizontal comparison, that is asking if I like you or him now.

1099
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,840
And the answer is definite. Of course, I like you.

1100
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,519
That's more like it.

1101
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:31,580
When will your vertical result come out?

1102
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:34,059
The vertical comparison is a complex question,

1103
00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:36,660
and I can't figure it out in a short while.

1104
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,719
After all, so far,

1105
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,659
I don't know which moment I like you the most.

1106
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:44,880
I don't know which moment I like you the most.

1107
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:48,740
You haven't figured it out now. Right?

1108
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,350
No.

1109
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,900
Because all I know is that...

1110
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:02,019
every day in my future,

1111
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,619
I will love you more and more.

1112
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,519
You, Tang Ying, you really are a lawyer.

1113
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:12,840
Killing it in every angle, are we?

1114
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,979
You're quite eloquent.

1115
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:17,760
All right, I'm not angry anymore. You can't be mad at me either.

1116
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,980
How could it be the same?

1117
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,760
I am completely different from you.

1118
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,680
Normally, those romances of yours,

1119
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,240
Miss Five, Miss Six, and Miss Cui, whatsoever.

1120
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,860
- I just…
- Miss Cui?

1121
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,599
- Miss Five and Six?
- I'm turning a blind eye.

1122
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:28,840
I won't bother with them anymore.

1123
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,519
But today, it was too much.

1124
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:32,160
She was literally in your arms.

1125
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,320
I can let it go,

1126
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,640
but if I don't care about this,

1127
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,320
I would be a person with no principles.

1128
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,360
I see. In this case,

1129
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,080
let's solve this issue once and for all. Okay?

1130
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,519
There's no one on this phone,

1131
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,980
only family, friends, and you.

1132
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,479
This, a work phone,

1133
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:52,240
many people, mixed people.

1134
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,619
- Scootch over.
- Are you sure?

1135
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:57,280
I must do this anyway.

1136
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,460
Come on, let's see.

1137
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,180
A'Qiu, delete.

1138
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,780
A'Lin, delete.

1139
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,780
Who is this person Yun?

1140
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:08,104
Yun is an accountant.

1141
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,400
I don't remember, delete.

1142
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,764
Okay.

1143
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:15,080
All right, continue.

1144
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,019
You still have Peach on your list?

1145
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:19,800
Can you delete her?

1146
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,780
Okay, I'll delete her right away.

1147
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,160
The first thing to check in here is all the fruits.

1148
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,579
Delete all the fruit names.

1149
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:28,508
Okay, okay.

1150
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:31,360
Actually, sometimes I feel very blessed. You know that, right?

1151
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,099
Actually, sometimes I feel very blessed. You know that, right?

1152
01:00:34,579 --> 01:00:37,499
I just feel, in this vast sea of people,

1153
01:00:37,499 --> 01:00:40,720
you are the only one who is most tolerant of me.

1154
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,800
Tell me about it.

1155
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,459
No, you're a bit better than me.

1156
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:46,770
Think about it.

1157
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:50,180
You are Xu the Bodhisattva,

1158
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,579
helping so many people through their calamities.

1159
01:00:52,579 --> 01:00:55,019
No, you're teasing me again. Right?

1160
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:56,400
The sarcasm never ends.

1161
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,940
Right? Shall I continue deleting?

1162
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,199
- No, no, no.
- I'll continue deleting.

1163
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:01,199
- Just kidding. Let's be serious.
- No, no.

1164
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,679
- No, I have to.
- I want to share my feelings with you.

1165
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:05,219
I had my wisdom teeth removed today. Have you had your wisdom teeth removed?

1166
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:08,419
I don't have wisdom teeth and I have all my teeth.

1167
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:11,080
The wisdom tooth was hurting me so much.

1168
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,920
But when I suddenly needed to extract it today,

1169
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,620
I was a bit reluctant to let it go.

1170
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,679
Strange, isn't it?

1171
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:19,480
I just felt, after all, it's been with me for so long.

1172
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,440
I just felt, after all, it's been with me for so long.

1173
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,579
At that moment, I realized

1174
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:27,780
it's quite hard for people to make up their minds...

1175
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,220
it's quite hard for people to make up their minds...

1176
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,900
and say goodbye to the past.

1177
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,280
It's indeed not easy.

1178
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,220
But compared to losing you,

1179
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:48,520
what are these things worth. Right?

1180
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:50,860
Continue?

1181
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,539
- No more.
- I'll continue.

1182
01:01:52,539 --> 01:01:54,179
No more. I mean it.

1183
01:01:54,179 --> 01:01:56,300
Why bother with it on such a good night?

1184
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,220
What a waste.

1185
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,948
You're right.

1186
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,979
Don't tease me.

1187
01:02:05,494 --> 01:02:08,386

01:03:42,675 --> 01:03:47,232
♫ No longer afraid to face the midnight alone ♫

1214
01:03:47,232 --> 01:03:50,117
♫ The most romantic thing ♫

1215
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:52,965
♫ Is to waste time ♫

1216
01:03:52,965 --> 01:03:57,300
♫ With you ♫

1217
01:03:58,929 --> 01:04:02,418
♫ Each of our days ♫

1218
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:05,254
♫ Is worth commemorating ♫

1219
01:04:05,254 --> 01:04:09,857
♫ Until time pieces together every detail ♫

1220
01:04:09,857 --> 01:04:12,922
♫ Because of you ♫

1221
01:04:12,922 --> 01:04:15,586
♫ Because of you ♫
