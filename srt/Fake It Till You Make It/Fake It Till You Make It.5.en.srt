00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:05,899
What do you want to eat?

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:07,308
Anything is fine.

3
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:08,064
How about a barbecue? I know a good place.

4
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:09,088
How about a barbecue? I know a good place.

5
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:11,436
I wanted to take you there.

6
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:13,780
Sure, I'll follow your lead.

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,464
What's wrong?

8
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:17,180
Nothing.

9
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,640
When women hide their true feelings,

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,220
most of the time, it's to express discontent.

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,840
Being straightforward beats making others guess.

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,799
The delicate makeup shows her respect for this date.

13
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:27,400
But the smell of barbecue is not so friendly

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,760
But the smell of barbecue is not so friendly

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,240
to her long hair and her raglan sweater.

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,380
to her long hair and her raglan sweater.

17
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,252
You don't know what I want at all.

18
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:35,584
Wait for me.

19
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,760
Don't touch me.

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,159
Wouldn't it be better just to say no?

21
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,100
Now you have to hand the initiative over to others,

22
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,560
unsatisfied with their answers, and you're unhappy yourself.

23
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,960
unsatisfied with their answers, and you're unhappy yourself.

24
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,780
Why bother?

25
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,648
Giving you the right to choose

26
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,820
doesn't mean you can only consider yourself.

27
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,480
So sometimes, boys are indeed too blunt.

28
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,288
So sometimes, boys are indeed too blunt.

29
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:55,620
If you don't say, how am I supposed to know?

30
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,040
If this continues,

31
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,880
this girl might miss a very romantic plan.

32
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,419
this girl might miss a very romantic plan.

33
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,176
What she really wants is not a momentary touch,

34
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:08,440
but a lasting consideration in the details.

35
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,659
but a lasting consideration in the details.

36
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:12,600
The advantage of watching others in love is that

37
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,360
no matter how unbearable the hardship is,

38
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,979
you don't have to experience it yourself.

39
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,799
So, they think they are in love,

40
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,979
but they don't really understand what the other wants.

41
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:32,079
Why are you here?

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,380
Why can't I be here?

43
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,280
- I'll get some food.
- I'll buy the drinks.

44
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,239
- I'll get some food.
- I'll buy the drinks.

45
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,320
Hurry up, everyone. We're running out of eggs.

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,400
Hurry up, everyone. We're running out of eggs.

47
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,879
Once we're sold out, we're closing up.

48
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,640
I want a double-egg pancake.

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,920
No onions, but coriander.

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
- No fruit, but crispy.
- Okay.

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,339
Hello, is mine ready yet?

52
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:51,588
You're back.

53
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:53,220
- Here's your double-egg pancake.
- Thank you.

54
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,872
- No onions, but coriander. Right?
- Yes.

55
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:57,319
Did you two come together?

56
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,680
Why do you have the exact same order?

57
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:20,220
How much is it?

58
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:38,772
It's on me.

59
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,699
Wait for me.

60
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,136
Don't touch me.

61
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,960
- I'm sorry. I was wrong.
- Don't touch me.

62
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,608
Don't be angry.

63
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,976
- Don't be angry.
- Only this time.

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,368
Let's go.

65
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:05,988
Let's have a drink, come on.

66
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:07,372
Come on.

[Episode 5]

69
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:10,159
Enjoy your meal.

70
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,496
Thank you. By the way, how do we join the competition?

71
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:14,460
Thank you. By the way, how do we join the competition?

72
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,480
Just leave your name.

73
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,512
- Can the two of us join together?
- No problem, I'll get the drinks.

74
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,712
- Can the two of us join together?
- No problem, I'll get the drinks.

75
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:22,744
Here we go.

76
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,588
Go ahead.

77
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:29,472
Okay, thank you.

78
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:32,560
I finally understand why the first place only drank five cups.

79
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,680
I finally understand why the first place only drank five cups.

80
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,076
Come on. Are we still toasting?

81
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,260
Come on. Are we still toasting?

82
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,600
Forget it. No more. Come on.

83
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:22,792
Have you ever heard a saying?

84
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:25,088
The first time is a coincidence,

85
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:27,040
The first time is a coincidence,

86
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,040
the second is a fluke,

87
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,708
and the third time is fate.

88
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,879
and the third time is fate.

89
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,139
Are you hinting...

90
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,404
that you are my destiny?

91
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:50,800
What I want to tell you is

92
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,304
our unexpected encounters and shared interests

93
00:05:53,304 --> 00:05:55,484
our unexpected encounters and shared interests...

94
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:59,659
may mean that we have already

95
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,972
been running on the same track.

96
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:19,768
No.

97
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:26,140
What same track?

98
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,680
Let me explain to you.

99
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,320
This only means the CBD circle... is too small.

100
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,160
This only means the CBD circle... is too small.

101
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,060
You're a terrifying woman.

102
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,399
How am I terrifying?

103
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,620
I'm not terrifying at all.

104
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,868
What do you want... to do now?

105
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,928
What do you want... to do now?

106
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:47,428
What do you want to do the most?

107
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:51,460
What I want to do the most...

108
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:56,480
Of course,

109
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:04,068
is... to... work...

on the Walrus case with you.

111
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,820
Did you know that WFC has a secret passage?

112
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
I've never told anyone about it.

113
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,460
You can go up to the roof from there and overlook the entire CBD,

114
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,439
You can go up to the roof from there and overlook the entire CBD,

115
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,459
but no one knows what I'm looking at.

116
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:31,268
I'll take you there when you finish the case.

117
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:33,772
All right, deal.

118
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:35,976
Once this is done,

119
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:38,920
we'll celebrate at the place you mentioned.

120
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,152
Xu,

121
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:47,452
you have to strive to do well, you know?

122
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:49,128
Finish it.

123
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:50,916
This is yours too.

124
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:54,800
As one grows older, do we always start to cherish past achievements?

125
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,820
As one grows older, do we always start to cherish past achievements?

126
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:01,476
Look at this trophy.

127
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:04,964
It's the 2009 Investment Banker Jun Ding Award.

128
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:08,079
That year, I had just returned to Beijing from Wall Street.

129
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,819
Nobody knew me,

130
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:11,519
and they thought I only came to Beijing because I was struggling in America.

131
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,679
and they thought I only came to Beijing because I was struggling in America.

132
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:16,768
They didn't expect me to make such an impressive achievement in the first year.

133
00:08:17,572 --> 00:08:19,524
And this one,

134
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:22,020
the 2014 Golden Spectrum Award.

135
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,900
That year, I had just divorced my ex-wife.

136
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,396
Heartbroken,

137
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:31,199
but surprisingly, I made some achievements in my career.

138
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,780
It's because you work hard enough, and are outstanding enough.

139
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,064
It's because you work hard enough, and are outstanding enough.

140
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:38,044
In investment banking, opportunity is very important.

141
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:40,748
In investment banking, opportunity is very important.

142
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:43,600
Elvis, in this year's industry annual meeting,

143
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,100
any awards for those under 35,

144
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,280
I've already submitted the application and got the nomination for you.

145
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:52,220
You deserve it.

146
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,220
You've done very well with the Walrus case.

147
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,500
The next step is the key.

148
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,560
If you can facilitate this transaction

149
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,940
and establish long-term cooperation with Wanguo,

150
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,939
your future will be more excellent than mine.

151
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:05,760
your future will be more excellent than mine.

152
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:07,912

153
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:10,432
Richard, thank you.

154
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:12,420
Afterwards, I'll completely delegate to you.

155
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,424
Sign the consulting contract with Wanguo as soon as possible.

156
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:17,076
Understood.

157
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,100
Miss Tang, Mr. Zheng wants you in his office.

158
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,168
Okay, got it.

159
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:35,684
Mr. Zheng, you asked for me?

160
00:09:35,684 --> 00:09:37,960
Guo, leave us for now.

161
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,700
Okay, let me know if you need anything.

162
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,879
Tang, how's the progress on the Walrus project?

163
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,039
Why aren't you reporting to the firm?

164
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,700
Without Miss Wang, are you having trouble adjusting?

165
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,936
Without Miss Wang, are you having trouble adjusting?

166
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:53,320
Mr. Zheng, I'm really sorry for not reporting to you in time.

167
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,660
Mr. Zheng, I'm really sorry for not reporting to you in time.

168
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,260
But it's because there are some problems I haven't figured out yet.

169
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,559
But it's because there are some problems I haven't figured out yet.

170
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,136
What kind of problems are they?

171
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:01,656
Tell me.

172
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:05,819
Walrus is an Internet company,

173
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:07,060
but most of their executives don't have a background in tech.

174
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,200
but most of their executives don't have a background in tech.

175
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,919
They all started by managing funds.

176
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,159
They are a typical company that dives into any hot industry.

177
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,980
They are a typical company that dives into any hot industry.

178
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,528
Also, I found that their chairman often visits Macau.

179
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:20,480
- That…
- They have a Legal Affairs Department,

180
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,520
- That…
- They have a Legal Affairs Department,

181
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,820
and the risks are under control.

182
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,880
Yes, I know. But as you also know, he has been emphasizing

183
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,140
Yes, I know. But as you also know, he has been emphasizing

184
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,060
Yes, I know. But as you also know, he has been emphasizing

185
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,940
the compensation for when something happens,

186
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,832
and he demands us to keep the fees within their acceptable range.

187
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,560
and he demands us to keep the fees within their acceptable range.

188
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,864
They didn't say they won't do what the law doesn't allow.

189
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:40,760
Their creed is that nothing can stand in money's way.

190
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,660
This idea is very dangerous.

191
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,740
This idea is very dangerous.

192
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,672
Then you might as well suggest that they terminate this acquisition.

193
00:10:49,768 --> 00:10:51,760
Of course, that's not what I mean.

194
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,560
I understand that my duty is just to send out risk warnings.

195
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,100
I understand that my duty is just to send out risk warnings.

196
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,160
Other things are not my responsibility or under my control.

197
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,980
Other things are not my responsibility or under my control.

198
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,096
Other things are not my responsibility or under my control.

199
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:24,664
Miss Han.

200
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:40,032
You've always been specializing in intellectual property.

201
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:43,859
I took a case and I need a lawyer specializing in intellectual property to assist me.

202
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:47,184
I took a case and I need a lawyer specializing in intellectual property to assist me.

203
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,039
Other lawyers specializing in that field are all busy,

204
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,144
so after thinking about it, you're the most suitable choice.

205
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,980
so after thinking about it, you're the most suitable choice.

206
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:00,879
Tang Ying,

207
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,820
a team is crucial for a lawyer,

208
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,064
and fighting alone will be tough.

209
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:22,364
Thank you, Miss Han.

210
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,460
But the case I am currently working on

211
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,360
was just assigned by Mr. Zheng,

212
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,140
and he asked me to handle it alone.

213
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,860
So I was thinking, I have to make some progress on it.

214
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,039
So I was thinking, I have to make some progress on it.

215
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:36,039
I can't let Mr. Zheng down. Right?

216
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,360
M&A is not your strong suit.

217
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,539
Can you handle it?

218
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:42,080
Indeed, I haven't handled many transactional cases before,

219
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,840
Indeed, I haven't handled many transactional cases before,

220
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,979
but I've taken a look and it's not very complex.

221
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:46,880
but I've taken a look and it's not very complex.

222
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,700
I think I can handle it.

223
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,020
All right, keep it up.

224
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,324
Thank you.

225
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:02,176
Let's all work hard.

226
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:04,900
All right, Miss Han.

227
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:26,299
Hello, Professor Zhang.

228
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:28,659
I just got off work.

229
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:30,559
I'm near Guomao.

230
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:32,920
Sure.

231
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,492
I'll come to you.

232
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:37,012
Okay.

233
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,856
Busy lately?

234
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:48,540
Quite busy.

235
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,536
The weather has been good recently,

236
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:03,960
with less smog.

237
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,456
Yes.

238
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,900
What-What do you want to eat?

239
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,496
I'm good with anything.

240
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:18,048
Then, let's look around.

241
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,180
What-What kind of cuisine do you like?

242
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,236
I'm good with anything.

243
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:37,288
Let's do this one, this one.

244
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:39,220
Okay, okay. This one.

245
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,028
Welcome.

246
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:42,648
All right.

247
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:49,280
Professor Zhang,

248
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,272
the last time I met you,

249
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:54,679
I didn't know you were coming.

250
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:57,572
I thought it would be just me and Mrs. Meiling.

251
00:14:57,572 --> 00:14:59,912
Actually, I didn't know either.

252
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:02,144
I thought she was joking about introducing me to a girlfriend.

253
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:03,320
I thought she was joking about introducing me to a girlfriend.

254
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,440
I didn't expect you to really come.

255
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:11,400
You guys are close. Right?

256
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,600
We grew up together. Despite my being younger than her,

257
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,879
We grew up together. Despite my being younger than her,

258
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,400
I used to take care of her when we were kids. And we were…

259
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,372
I used to take care of her when we were kids. And we were…

260
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:20,919
we were quite close.

261
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,640
Then she got married,

262
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,260
but at that time I was abroad.

263
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,919
It's only these two years that we've been in more contact.

264
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,220
She would send me WeChat messages at night.

265
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,919
Probably due to the time difference,

266
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,240
when she can't sleep at night, I'm usually the least busy in the lab.

267
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,240
when she can't sleep at night, I'm usually the least busy in the lab.

268
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,600
It could also be because we're getting older, we tend to reminisce about our childhood.

269
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,880
It could also be because we're getting older, we tend to reminisce about our childhood.

270
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,320
Both of us have exceptional memories,

271
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,140
and we remember our childhood very clearly.

272
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,200
For instance, the first time I made her cry,

273
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,368
I said she was wearing a red mini-skirt.

274
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:48,192
She insisted that she wasn't, instead, she was wearing a blue pair of shorts.

275
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:50,320
She insisted that she wasn't, instead, she was wearing a blue pair of shorts.

276
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,800
We could argue about such things for hours.

277
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,340
Hello, here's your dish.

278
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,280
And then this year, I came back and I found that she hadn't changed at all.

279
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,840
And then this year, I came back and I found that she hadn't changed at all.

280
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,020
She was exactly the same as when we were kids, always a little girl at heart.

281
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,180
She was exactly the same as when we were kids, always a little girl at heart.

282
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,639
You know she's quite naughty.

283
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:06,028
To my surprise, as soon as I mention Liu Meiling,

284
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:09,680
Zhang Yiwen could keep going on about her,

285
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,352
like a heartfelt, lonely, and boring stand-up comedy.

286
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:15,752
What's gotten into him?

287
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:17,880
He has feelings for Liu Meiling?

288
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,260
The consulting contract with Wanguo has finally been drafted,

289
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,076
but this is just the beginning.

290
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:29,399
They intend to expand the domestic market,

291
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,759
and this merger and acquisition could be an experiment.

292
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,500
As long as we can successfully sign with Walrus,

293
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,480
the following projects will be easy to negotiate.

294
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,640
So, we must secure this. Understand?

295
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,348
Don't worry, boss.

296
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:43,296
- Feeling tired?
- I'm not tired, I'm fine.

297
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:45,604
- Feeling tired?
- I'm not tired, I'm fine.

298
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,500
Recently, we've been staying up late working on proposals,

299
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,959
so we're not going to work overtime today.

300
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,180
You should go home and rest.

301
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,260
All right, boss. I'll leave first.

302
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,532
Brother Hao, take care.

303
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:58,076
By the way, there's a mild liquor brand recently that's been doing well in the market.

304
00:16:58,076 --> 00:16:59,240
By the way, there's amild liquor brand recently that's been doing well in the market.

305
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,940
Should we arrange a meeting?

306
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,152
Mild liquor?

307
00:17:02,152 --> 00:17:03,720
The kind of fruit wine girls love?

308
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,699
Yes.

309
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,000
There are so many brands now, can the girls keep up with drinking?

310
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,260
There are so many brands now, can the girls keep up with drinking?

311
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,744
Let's talk about us instead.

312
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:15,559
You're single, and I'm single too.

313
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:18,960
And Meiling brought us together.

314
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:25,796
Would you like to try being with me? Tang Ying.

315
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:28,120
Would you like to try being with me? Tang Ying.

316
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:32,772
Good evening, sir. Would you like to see the menu?

317
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,168
That nerd isn't right for you.

318
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:08,000
Hey, where are you?

319
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,920
I'm here having dinner with a friend,

320
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,699
and I saw you on a date.

321
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,180
You're on a date too, huh?

322
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,844
With which pretty girl?

323
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,444
I don't remember.

324
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:19,780
All I remember now is you.

325
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,900
- Are you still at Guomao?
- Yes, I just got off the elevator.

326
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,539
- Are you still at Guomao?
- Yes, I just got off the elevator.

327
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:24,220
Stay put. Don't move.

328
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,800
I'll come to you.

329
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,559
In such a rush to see me?

330
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,780
I ate too much,

331
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,000
and I command you to take a walk with me

332
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,076
and fulfill your duty as a friend.

333
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:46,940
I just had dinner with a colleague,

334
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,340
and I saw you having a romantic incident.

335
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,980
What romantic incident?

336
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,319
It was a disaster.

337
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,228
Would you like to try being with me? Tang Ying.

338
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:56,012
Would you like to try being with me? Tang Ying.

339
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:03,616
No.

340
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:11,868
Professor Zhang,

341
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,452
do you know why I've been single all these years?

342
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:20,988
do you know why I've been single all these years?

343
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,124
It's because I don't want to just try things out with someone.

344
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:27,240
It's because I don't want to just try things out with someone.

345
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:31,400
Are you in a hurry to get married?

346
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,940
No, no. I… I'm not in a hurry.

347
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,984
I… I just thought...

348
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,259
our acquaintance is also a kind of fate. Right?

349
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:43,784
And it was Meiling who brought us together.

350
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,939
I think Mrs. Meiling wasn't sincerely

351
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:49,016
trying to set you up with someone.

352
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:52,832
Do you remember after we had dinner that day, we added each other on WeChat?

353
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:54,316
Do you remember after we had dinner that day, we added each other on WeChat?

354
00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:55,072
Do you remember after we had dinner that day, we added each other on WeChat?

355
00:19:55,072 --> 00:19:56,800
When you added me on WeChat,

356
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,219
I clearly saw Mrs. Meiling giving me a fierce glare.

357
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,939
I clearly saw Mrs. Meiling giving me a fierce glare.

358
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,360
I was quite puzzled at the time, wondering why she was so unhappy.

359
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,140
I was quite puzzled at the time, wondering why she was so unhappy.

360
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,799
Also, the way she looks at you is very different.

361
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,044
Also, the way she looks at you is very different.

362
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,599
If the two of you are clearly attracted to each other,

363
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,808
If the two of you are clearly attracted to each other,

364
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,119
why involve me?

365
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:25,552
What makes you think we're attracted to each other?

366
00:20:25,552 --> 00:20:28,556
She-She's already married.

367
00:20:28,556 --> 00:20:31,120
Tang Ying, it's not good for her reputation to say that about her.

368
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,820
It's Tang Ying.

369
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,944
You got the intonation wrong.

370
00:20:38,216 --> 00:20:39,928
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,920
First of all, if she really was trying to set me up with anyone,

372
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,800
First of all, if she really was trying to set me up with anyone,

373
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,340
she wouldn't have kept it from me.

374
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,720
She didn't tell me in advance, and I was completely unprepared.

375
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,992
She didn't tell me in advance, and I was completely unprepared.

376
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:50,879
The way she looks at you is very different.

377
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:53,820
The way she looks at you is very different.

378
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,279
She cares a lot about you.

379
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,680
You asked me out for dinner today,

380
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,840
and you asked me if I wanted to try being with you.

381
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,199
But before that, 90% of your conversation was about her.

382
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:04,020
But before that, 90% of your conversation was about her.

383
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,760
But before that, 90% of your conversation was about her.

384
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
She's all you can think of.

385
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,212
You clearly like her.

386
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,884
It's not liking.

387
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:24,380
It's love.

388
00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:28,480
I love her.

389
00:21:31,044 --> 00:21:34,728
And if I can't be with her in the end,

390
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:35,864
then I might as well try being with someone she chose for me.

391
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:40,260
then I might as well try being with someone she chose for me.

392
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,119
I've thought it through.

393
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,159
I accept all the endings she gives me.

394
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:48,580
I accept all the endings she gives me.

395
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,472
He's nursing a secret crush and wants to drag me into accepting his fate.

396
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:52,159
He's nursing a secret crush and wants to drag me into accepting his fate.

397
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,000
Why should I accept his fate? Don't you agree?

398
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,504
Why should I accept his fate? Don't you agree?

399
00:21:56,504 --> 00:21:57,864
It makes sense.

400
00:21:57,864 --> 00:22:00,420
If I were a girl, I'd be angry too.

401
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,260
Perhaps I'd even beat him up.

402
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:03,959
If you were a girl, you'd also be a menace too.

403
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:07,659
If you were a girl, you'd also be a menace too.

404
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:11,739
What do you mean by "also"?

405
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,699
Who was the one before me?

406
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,979
I don't know, certainly it wasn't me.

407
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:17,760
Then, who have I menaced?

408
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,000
You know perfectly in your heart.

409
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,268
Does that include you?

410
00:22:33,672 --> 00:22:36,132
Hello, where are you headed?

411
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:37,680
To the bar at 1605.

412
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,799
They're closed for renovation. They won't reopen until next month.

413
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,640
They're closed for renovation. They won't reopen until next month.

414
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,524
So what do we do?

415
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,476
How about we try a different one? It's not far.

416
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:47,140
Never mind.

417
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,120
Two more blocks and I'll be home.

418
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,200
Besides, I have to work overtime. I'll drink at home.

419
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,039
Besides, I have to work overtime. I'll drink at home.

420
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,560
Wait for me, just a moment.

421
00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:58,524
Your boyfriend is quite handsome.

422
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,860
Just a friend, but thank you.

423
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,416
Stay safe.

424
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:06,616
All right.

425
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:17,144
I'm back.

426
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:21,000
I wanted to have a drink with you, but it didn't work out.

427
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,220
I wanted to have a drink with you, but it didn't work out.

428
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,900
I brought some snacks and beer.

429
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,304
You can have them while working overtime.

430
00:23:30,024 --> 00:23:32,552
Isn't it just two blocks? I'll walk you home.

431
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:35,820
All right. Since you're the handsome guy, you make the decisions.

432
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,000
Isn't that something you should say after drinking

433
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,559
so that it's more convincing?

434
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,880
Well, my eyes are not sharp and I didn't notice it all along.

435
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,220
Well, my eyes are not sharp and I didn't notice it all along.

436
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,699
Someone just pointed it out to me.

437
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:45,219
Really? Which way?

438
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:46,976
This way.

439
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,048
We didn't get to drink.

440
00:24:00,968 --> 00:24:02,456
Look.

441
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:09,939
Xinzi.

442
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:12,160
Do you know that boy?

443
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,724
I know him, Xu Jiabai.

444
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:16,512
They're really into it.

445
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,408
Stop looking.

446
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,160
You won't be able to get home for a while.

447
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,600
Let's go; take another walk.

448
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,860
How did they get together so quickly?

449
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,552
What? You're not happy?

450
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,072
I've seen Xu Jiabai.

451
00:24:39,072 --> 00:24:41,400
I think he's very pretentious,

452
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,968
and in a very tasteless way.

453
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,680
He's not good enough for my sister. My sister is so beautiful.

454
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,616
He's not good enough for my sister. My sister is so beautiful.

455
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,839
Have you ever considered when you find someone pretentious,

456
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:51,980
Have you ever considered when you find someone pretentious,

457
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,440
it means they are not skillful enough?

458
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,959
Perhaps, she also wanted to find someone with style,

459
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:59,519
but she didn't notice Xu Jiabai was pretending.

460
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,420
So, this is a comparison.

461
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,480
As long as she likes him, it's fine.

462
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,796
Then you're done.

463
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,499
I think you've got some style.

464
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:11,319
That means your taste is not bad.

465
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,259
It's also possible that I haven't seen your flaw.

466
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,600
Look. If my sister does like someone with style,

467
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,964
aren't you much better than Xu Jiabai?

468
00:25:24,964 --> 00:25:27,900
Why didn't she have an eye for you?

469
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,419
Didn't you say he cares a lot for your sister?

470
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,732
So, what's the nemesis of a delicate little princess?

471
00:25:37,732 --> 00:25:39,220
What?

472
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:48,292
By the way, how is the acquisition between Walrus and Wanguo progressing?

473
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:50,559
I'm waiting for this case to start.

474
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,908
It's just one step away from signing a contract with Wanguo.

475
00:25:52,908 --> 00:25:54,380
Keep it up.

476
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,500
You're back.

477
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,056
Xinzi, come and sit.

478
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:26,740
Sit here. I have a question.

479
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,340
Sit here. I have a question.

480
00:26:33,784 --> 00:26:36,260
What's the matter?

481
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,380
Are you hiding something from me?

482
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:45,472
You know it all.

483
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,036
As soon as I got off work, on my way home,

484
00:26:51,036 --> 00:26:55,340
I saw two lovebirds who couldn't help themselves.

485
00:26:57,344 --> 00:26:59,380
If it snowed a little,

486
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,960
it would make a perfect picture.

487
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,720
Stop. Stop it.

488
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,379
How long has it been?

489
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:06,720
Actually, it hasn't been long.

490
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:12,200
Remember when he bought my not-so-important stuff?

491
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,648
Then I thought, I should be nicer to him.

492
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:19,019
As a result, he was very eager to confirm the relationship with me.

493
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:21,000
Well, for me, you know?

494
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,899
I don't like being forced by others.

495
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:26,279
At that time, I thought it probably wouldn't work for us,

496
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,836
and there was a little regret.

497
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:31,900
- Until one day…
- There is a problem with this aesthetics.

498
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,119
- Until one day…
- There is a problem with this aesthetics.

499
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,400
You must tell him tomorrow.

500
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,416
- Really, don't…
- I'm planning to say something.

501
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,132
Xinzi.

502
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:42,039
Why don't you go ahead? I will come to find you later.

503
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,028
Why don't you go ahead? I will come to find you later.

504
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:47,160
What are you doing here?

505
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,196
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

506
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:49,984
I will take you to eat something delicious. And then, after work today, I'll…

507
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:51,160
I will take you to eat something delicious. And then, after work today, I'll…

508
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,720
No, I don't like such surprises.

509
00:27:55,012 --> 00:27:56,759
I don't want to keep my friend waiting.

510
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,184
If you'll excuse me.

511
00:27:58,184 --> 00:28:00,720
Then it got pretty unpleasant.

512
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,820
Later, his sister called me.

513
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,939
Later, his sister called me.

514
00:28:05,939 --> 00:28:09,188
- Hello.
- Hi, is this Xinzi?

515
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,048
I'm sorry to bother you.

516
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:12,932
It's just...

517
00:28:12,932 --> 00:28:15,259
It's just that my brother is in the hospital.

518
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:17,040
What happened?

519
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,639
He's been drinking heavily these days.

520
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:21,680
He doesn't go to work and keeps asking for leave.

521
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,019
He has a weak stomach.

522
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,480
He had sudden gastric bleeding last night and ended up in the hospital.

523
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,636
He had sudden gastric bleeding last night and ended up in the hospital.

524
00:28:26,636 --> 00:28:29,019
Hello. Could you tell me how to find bed number 27?

525
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:30,820
Just a moment.

526
00:28:38,152 --> 00:28:39,904
Xinzi?

527
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:44,340
What are you doing here?

528
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,480
I brought you pig stomach chicken soup.

529
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,460
They say you replenish what you consume.

530
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,468
Have it while it's hot.

531
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:58,808
Did you have fun that day...

532
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:01,984
eating with your friend?

533
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:05,159
Why are you asking this?

534
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,132
I was quite upset anyway.

535
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,632
Each time I think about you guys, laughing and talking,

536
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,920
I feel so envious.

537
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,520
I wish I was that person.

538
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,196
I've never felt this way before.

539
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:26,076
This is the first time.

540
00:29:29,796 --> 00:29:32,772
Sis, I suddenly felt at that moment,

541
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,824
that this man really cared about me.

542
00:29:34,824 --> 00:29:37,540
He puts me first wholeheartedly.

543
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,219
To give him up like this,

544
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:42,184
wouldn't it be a bit foolish?

545
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,684
For these past few days, I've thought a lot too.

546
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:48,839
For these past few days, I've thought a lot too.

547
00:29:50,564 --> 00:29:53,284
Feelings can't be forced.

548
00:29:53,824 --> 00:29:57,476
So, I've decided...

549
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,680
that from today onward, I'll officially give up pursuing you.

550
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,912
that from today onward, I'll officially give up pursuing you.

551
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,939
It's not because I don't like you anymore,

552
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,519
but I just can't figure out

553
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,599
how to be better to you.

554
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,079
How to give all my love to you and cherish you.

555
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,484
How to give all my love to you and cherish you.

556
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:19,664
I want to devote all my time and energy to you.

557
00:30:20,512 --> 00:30:23,332
But it doesn't seem to make you happy.

558
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,960
It drives me crazy,

559
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:32,240
but I must accept it.

560
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,860
You're really great.

561
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,864
And you deserve someone much better than me.

562
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:41,960
And you deserve someone much better than me.

563
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,019
You'll definitely meet him.

564
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,620
Don't worry about me.

565
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,419
I'll be fine.

566
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,100
I'll always be here if you need me.

567
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,472
What if I never meet anyone better than you?

568
00:31:08,232 --> 00:31:12,639
Sis, I must find someone who treats me best.

569
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:15,100
Only then can I be happy.

570
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,552
Xu Jiabai has passed this test of mine.

571
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,960
You know, in idol dramas,

572
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,440
the guy always has to stay in the hospital for the girl at least once,

573
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,559
indicating that this guy loves this girl so much that he doesn't even mind risking his life.

574
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,356
indicating that this guy loves this girl so much that he doesn't even mind risking his life.

575
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:34,760
Isn't that a bit exaggerated?

576
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,060
How much can a man who doesn't even love himself love someone else?

577
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,044
How much can a man who doesn't even love himself love someone else?

578
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,660
But that's still better than someone who only loves themselves.

579
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:52,596
Tang Ying,

580
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,940
we have one thing in common.

581
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,319
You're right, Xu Ziquan,

582
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,699
we both only love ourselves.

583
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,300
♫ I'm falling... ♫

584
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:15,480
♫ I'm falling... ♫

585
00:32:15,488 --> 00:32:17,536
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

586
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,728
Elvis.

587
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:27,908
Are you sure Richard just letting us negotiate with Wanguo so easily?

588
00:32:27,908 --> 00:32:30,480
Haven't we done a clear due diligence check?

589
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,119
No, that's not what I'm worried about.

590
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,340
- I'm worried…
- Don't worry.

591
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,168
All right.

592
00:32:42,148 --> 00:32:44,019
- Ms. Xin.
- It's just the two of you.

593
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:45,220
- It's been a long time.
- Where's Richard?

594
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,844
- It's been a long time.
- Where's Richard?

595
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:50,280
This time, Richard left us in full charge.

596
00:32:51,368 --> 00:32:52,956
Take a seat.

597
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,500
I'll pay you later.

598
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,580
- Thank you.
- Please wait a moment.

599
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,632
Okay.

600
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,948
Why does it look so deserted recently?

601
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:13,200
Where's Mr. Dou? Isn't he coming anymore?

602
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,299
Aren't they busy with the case you're handling, too?

603
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,620
Hang in there, Miss Tang.

604
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,320
Smoothly handle the case you're working on

605
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,824
and thoroughly deflate their arrogance.

606
00:33:25,824 --> 00:33:28,699
Do you know how Han Han used you to educate us?

607
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:32,700
She said, 'Wang Yu is wise. It's like pulling a horse back from the edge of a cliff.'

608
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,260
Wang Yu had his reasons.

609
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,680
At least he should show some loyalty. Right?

610
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,599
That way, you wouldn't be doing all this work alone.

611
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:43,332
But, Miss Tang, I absolutely support you.

612
00:33:43,332 --> 00:33:44,839
If there's anything I can help with, just say it.

613
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,052
If there's anything I can help with, just say it.

614
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:48,560
Okay.

615
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:18,520
Amy, have you got the email from them?

616
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,200
Amy, have you got the email from them?

617
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,488
Yes.

618
00:34:24,736 --> 00:34:26,079
- After reviewing it, send it to them before 5:00.
- Okay.

619
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,480
- After reviewing it, send it to them before 5:00.
- Okay.

620
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,524
- Then reply to me as soon as possible.
- Okay.

621
00:34:31,524 --> 00:34:33,412
Ms. Xin! Ms. Xin!

622
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:36,412
Sister! Sister.

623
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:40,096
Take a look at the M&A proposal first.

624
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:42,880
Your MD's presence shows we can trust your company.

625
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,820
You coming alone, do you want me to trust you?

626
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,660
Sister! Sister! Trust me.

627
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,176
The intention of Walrus is basically clear.

628
00:34:50,176 --> 00:34:52,080
As long as this case is settled,

629
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,920
for Wanguo, whether it's market share or return on investment,

630
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,020
for Wanguo, whether it's market share or return on investment,

631
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,840
it will be very, very substantial.

632
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,060
Sister, it's worth a try, really.

633
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,180
Trust me, it's worth a try.

634
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,300
(Sister?)

635
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:28,152
The proposal for Wanguo has been submitted.

636
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:31,039
All yours, Miss Tang.

637
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:33,920
We must win.

638
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:19,460
Okay.

639
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,380
Let's refine the text a bit more.

640
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,199
Being able to pull off the first merger case like this,

641
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,988
Being able to pull off the first merger case like this,

642
00:36:25,988 --> 00:36:27,160
I'm really impressed.

643
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,760
Have you scheduled the signing time?

644
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,340
Yes, this afternoon.

645
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,032
In a moment, I'll review the contract again and then send it to you.

646
00:36:32,032 --> 00:36:33,099
In a moment, I'll review the contract again and then send it to you.

647
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:34,360
Can you handle it alone?

648
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,348
Do you need Guo Yu and Han Han to help you?

649
00:36:38,348 --> 00:36:39,599
No need to trouble them.

650
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,788
Besides, I have your support.

651
00:36:42,788 --> 00:36:45,900
By the way, the contract still needs several partners to sign.

652
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,260
Mr. Meng and Mr. Ban are on a business trip.

653
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,536
They can sign when they return.

654
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,160
Okay, then I'll leave it to you.

655
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,760
After this project is completed, I'll give you a holiday.

656
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,516
After this project is completed, I'll give you a holiday.

657
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:59,012
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

658
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,519
Okay, Xin Di, you can take over.

659
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,144
Mr. Ma.

660
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:27,960
Thank you.

661
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,652
Sister, thank you.

662
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:37,308
Keep it up.

663
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,328
We'll have to trouble Miss Tang a bit more.

664
00:37:47,328 --> 00:37:48,820
Thank you for your trust in us.

665
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,320
- We'll do our best on this case.
- Okay.

666
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,016
Thank you, we'll do our best.

667
00:37:57,864 --> 00:38:01,892
Boss, we have our year-end bonus settled now.

668
00:38:01,892 --> 00:38:03,868
- Get in the car.
- Okay.

669
00:38:49,032 --> 00:38:52,370
What are you doing? Why are you touching me?

670
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:54,980
It's been three times now.

671
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,719
- I didn't touch you.
- Playing dumb now?

672
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,880
You dare to do it but not admit it?

673
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,164
Do you have proof?

674
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:02,580
Did you see me touch you?

675
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,960
Get off and come to the police station with me.

676
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,639
Come with me.

677
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,452
Look at you.

678
00:39:07,452 --> 00:39:08,639
With that face, I wouldn't touch you even if you begged me to.

679
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,220
With that face, I wouldn't touch you even if you begged me to.

680
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,480
Why are you hitting people?

681
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,892
You have a foul mouth and deserve a smack.

682
00:39:14,892 --> 00:39:15,900
How could you…

683
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,608
You deserved it.

684
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:18,432
I've been sitting right here. What did you do?

685
00:39:18,432 --> 00:39:19,488
I've been sitting right here. What did you do?

686
00:39:19,488 --> 00:39:20,512
And your verbal abuse, we all saw it.

687
00:39:20,512 --> 00:39:22,479
And your verbal abuse, we all saw it.

688
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:24,440
I remember last week the subway molester was convicted of forcible indecency.

689
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,920
I remember last week the subway molester was convicted of forcible indecency.

690
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,944
It was trending. I guess you want to be a web celebrity, too. Huh?

691
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:29,184
It was trending. I guess you want to be a web celebrity, too. Huh?

692
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:31,392
Where are you going? Behave.

693
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,199
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

694
00:39:36,136 --> 00:39:37,000
- Stay put.
- Don't move.

695
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,980
- Stay put.
- Don't move.

696
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,000
Pervert.

697
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,700
We'll go to the police station later and make a statement.

698
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,020
Are you good?

699
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,092
Of course, yes.

Congratulations to Xu Ziquan.

888
00:51:29,572 --> 00:51:30,839
He was okay last year, but does he still deserve it this year?

889
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:32,859
He was okay last year, but does he still deserve it this year?

890
00:51:32,859 --> 00:51:35,760
I heard his boss was transferred

891
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,979
because of his mistake.

892
00:51:37,979 --> 00:51:39,560
The acquisition case of Wanguo was just signed before Walrus had bad news.

I didn't expect that today, I could still get this award.

This honor is not just mine.

900
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:08,660
It belongs to my team.

901
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,319
Recently someone asked me how I felt.

902
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,419
Recently someone asked me how I felt.

903
00:52:15,419 --> 00:52:16,620
From one to nine, how uncomfortable are you?

904
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:19,619
From one to nine, how uncomfortable are you?

905
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:20,880
And I told her, just one.

906
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,204
And I told her, just one.

907
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:26,468
Not because I was trying to be tough,

908
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:29,928
it's because of you,

909
00:52:29,928 --> 00:52:30,940
my nine points of frustration are not worth mentioning.

910
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,720
my nine points of frustration are not worth mentioning.

911
00:52:38,504 --> 00:52:39,979
Cheers.

912
00:52:39,979 --> 00:52:42,499

Great stuff. Let's thank Xu Ziquan again

917

for sharing his deep gratitude to the team.

918
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,972
Thank you.

919
00:53:01,972 --> 00:53:05,080
♫ You and I are always separated by this world ♫

920
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:10,780
Mr. Xu, we've seen each other before. You remember, right?

921
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,720
Of course, I've seen you in the industry.

922
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,400
We just talked inside.

923
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,000
Right.

924
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,400
- Mr. Xu, can I have your number?
- Yes, yes.

925
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,779
- My phone number is…
- Mr. Xu, do you remember me?

926
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:20,920
- My phone number is…
- Mr. Xu, do you remember me?

927
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,399
Of course, I do.

928
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,279
Mr. Xu.

929
00:53:24,279 --> 00:53:25,880
Wonderful speech.

930
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,808
Thank you, thank you.

931
00:53:27,808 --> 00:53:30,316
Why don't you help me get everyone's WeChat?

932
00:53:30,316 --> 00:53:31,768
Okay.

933
00:53:31,768 --> 00:53:32,288
- No problem.
- Thank you so much.

934
00:53:32,288 --> 00:53:33,479
- No problem.
- Thank you so much.

935
00:53:33,479 --> 00:53:35,020
I have no reception on my phone.

936
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,059
- Okay.
- Thanks.

937
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:47,136
- Mr. Xu.
- Tang Ying.

938
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,480
Xu Ziquan, why did you suddenly run away?

939
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,140
Shouldn't you think about where we're going to celebrate tonight?

940
00:54:13,348 --> 00:54:14,972
Celebrate?

941
00:54:15,748 --> 00:54:17,304
Yeah.

942
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:21,660
Did you know that WFC has a secret passage?

943
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,599
I've never told anyone about it.

944
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,760
You can go up to the roof from there

945
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,920
and overlook the entire CBD,

946
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,840
but no one knows what I'm looking at.

947
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,220
I'll take you there when you finish the case.

948
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,779
How did you know I was here?

949
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,280
The flowers you gave me are beautiful.

950
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,820
Not as good as the ones they gave you.

951
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,080
Big and exquisite.

952
00:55:28,228 --> 00:55:29,939
So what?

953
00:55:29,939 --> 00:55:33,479
I only like the bunch you gave me.

954
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:54,656
Beijing is really big.

955
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,620
But we...

956
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:05,800
are really small.

957
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,644
So small...

958
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:20,360
that it seems like, no matter how hard you try,

959
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:24,399
that it seems like, no matter how hard you try,

960
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,359
you can't be seen by anyone.

961
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:48,639
It's actually not a big deal.

962
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,240
It's just a failure.

963
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,512
- Rest well. Good night.
- Rest well, good night.

964
00:57:20,512 --> 00:57:21,560
- Rest well. Good night.
- Rest well, good night.

965
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,200
- Rest well. Good night.
- Rest well, good night.

966
00:57:24,104 --> 00:57:25,524
