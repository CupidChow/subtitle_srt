- Come on, sit.

10
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:54,940
Dr. Tian, the prescription you gave me last time really worked.

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,600
It was quite effective.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,139

No.

17
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:20,600
Since you don't want one, then why are you so eager to see a doctor?

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,676
Look at those male patients outside.

It's male pride.

21
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,060
Dr. Tian, please understand.

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,400
How about this? You give your husband a call.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,359
At least, I need to understand what exactly your husband's situation is.

He's usually very busy with work, and when I call him,

26
00:01:54,084 --> 00:02:01,400
he can't answer during work, so, he might not be able to answer.

- Let me try.

What-What should I do?

150
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:12,092

151
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:15,456
What if he really likes me...

152
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,042
and I don't handle it well?

153
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:20,740
Wouldn't it harm our case?

154
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,496
But what if you handle it well?

155
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:27,743
As a worker in the workplace, you should learn to leverage all the resources around you.

156
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:32,703
If you're smart enough, there might be a cleverer solution to this.

157
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:35,988
Having choices is a luxury.

158
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:37,463
So you're very lucky.

159
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,643
The opportunity is right in front of you.

160
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:43,664
If you handle this well, it will mean a promotion and raise.

161
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:46,923
Of course, there are also certain risks.

162
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:50,463

00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,392
What would you like to eat?

177
00:15:04,943 --> 00:15:06,468
I can eat anything.

178
00:15:06,468 --> 00:15:09,063
There's a very authentic mutton soup place near my house.

179
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:10,844
Would you like to try it?

180
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:22,743
Be careful.

181
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:25,284
This box is so big.

182
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:28,283
- The benefits are really good.
- So good.

183
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:30,628
The company treats us really well.

184
00:15:41,363 --> 00:15:42,788
No need to give it to Xu Ziquan.

185
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:45,344
He'll be gone in a few days.

186
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:59,540
- Boss-Boss, do you need help?
- No.

187
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,020
- Boss-Boss, do you need help?
- No.

188
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,004
Where are Jin Hao and Dou?

189
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:07,520
They have been visiting Miss Ada frequently recently.

190
00:16:10,323 --> 00:16:12,942
By the way, keep an eye on a recent project for me.

191
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:15,923
- I'll send the specifics to your phone.
- Okay.

192
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:19,320
Before I get back, don't tell anyone which company I've been in touch with.

193
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,748
Don't worry, Boss.

194
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,612
Boss…

195
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:25,440
Eat your mangoes.

196
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:40,288
Hello, Mrs. Meiling.

197
00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:43,940
You're in Beijing.

198
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:47,443
Sure, no problem.

199
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:49,744
I'll come to you.

200
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:52,032
Okay, see you later.

Tang Ying.

203
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:09,696
Mrs. Meiling.

204
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:12,020
You changed your hairstyle.

205
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,476
Do you like it?

206
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:15,124
It looks nice. A different style.

207
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:17,444
It looks nice. A different style.

208
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:19,688
Here, have some water.

209
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:24,059
How's it going? Are you getting along well with the legal specialist at our company?

210
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,870
Pretty good.

211
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:33,539
Actually, I wanted to invite you to dinner just to say thank you.

212
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:36,444
Thank me?

213
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,619
I got a divorce.

214
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:48,270
After seeing countless jelly beans on his phone,

215
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,610
Mrs. Meiling started to doubt

216
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:56,238
whether everything she had built till now had any meaning at all.

217
00:17:56,238 --> 00:18:01,019
Her marriage, her life, these facades,

218
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:05,199
were they deceiving others, or just fooling herself?

219
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:09,156
But looking at everything she already possessed, she hesitated.

220
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:13,639
Until that day, when her flight landed ahead of schedule.

221
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,678
Hurry, she's back.

222
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:47,904
Get dressed now.

223
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:50,532
Forget it, just go.

224
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,852
You…

225
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:19,572
Why didn't you tell me you would be back so I could pick you up?

226
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:24,164
I always thought you were ill.

227
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:27,539
Turns out you were spending your time with someone else.

228
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:31,996
Jelly Bean, I was drunk, you know?

229
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,976
I don't even know how I got back.

230
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:36,828
Jelly Bean.

231
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:45,818
When you touched my hand, it made me feel utterly nauseated.

232
00:19:46,258 --> 00:19:48,996
And stop calling me "Jelly Bean".

233
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,912
It's also disgusting.

234
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:58,398
I'll send you the divorce papers. Sign them quickly.

235
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:59,998
- Stop it, will you?
- Let go.

236
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,056
- Let go.
- Will you stop?

237
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:02,840
Let go.

238
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,488
You're really terrible at sex.

239
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:38,779
I thought I'd keep living like this, deceiving myself.

240
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,712
I thought I'd keep living like this, deceiving myself.

241
00:20:40,712 --> 00:20:41,939
It seemed all right. But then I realized I couldn't.

242
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:44,612
It seemed all right. But then I realized I couldn't.

243
00:20:45,984 --> 00:20:47,279
Mainly because Zhang Yiwen appeared.

244
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,020
Mainly because Zhang Yiwen appeared.

245
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,098
Yes, I feel like he reminded me

246
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:58,304
of who I used to be.

What brings you here?

249
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,288
A business trip.

250
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:33,099
Well, I was passing by.

251
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:34,439
I happened to be in the area, so I came.

252
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:36,616
I happened to be in the area, so I came.

253
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,498
This area of yours is large.

254
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:46,138
You've come to Shanghai.

255
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,738
Yes.

256
00:21:47,738 --> 00:21:50,076
I've come to Shanghai.

257
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,864
I got a divorce.

258
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:05,888
I know.

259
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,760
I'm doing pretty well. You-You're doing well too, right?

260
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,480
I'm doing pretty well. You-You're doing well too, right?

261
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:22,372
When are you leaving?

262
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:31,148
I haven't bought my ticket yet.

263
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,844
Are you free later?

264
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,372
Let's go and have a meal.

265
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:58,779

266
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:03,416
I might have missed him for the rest of my life.

00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:07,264
So, thank you.

00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:10,358
Congratulations.

Thank you.

270
00:23:57,376 --> 00:24:00,452
Miss Tang, your meeting minutes were very detailed.

271
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:03,012
I look forward to cooperating with you.

272
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,820
Perfect.

273
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:15,178
For the Matsuba crab, we should mainly eat its meat.

274
00:24:15,178 --> 00:24:16,779
For the Matsuba crab, we should mainly eat its meat.

275
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:19,239
The hairy crab is more popular with us normally,

276
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,479
and it's about the roe.

277
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:21,579
When Autumn comes, I'll take you all to Shanghai

278
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:23,099
When Autumn comes, I'll take you all to Shanghai

279
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,399
to taste the authentic Yangcheng Lake hairy crab.

280
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:26,979
All right, that sounds like a plan.

281
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:28,879
So, for our team building, we're going to Shanghai,

282
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:30,379
and you'll treat us to freshly on-season crabs.

283
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:32,619
For hairy crabs, we have to wait until they're in season,

284
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:34,944
and then wait another two to three weeks,

285
00:24:34,944 --> 00:24:36,516
that's when they're the fattiest.

286
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,619
We have a saying, "Nine females and ten males." Have you heard of it?

287
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:40,019
We have a saying, "Nine females and ten males." Have you heard of it?

288
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:40,779
No, we haven't.

289
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,798
The nine and ten here refer to the months in our lunar calendar.

290
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,336
The nine and ten here refer to the months in our lunar calendar.

291
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:48,640
But, Mr. Hu, don't just keep talking.

292
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,199
But, Mr. Hu, don't just keep talking.

293
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,358
Look. You haven't eaten the crab meat on your plate, and it's about to overflow.

294
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,758
Look. You haven't eaten the crab meat on your plate, and it's about to overflow.

295
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,099
It's true.

296
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:56,838
I have this problem that I love to peel but not eat.

297
00:24:56,838 --> 00:24:59,652
I have this problem that I love to peel but not eat.

298
00:24:59,652 --> 00:25:01,819
Here! Let's share it and eat together.

299
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:04,548
Here, Xinzi, let me give you some.

300
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:06,239
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

301
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:07,178
- Isn't it a bit too much?
- No, it's not too much at all.

302
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:08,519
- Isn't it a bit too much?
- No, it's not too much at all.

303
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,659
Help me divide it. Eat more.

304
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,218
Help me divide it. Eat more.

305
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,379
You know, your habit of loving to peel crabs

306
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,859
but not eating them is just fantastic.

307
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:16,478
but not eating them is just fantastic.

308
00:25:16,478 --> 00:25:18,579
In the future, if anyone becomes your girlfriend,

309
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:20,339
she will be so lucky.

310
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:21,439
Who can argue with that?

311
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:23,158
Xinzi's boyfriend is just like that,

312
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:24,499
treating her with complete compliance. Not to mention peeling crabs,

313
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:25,678
treating her with complete compliance. Not to mention peeling crabs,

314
00:25:25,678 --> 00:25:28,898
he could even skin a spider for her.

315
00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:31,268
Xinzi has a boyfriend? It makes sense.

316
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:32,339
Xinzi has a boyfriend? It makes sense.

317
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:34,599
You see, if such a beautiful girl like you were truly single, I would find it a bit strange.

318
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,099
You see, if such a beautiful girl like you were truly single, I would find it a bit strange.

319
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:37,379
Hurry up and dig in.

320
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:39,720
I'll continue peeling for you, come on.

321
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,658
Xinzi, I want to buy a gift for a girl I like,

322
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:44,358
and I'd like to ask for your advice.

323
00:25:44,358 --> 00:25:45,259
I don't have good taste. Should we ask others to help you choose?

324
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:48,698
I don't have good taste. Should we ask others to help you choose?

325
00:25:48,698 --> 00:25:50,759
Your taste is indeed not good.

326
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,759
So you should ask others for help.

327
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:01,539
Xinzi, you didn't misunderstand

328
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:04,039
and think the girl I like is you, did you?

329
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,398
How could I possibly think it was me?

330
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:11,239
After all, I have a boyfriend. Right?

331
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:13,198
Yes.

332
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:14,898
You know I am still your leader right now, but it's so hard to ask you for a favor.

333
00:26:14,898 --> 00:26:17,376
You know I am still your leader right now, but it's so hard to ask you for a favor.

334
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:19,879
And do you think I am the kind of person

335
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:22,718
who'd eagerly steal someone from others?

336
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:25,098
It makes sense.

337
00:26:25,098 --> 00:26:28,759
How about this? Tell me your budget, taboos,

338
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,099
and any special meanings, and I'll help you choose.

339
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:31,859
and any special meanings, and I'll help you choose.

340
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,119
and any special meanings, and I'll help you choose.

341
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,319
Okay, there are no special meanings,

342
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,839
no taboos, and no expected price range.

343
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,979
no taboos, and no expected price range.

344
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:39,859
Let's just choose the expensive one.

345
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:41,504
- That's so perfunctory.
- No, it's not.

346
00:26:41,504 --> 00:26:44,279
It's because I trust your taste.

347
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,898
You just said my taste was not good.

348
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:48,840
I meant your taste in picking men.

349
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,218
Xinzi, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.

350
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:53,219
Xinzi, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.

351
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:55,488
I know you're my leader, but I still have to say this.

352
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,518
I know you're my leader, but I still have to say this.

353
00:26:57,518 --> 00:26:59,640
I don't want to hear anyone talk badly about my boyfriend in front of me,

354
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,959
I don't want to hear anyone talk badly about my boyfriend in front of me,

355
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,259
especially when you don't know much about him.

356
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:05,572
especially when you don't know much about him.

357
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:14,424
Mr. Xu, Richard specifically told me to accompany you and give you a hand.

358
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,488
Mr. Xu, Richard specifically told me to accompany you and give you a hand.

359
00:27:15,488 --> 00:27:17,138
Mr. Xu, Richard specifically told me to accompany you and give you a hand.

360
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:19,076
As for the hotel, it's not that I'm not attentive,

361
00:27:19,076 --> 00:27:20,798
there just aren't any good hotels.

362
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:23,460
When you get there, please don't be angry.

363
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,499
No problem, as long as there's a bed to sleep in.

364
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:27,119
No problem, as long as there's a bed to sleep in.

365
00:27:32,104 --> 00:27:33,728
Over here, Mr. Xu.

366
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:53,604
Where is dinner arranged?

367
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:55,524
They said it's the best restaurant in the local area,

368
00:27:55,524 --> 00:27:57,138
and they just sent me the location.

369
00:27:57,138 --> 00:27:58,552
Let's go.

370
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,256
Wait for me, sorry.

371
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:35,978
Mr. Ma.

372
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:38,919
I just went for a bike ride.

373
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:44,239
You changed your car.

374
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:00,139
- They haven't arrived yet.
- I'll go to the restroom.

375
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:02,112
- They haven't arrived yet.
- I'll go to the restroom.

376
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:05,952
To be honest, when you sent me this address yesterday,

377
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,539
To be honest, when you sent me this address yesterday,

378
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,500
I was a bit surprised.

379
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,580
I thought we would go for mutton soup.

380
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,638
I really do like mutton soup,

381
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:21,179
but it's nice to change up the flavors now and then.

382
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:24,059
This place seems like the food should be good.

383
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,239
- Here.
- Thank you.

384
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:28,759
Besides mutton soup, what else do you like?

385
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:31,959
Actually, I like drinking tea.

386
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:35,556
Not many young people like tea these days, huh?

387
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:37,218
Because I think when I'm drinking tea, it allows me to slow down.

388
00:29:37,218 --> 00:29:39,144
Because I think when I'm drinking tea, it allows me to slow down.

389
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,800
And actually, tea tasting is quite interesting.

390
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,879
For example, look at this menu here.

391
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:47,498
The Phoenix Dan Cong and Rock tea,

392
00:29:47,498 --> 00:29:49,519
even though they're both part of the oolong tea family,

393
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,478
and they're both semi-fermented teas, there's a big difference.

394
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:53,058
and they're both semi-fermented teas, there's a big difference.

395
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:55,579
Rock tea is a northern Fujian oolong,

396
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:58,624
and Phoenix Dan Cong is a Guangdong oolong.

397
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,099
Which one do you like?

398
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:04,559
Actually, they both have their own merits,

399
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,218
and their aromas are also different.

400
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:09,679
Rock tea is mainly characterized by its high boiling point,

401
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,219
its fruity and woody aroma, and it has a rather long-lasting fragrance.

402
00:30:11,219 --> 00:30:13,059
its fruity and woody aroma, and it has a rather long-lasting fragrance.

403
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:14,779
It tastes solid when you drink it.

404
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,418
Phoenix Dan Cong is mainly characterized by its low boiling point and floral aroma.

405
00:30:16,418 --> 00:30:18,059
Phoenix Dan Cong is mainly characterized by its low boiling point and floral aroma.

406
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,078
The fragrance doesn't last long, so it tastes a bit frivolous when you drink it.

407
00:30:20,078 --> 00:30:21,678
The fragrance doesn't last long, so it tastes a bit frivolous when you drink it.

408
00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:23,339
But it's lively.

409
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:27,748
So, it mainly depends on what you want to drink.

410
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,379
After dinner, let's have a solid cup.

411
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:35,932
Sounds good.

412
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:46,898
Young man, your face is all red.

413
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:51,560
This kid is stubborn, isn't he?

414
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,512
- Can you still drink?
- You're bluffing.

415
00:30:52,512 --> 00:30:53,558
- Can you still drink?
- You're bluffing.

416
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:55,859
Mr. Xu. Factory Manager, this is Mr. Xu.

417
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:56,938
Cheers.

418
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,239
Mr. Xu, a talented individual indeed.

419
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:00,712
Come on, take a seat.

420
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:03,012
Squeeze in, squeeze in.

421
00:31:03,012 --> 00:31:05,120
Okay, quiet down, guys.

422
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,176
Mr. Xu, please sit.

423
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:09,792
This is our guest of honor today. Mr. Xu.

424
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:10,819
This is our guest of honor today. Mr. Xu.

425
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:12,079
Everyone, a round of applause.

426
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,380
Good, good.

427
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,232
A little introduction. These are our friends today.

428
00:31:15,232 --> 00:31:17,179
A little introduction. These are our friends today.

429
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:18,638
You could say, in this place,

430
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:21,958
they are somewhat important figures. Right?

431
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:23,798
The cultural group.

432
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,152
All the performances will be well arranged by us.

433
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:28,552
All the performances will be well arranged by us.

434
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:29,568
For loan-related issues, you can come to me, no problem.

435
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:31,984
For loan-related issues, you can come to me, no problem.

436
00:31:31,984 --> 00:31:34,099
The young man is really good-looking.

437
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:36,319
- Later, Old Bai will set you up with someone.
- Hello, hello.

438
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,879
If you need steel, talk to me.

439
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:39,938
I'll give you the good ones.

440
00:31:39,938 --> 00:31:41,658
Cheers.

441
00:31:41,658 --> 00:31:45,736
- Let's introduce this person, it's our…
- Do we even need to say?

442
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:47,299
You've heard of the Tomson Revival. Right?

443
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:49,216
It was built by him.

444
00:31:49,216 --> 00:31:51,698
He's an entrepreneur; the big boss.

445
00:31:51,698 --> 00:31:53,418
Brother Shan, isn't it?

446
00:31:53,418 --> 00:31:54,779
Yes, right.

447
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,859
Brother Shan, his reputation is high.

448
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:58,059
Well, everyone, please have a seat.

449
00:31:58,059 --> 00:31:59,059
Let's sit.

450
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:00,139
Why be so polite?

451
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:01,739
Sit, sit.

452
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:02,619
- Look, your face is all red.
- You've introduced us,

453
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:05,692
- Look, your face is all red.
- You've introduced us,

454
00:32:05,692 --> 00:32:08,459
but you didn't say what Mr. Xu does for a living.

455
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,819
Haven't I told you before?

456
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:13,779
Well, he is with that Xin…

457
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:15,458
Jintou Xintai.

458
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,798
Never mind what it is.

459
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,088
It's about taking companies public,

460
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:20,384
resource integration and transformation, and revitalizing our Anbei market.

461
00:32:20,384 --> 00:32:23,098
resource integration and transformation, and revitalizing our Anbei market.

462
00:32:23,098 --> 00:32:24,859
By him?

463
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,179
Can this young man do it?

464
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:28,859
Though the weight is small, it can weigh a thousand pounds. Right?

465
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:30,078
I like that.

466
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:31,999
Let's not talk about it, let's…

467
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:33,418
How about a toast to Mr. Xu?

468
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,539
- Good idea. Come on, let's toast.
- Wait a minute.

469
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:35,559
- Good idea. Come on, let's toast.
- Wait a minute.

470
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,279
According to our rules in Anbei, we must drink Chinese wine. Right?

471
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,379
According to our rules in Anbei, we must drink Chinese wine. Right?

472
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:40,819
- I'll pour for you.
- Thank you.

473
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:43,779
Of course, it must be Chinese wine.

474
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:45,178
Come on, fill it up.

475
00:32:45,178 --> 00:32:47,159
A full glass is a sincere heart.

476
00:32:55,332 --> 00:32:58,108
Unfortunately, the weather is not so good today.

477
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,160
During Autumn in Beijing, the bike view along Chang'an Street is particularly beautiful.

478
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,720
During Autumn in Beijing, the bike view along Chang'an Street is particularly beautiful.

479
00:33:05,898 --> 00:33:07,479
You also like riding bikes.

480
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:09,662
I also like riding bikes.

481
00:33:09,662 --> 00:33:12,361
Have you read "Spring Evening" by Yu Dafu?

482
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:14,242
Spring Evening?

483
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,101
On A Night Drunk with the Spring Breeze.

484
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:20,922
Every time I ride a bike along Chang'an Street, I would think of this piece.

485
00:33:20,922 --> 00:33:22,600
Every time I ride a bike along Chang'an Street, I would think of this piece.

486
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,222
Because the scenery is really too beautiful.

487
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:30,301
The last time I rode a bike along Chang'an Street was when I was in college.

488
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:33,041
The last time I rode a bike along Chang'an Street was when I was in college.

489
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:38,781
Unfortunately, my cycling skills are not good.

490
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:40,882
Otherwise, I wouldn't have bumped into you last time.

491
00:33:40,882 --> 00:33:42,821
I'm really sorry.

492
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,376
You didn't have any after-effects, did you?

493
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:48,201
No, no.

494
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,876
I'm very tough. I can't be hurt.

495
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:20,200
See you next time.

496
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,116
See you next time.

497
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:29,284
Phoenix Dan Cong, solid.

498
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:32,160
Rock tea.

499
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:36,702
Frivolous?

500
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:38,023
You got it backward.

501
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:40,403
Just drinking tea, can you really tell the difference?

502
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:42,556
Are you messing with me?

503
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,243
How could it be?

504
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:45,323
Before I went there, I studied here all night at the teahouse.

505
00:34:45,323 --> 00:34:48,362
Before I went there, I studied here all night at the teahouse.

506
00:34:48,362 --> 00:34:50,443
I asked them a lot of questions.

507
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:52,682
You worked so hard.

508
00:34:52,682 --> 00:34:54,583
You put in the effort you would for a background check.

509
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,083
If you don't succeed, who will?

510
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:58,852
I'm even worried if I tried too hard.

511
00:34:58,852 --> 00:35:01,192
You had a meal with Mr. Ma.

512
00:35:01,192 --> 00:35:03,360
How do you feel about him?

513
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,120
He's not like the rich man I imagined.

514
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,800
Maybe because he is a first-generation entrepreneur. He's very down-to-earth.

515
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,048
Maybe because he is a first-generation entrepreneur. He's very down-to-earth.

516
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:12,792
Do you like him?

517
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:13,562
I can't say I like him. At most, I don't dislike him.

518
00:35:13,562 --> 00:35:16,264
I can't say I like him. At most, I don't dislike him.

519
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:17,323
So I suggest, for this matter, we should focus on landing this project.

520
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,762
So I suggest, for this matter, we should focus on landing this project.

521
00:35:18,762 --> 00:35:22,843
So I suggest, for this matter, we should focus on landing this project.

522
00:35:22,843 --> 00:35:24,762
First, try to figure out what he sees in you.

523
00:35:24,762 --> 00:35:26,442
First, try to figure out what he sees in you.

524
00:35:26,442 --> 00:35:28,443
And then you just take this strength and maximize it.

525
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:30,428
And then you just take this strength and maximize it.

526
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:33,703
I don't know what he sees in me.

527
00:35:33,703 --> 00:35:35,588
It certainly can't be my looks.

528
00:35:35,588 --> 00:35:36,923
So the first time you met, he was interested in you, a little lawyer.

529
00:35:36,923 --> 00:35:39,762
So the first time you met, he was interested in you, a little lawyer.

530
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,404
It certainly can't be for any practical value.

531
00:35:42,404 --> 00:35:45,936
Could it be that I provided emotional value for him?

532
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:50,782
Maybe he finds me interesting and fun

533
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,648
and wants to ask me out for a chat over dinner.

534
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:53,942
Anyway, I suggest that the next time you see him,

535
00:35:53,942 --> 00:35:56,723
Anyway, I suggest that the next time you see him,

536
00:35:56,723 --> 00:35:59,303
show more of your professional woman's aura.

537
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:01,443
Don't let him look down on you.

538
00:36:01,443 --> 00:36:03,096
You're right.

539
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:09,742
After leaving it has gotten quite lonely here, hasn't it?

540
00:36:09,742 --> 00:36:11,784
After leaving it has gotten quite lonely here, hasn't it?

541
00:36:11,784 --> 00:36:12,640
You call this lonely? This is called tranquility.

542
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,122
You call this lonely? This is called tranquility.

543
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:17,682
How are things with you and Xu Jiabai?

544
00:36:17,682 --> 00:36:18,883
To be honest, he takes care of me in every possible way.

545
00:36:18,883 --> 00:36:21,508
To be honest, he takes care of me in every possible way.

546
00:36:21,508 --> 00:36:22,963
Every morning when I wake up, I can see a full breakfast he prepared for me.

547
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:26,323
Every morning when I wake up, I can see a full breakfast he prepared for me.

548
00:36:26,323 --> 00:36:27,803
It's nothing like when I lived with you.

549
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:29,642
Every day all I ate was some junk food.

550
00:36:29,642 --> 00:36:31,503
What kind of junk food?

551
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:33,483
So, you are showing off your love

552
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,524
and rubbing it in my face, huh?

553
00:36:35,524 --> 00:36:39,802
Honestly, I feel he's a bit overly attentive to me.

554
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:41,143
It makes me a bit uncomfortable.

555
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:42,382
Men in love are like this, anxious and insecure.

556
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:44,843
Men in love are like this, anxious and insecure.

557
00:36:44,843 --> 00:36:46,483
But you have no idea.

558
00:36:46,483 --> 00:36:47,923
Every day when I go out, he is always fussing over my clothes.

559
00:36:47,923 --> 00:36:49,302
Every day when I go out, he is always fussing over my clothes.

560
00:36:49,302 --> 00:36:50,263
Walking on the street, he thinks there are men staring at me.

561
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:52,143
Walking on the street, he thinks there are men staring at me.

562
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,862
He's totally fallen for me.

563
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:56,542
He's just nervous about you.

564
00:36:57,402 --> 00:36:59,122
This bath oil of yours is very expensive.

565
00:36:59,122 --> 00:37:02,083
If you take it and lose it, what will you do then?

566
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,543
Just keep it at home for your own use.

567
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:04,963
I bought it to use it.

568
00:37:04,963 --> 00:37:06,963
We should learn to enjoy things.

569
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:07,803
It hasn't been opened yet. I opened it specifically for you.

570
00:37:07,803 --> 00:37:09,082
It hasn't been opened yet. I opened it specifically for you.

571
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:10,803
See how good I am to you.

572
00:37:10,803 --> 00:37:12,562
Wait! We're going to the bathhouse

573
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:14,762
just to eat the buffet, to scrub off the dirt, and to gossip while lying down?

574
00:37:14,762 --> 00:37:16,443
just to eat the buffet, to scrub off the dirt, and to gossip while lying down?

575
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,583
Why are you trying to be so fancy?

576
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,002
What dirt to scrub off? I am very clean.

577
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:21,342
What dirt to scrub off? I am very clean.

578
00:37:21,342 --> 00:37:22,760
I don't need to scrub off anything.

579
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,648
Have you forgotten how you got scrubbed by Aunt as a child

580
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:26,102
Have you forgotten how you got scrubbed by Aunt as a child

581
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:28,363
when you were covered in dirt, the floor was all muddy, and even the drain was blocked?

582
00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:29,962
when you were covered in dirt, the floor was all muddy, and even the drain was blocked?

583
00:37:29,962 --> 00:37:31,242
- Don't slander me.
- You need to scrub off the dirt.

584
00:37:31,242 --> 00:37:32,402
- Don't slander me.
- You need to scrub off the dirt.

585
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:35,624
You still need to scrub it off, huh?

586
00:37:35,624 --> 00:37:37,248
Thank you.

587
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:48,263
- Hello.
- How may I help you?

588
00:37:48,263 --> 00:37:50,302
Could you arrange two scrubs for us?

589
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,704
- Okay.
- Thank you.

590
00:37:53,403 --> 00:37:56,202
- Brother Shan.
- Why did it take you so long to undress?

591
00:37:56,202 --> 00:37:57,722
You came, Brother Shan.

592
00:37:57,722 --> 00:37:58,820
Okay.

593
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,064
Brother Shan.

594
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:01,483
Brother Shan! Brother Shan!

595
00:38:01,483 --> 00:38:04,443
We've been waiting for you. We don't need to spend any money.

596
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:07,562
- Brother Shan.
- Brother Shan.

597
00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:10,083
This is the feeling.

598
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:11,702
- Just enjoy it.
- Good.

599
00:38:11,702 --> 00:38:14,548
- How about it, Brother Shan?
- Brother Shan, remember to go upstairs later.

600
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:16,264
Is it comfortable?

601
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:38,503
Do you still remember

602
00:38:38,503 --> 00:38:40,003
that time you competed with me in the sauna to see who would faint first?

603
00:38:40,003 --> 00:38:43,983
that time you competed with me in the sauna to see who would faint first?

604
00:38:43,983 --> 00:38:45,860
Don't talk. You're affecting my performance.

605
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,023
Don't talk. You're affecting my performance.

606
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:50,762
How did my aunt describe you?

607
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:54,023
Stubborn and competitive, not taking the easy way.

608
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:56,723
Every time my mom calls your mom, these are the two words she uses.

609
00:38:56,723 --> 00:38:57,743
Every time my mom calls your mom, these are the two words she uses.

610
00:38:57,743 --> 00:39:01,722
Do you know what kind of a pipe dream your aunt is having now?

611
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:05,920
She wants to come to Beijing to buy me a house.

612
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,200
Did my aunt become rich overnight?

613
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,003
She's not thinking clearly.

614
00:39:10,003 --> 00:39:12,768
She doesn't understand the housing prices in Beijing at all.

615
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:15,222
How could we, as workers, possibly afford it?

616
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:16,822
I agree.

617
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:20,363
They can't imagine the situation in Beijing at all from our hometown.

618
00:39:20,363 --> 00:39:22,336
Look at our monthly salary. It's so little.

619
00:39:22,336 --> 00:39:23,876
Look at our monthly salary. It's so little.

620
00:39:23,876 --> 00:39:25,022
If we talk about down payments,

621
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:27,802
we could only buy those old, worn-out second-hand houses,

622
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:30,364
tiny and crowded, with no elevator,

623
00:39:30,364 --> 00:39:33,003
and definitely not in the school district.

624
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:41,440
How's it going between you and Xu Ziquan?

625
00:39:44,862 --> 00:39:47,023
Pure friendship.

626
00:39:47,023 --> 00:39:49,764
Who would believe that?

627
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:53,468
You're not deceived by his rubbish talk, are you?

628
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:56,960
Let's go and get something to eat.

629
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,016
There's also buffet food.

630
00:39:58,016 --> 00:39:59,323
Have you stayed enough?

631
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:00,363
It's okay. Let me tell you.

632
00:40:00,363 --> 00:40:02,183
Go take a sauna.

633
00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:04,483
What's up with you?

634
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:07,620
Didn't you use to take baths at home?

635
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,796
Mr. Xu is shy.

636
00:40:09,796 --> 00:40:11,284
Rarely.

637
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:19,803
I actually have something to tell you.

638
00:40:19,803 --> 00:40:21,468
What is it?

639
00:40:23,323 --> 00:40:26,662
Do you remember that guy from Palm Bay?

640
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:28,548
The one who invited you for mutton soup?

641
00:40:28,548 --> 00:40:30,028
I know, yeah.

642
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,503
He later became your client, didn't he?

643
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:34,600
He asked me out.

644
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,068
On a date?

645
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:37,480
Do you mind?

646
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,400
Do you like him?

647
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,100
I don't like him.

648
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,602
But on the one hand, he is my client.

649
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:44,662
I have a professional relationship with him, so I can't refuse him.

650
00:40:44,662 --> 00:40:46,402
On the other hand, I think

651
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,583
there's nothing wrong with getting to know him.

652
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:51,108
I see it as a kind of exercise.

653
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:54,562
If you want to deal with him, go ahead.

654
00:40:54,562 --> 00:40:56,662
I just feel that he might be a little bit rustic.

655
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,282
No, to be precise, he is a bit too down-to-earth.

656
00:40:58,282 --> 00:41:02,024
No, to be precise, he is a bit too down-to-earth.

657
00:41:03,403 --> 00:41:04,602
So he is really rich?

658
00:41:04,602 --> 00:41:06,482
Super rich.

659
00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:09,803
Super rich?

660
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:14,143
I was wondering why you suddenly asked me to take a bath.

661
00:41:14,143 --> 00:41:16,776
Then let's have a toast.

662
00:41:43,744 --> 00:41:44,996
No worries.

663
00:41:44,996 --> 00:41:48,242
Who doesn't slack off a bit at work?

664
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:50,762
- Here's the information on the Wanguo M&A case.
- Look carefully.

665
00:41:50,762 --> 00:41:51,964
Okay.

666
00:41:51,964 --> 00:41:54,702
The world is quite cruel, isn't it?

667
00:41:54,702 --> 00:41:56,836
You have to work and deal with interpersonal relationships.

668
00:41:56,836 --> 00:41:59,103
No one cares whether you have enough time.

669
00:41:59,103 --> 00:42:02,023
They only care if you're doing well enough.

670
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:03,392
Not giving up on either side is what a worker does.

671
00:42:03,392 --> 00:42:05,408
Not giving up on either side is what a worker does.

672
00:42:05,408 --> 00:42:06,642
I read the report you sent me yesterday. It's very professional.

673
00:42:06,642 --> 00:42:07,680
I read the report you sent me yesterday. It's very professional.

674
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,142
I was impressed.

675
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:13,504
Thank you.

676
00:42:13,504 --> 00:42:15,012
Why are you blushing?

677
00:42:15,012 --> 00:42:17,463
Hasn't anyone praised you before?

678
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:19,520
When Wang was here,

679
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,012
all she said was "no, not right, not possible."

680
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:24,708
Everything started with a 'no'.

681
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,082
- I know it's her personality, but…
- I see, a lack of affirmation.

682
00:42:26,082 --> 00:42:28,328
- I know it's her personality, but…
- I see, a lack of affirmation.

683
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:29,448
No worries.

684
00:42:29,448 --> 00:42:31,972
I'm here now, and I'll praise you in the future.

685
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,242
By the way, the afternoon meeting, Mr. Ma changed it to 7:00 p.m.

686
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:37,642
By the way, the afternoon meeting, Mr. Ma changed it to 7:00 p.m.

687
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:39,140
and it's at the golf course.

688
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,024
I see you've got a good grip on this case. So I won't go.

689
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:42,308
I see you've got a good grip on this case. So I won't go.

690
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:43,872
You can report to him.

691
00:42:43,872 --> 00:42:45,344
Am I going alone?

692
00:42:45,344 --> 00:42:46,363
Why are you getting nervous? Didn't I just say how great you are?

693
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,923
Why are you getting nervous? Didn't I just say how great you are?

694
00:42:49,704 --> 00:42:51,562
Okay.

695
00:42:51,562 --> 00:42:54,203
Be tough in tactics and soft in demeanor.

696
00:42:54,203 --> 00:42:55,652
You are the best.

697
00:42:55,652 --> 00:42:57,276
Keep it up.

698
00:43:23,432 --> 00:43:25,124
Mr. Ma.

699
00:43:25,124 --> 00:43:28,480
- Mr. Ma.
- You're here.

700
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,602
It's okay. Take your time. I'll just wait here for you.

701
00:43:29,602 --> 00:43:31,643
It's okay. Take your time. I'll just wait here for you.

702
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,572
That's impressive.

703
00:43:38,956 --> 00:43:40,123
Come on, you have a go.

704
00:43:40,123 --> 00:43:41,603
No, I can't.

705
00:43:41,603 --> 00:43:42,562
And I've never understood the pleasure of playing golf.

706
00:43:42,562 --> 00:43:46,342
And I've never understood the pleasure of playing golf.

707
00:43:46,342 --> 00:43:50,112
Because this sport seems too static.

708
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:52,283
In golf, you can imagine that each hole is

709
00:43:52,283 --> 00:43:53,563
In golf, you can imagine that each hole is

710
00:43:53,563 --> 00:43:55,528
In golf, you can imagine that each hole is

711
00:43:55,528 --> 00:43:57,882
one of the many goals in our lives.

712
00:43:57,882 --> 00:43:59,523
Every time you swing,

713
00:43:59,523 --> 00:44:02,182
perhaps it's not about how to get the ball into the hole,

714
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:04,303
but to achieve each and every goal you set for yourself.

715
00:44:04,303 --> 00:44:07,202
but to achieve each and every goal you set for yourself.

716
00:44:08,003 --> 00:44:09,722
Is that true for every golfer?

717
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:11,302
Is that true for every golfer?

718
00:44:11,302 --> 00:44:12,303
Not necessarily. Because everyone interprets things differently.

719
00:44:12,303 --> 00:44:14,662
Not necessarily. Because everyone interprets things differently.

720
00:44:14,662 --> 00:44:16,943
Hearing you say that,

721
00:44:16,943 --> 00:44:19,262
I've become a bit interested.

722
00:44:19,262 --> 00:44:21,323
Well then, give it a try.

723
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:24,082
Your shoulder, waist, and hip, should be in a straight line.

724
00:44:24,082 --> 00:44:26,443
Your shoulder, waist, and hip, should be in a straight line.

725
00:44:53,188 --> 00:44:54,672
Come on.

726
00:45:01,363 --> 00:45:03,042
Not bad, you hit it. Another one.

727
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:04,143
Not bad, you hit it. Another one.

728
00:45:04,143 --> 00:45:06,262
Hitting it counts as good?

729
00:45:06,262 --> 00:45:09,762
You've got to start somewhere.

730
00:45:09,762 --> 00:45:12,383
Look. The difference

731
00:45:12,383 --> 00:45:14,803
between golf and other sports is

732
00:45:14,803 --> 00:45:17,222
your only enemy is always yourself.

733
00:45:17,222 --> 00:45:19,863
So, it's a sport where you can make a mistake at any time,

734
00:45:19,863 --> 00:45:22,043
just like in our daily life.

735
00:45:22,043 --> 00:45:25,363
If you want to let go and not be entangled,

736
00:45:25,363 --> 00:45:28,323
you have to immediately and quickly adjust your mindset, and start over.

737
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:30,303
you have to immediately and quickly adjust your mindset, and start over.

738
00:45:30,943 --> 00:45:33,023
Come on! Find the feeling and try again.

739
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:33,952
- Starting over.
- Start over.

740
00:45:33,952 --> 00:45:35,640
- Starting over.
- Start over.

741
00:45:40,843 --> 00:45:43,344
Not bad, the line is straight. The line is straight.

742
00:45:43,344 --> 00:45:44,763
Not bad, the line is straight. The line is straight.

743
00:45:44,763 --> 00:45:47,528
No, I'm not good at this,

744
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:49,903
and I don't have any talent for it.

745
00:45:49,903 --> 00:45:52,922
Mr. Ma, I'd better report to you about my work.

746
00:45:52,922 --> 00:45:55,940
You haven't even tried and you're already negating yourself.

747
00:45:57,762 --> 00:45:59,882
I've read your report. It's crystal clear at a glance.

748
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,122
I've read your report. It's crystal clear at a glance.

749
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:03,103
Actually, I don't have any questions.

750
00:46:03,103 --> 00:46:05,762
But you asked us to have a meeting.

751
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,648
Originally, it was because...

752
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:09,122
I saw you work hard, and I wanted to let you relax a bit.

753
00:46:09,122 --> 00:46:11,182
I saw you work hard, and I wanted to let you relax a bit.

754
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:12,352
However, I made you feel a bit tangled, huh?

755
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,323
However, I made you feel a bit tangled, huh?

756
00:46:14,323 --> 00:46:15,776
No, I'm very happy. Thank you, Mr. Ma.

757
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:16,896
No, I'm very happy. Thank you, Mr. Ma.

758
00:46:16,896 --> 00:46:19,236
My friend's daughter is going to have an art exhibition, and the opening is the day after tomorrow.

759
00:46:19,236 --> 00:46:19,863
My friend's daughter is going to have an art exhibition, and the opening is the day after tomorrow.

760
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:22,344
My friend's daughter is going to have an art exhibition, and the opening is the day after tomorrow.

761
00:46:22,344 --> 00:46:25,288
Are you interested in attending with me?

762
00:46:25,288 --> 00:46:26,852
Me?

763
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:28,540
Yes.

764
00:46:55,748 --> 00:46:57,436
What are you doing?

765
00:47:20,722 --> 00:47:22,484
Let's go.

766
00:47:25,223 --> 00:47:27,228
Meng, impressive.

767
00:47:27,228 --> 00:47:29,103
Come again.

768
00:47:29,103 --> 00:47:30,023
- Can I sit here?
- Come on, Mr. Li.

769
00:47:30,023 --> 00:47:32,172
Can I sit here?
- Come on, Mr. Li.

770
00:47:32,172 --> 00:47:33,883
Are you all right?

771
00:47:33,883 --> 00:47:36,312
Cute guy, did you come by yourself?

772
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:36,722
- What?
- Did you come by yourself?

773
00:47:36,722 --> 00:47:39,103
- What?
- Did you come by yourself?

774
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:41,160
With my assistant.

775
00:47:42,363 --> 00:47:44,103
Aren't you with Brother Shan?

776
00:47:44,103 --> 00:47:46,303
Yes, I came from out of town

777
00:47:46,303 --> 00:47:48,302
to talk business with Brother Shan.

778
00:47:48,302 --> 00:47:50,852
Then, will you have a drink with me?

779
00:47:57,682 --> 00:48:00,384
Let's add each other on WeChat.

780
00:48:02,483 --> 00:48:04,503
Let's ask Brother Shan to create a group. Okay?

781
00:48:04,503 --> 00:48:06,596
Let's ask Brother Shan to create a group. Okay?

782
00:48:06,596 --> 00:48:10,468
Brother Shan, your friend is too boring.

783
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,083
What's wrong, Quan? Not happy?

784
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,183
What's wrong, Quan? Not happy?

785
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,483
Sit down.

786
00:48:15,483 --> 00:48:17,003
Going out is about having fun.

787
00:48:17,003 --> 00:48:18,802
- I'm happy, happy.
- Right.

788
00:48:18,802 --> 00:48:20,096
I want to tell you we really don't do real estate.

789
00:48:20,096 --> 00:48:22,682
I want to tell you we really don't do real estate.

790
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:25,923
How about this? After I go back to Beijing,

791
00:48:25,923 --> 00:48:27,342
I'll organize some information and then send it to you.

792
00:48:27,342 --> 00:48:28,872
I'll organize some information and then send it to you.

793
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:30,322
You can see if there's anything you're interested in.

794
00:48:30,322 --> 00:48:32,003
If there is, we can talk further.

795
00:48:32,003 --> 00:48:33,163
- All right?
- Okay, no problem.

796
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:34,122
You've come a long way, so I should take good care of you. Right?

797
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:36,256
You've come a long way, so I should take good care of you. Right?

798
00:48:36,256 --> 00:48:39,463
Brother Shan, how about this?

799
00:48:39,463 --> 00:48:40,943
You guys have a good time.

800
00:48:40,943 --> 00:48:42,112
I'm a bit tired today, and I'll go back first.

801
00:48:42,112 --> 00:48:43,136
I'm a bit tired today, and I'll go back first.

802
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:45,123
What are you saying? You can't leave.

803
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:46,080
You're our guest of honor. What will we do if you leave?

804
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,323
You're our guest of honor. What will we do if you leave?

805
00:48:47,323 --> 00:48:49,320
I'm telling you! You can't leave, right?

806
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,862
Brother, can I take a call?

807
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:52,242
I won't leave. My clothes are here.

808
00:48:52,242 --> 00:48:54,023
Fine, you can take the call.

809
00:48:54,023 --> 00:48:55,624
Come back soon.

810
00:48:55,624 --> 00:48:57,082
Mu.

811
00:48:57,082 --> 00:49:00,484
Boss, the Universal Conjecture case is done.

812
00:49:02,323 --> 00:49:05,103
Okay, got it.

813
00:49:05,952 --> 00:49:07,736
Brother Shan.

814
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:11,523
I won't leave, okay?

815
00:49:11,523 --> 00:49:12,883
I'll stay in Anbei for a few more days.

816
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,536
Let's drink. Okay?

817
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,483
Come on, come here.

818
00:49:17,483 --> 00:49:19,303
Bottoms up. Okay?

819
00:49:19,303 --> 00:49:21,242
Come on!

820
00:49:55,336 --> 00:49:56,223
- Mr. Xu, look. This is our storage tank.
- Okay.

821
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,692
- Mr. Xu, look. This is our storage tank.
- Okay.

822
00:49:58,692 --> 00:50:00,096
Yes, we also have different grades.

823
00:50:00,096 --> 00:50:01,152
Take pictures.

824
00:50:01,152 --> 00:50:02,458
They are mass-produced.

825
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,892
This side is our fermentation tank.

826
00:50:09,392 --> 00:50:10,048
Right. They might look the same on the outside…

827
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,742
Right. They might look the same on the outside…

828
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,300
How is it?

829
00:50:13,843 --> 00:50:15,268
The taste is not bad.

830
00:50:15,268 --> 00:50:17,056
Try it.

831
00:50:20,012 --> 00:50:20,722
- A warm welcome.
- Bottoms up.

832
00:50:20,722 --> 00:50:23,032
- A warm welcome.
- Bottoms up.

833
00:50:24,736 --> 00:50:26,216
Come on.

834
00:50:41,824 --> 00:50:42,983
Excuse me, sir. Our plane is about to take off.

835
00:50:42,983 --> 00:50:44,242
Excuse me, sir. Our plane is about to take off.

836
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:46,643
Please confirm that your phone is in airplane mode and then turn it off. Thank you

837
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,200
Okay, thank you.

838
00:51:24,222 --> 00:51:25,736
Hair.

839
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:38,323
Miss Wang.

840
00:51:38,323 --> 00:51:39,483
Come on, let me see. Are you ready?

841
00:51:39,483 --> 00:51:41,368
Come on, let me see. Are you ready?

842
00:51:41,368 --> 00:51:43,143
Not really.

843
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:44,672
When does Ma Qiyuan want to meet you? Tomorrow?

844
00:51:44,672 --> 00:51:45,992
When does Ma Qiyuan want to meet you? Tomorrow?

845
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:46,823
Tomorrow. His friend's daughter is having an art exhibition in their courtyard house.

846
00:51:46,823 --> 00:51:48,403
Tomorrow. His friend's daughter is having an art exhibition in their courtyard house.

847
00:51:48,403 --> 00:51:50,874
Tomorrow. His friend's daughter is having an art exhibition in their courtyard house.

848
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:53,214
And he's inviting many friends.

849
00:51:53,214 --> 00:51:54,474
Art gallery celebration.

850
00:51:54,474 --> 00:51:56,954
There must be many young girls at the scene.

851
00:51:56,954 --> 00:52:01,508
Plus, with Ma Qiyuan's status as a wealthy bachelor,

852
00:52:01,508 --> 00:52:04,420
many girls would be interested in him.

853
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,994
The relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee has turned from one-on-one to one-to-many.

854
00:52:06,994 --> 00:52:08,634
The relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee has turned from one-on-one to one-to-many.

855
00:52:08,634 --> 00:52:10,434
If you don't stand out,

856
00:52:10,434 --> 00:52:12,334
you will be drowned out.

857
00:52:12,334 --> 00:52:13,514
By that time, this admission notice will be out of your reach.

858
00:52:13,514 --> 00:52:15,393
By that time, this admission notice will be out of your reach.

859
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:16,776
I understand.

860
00:52:16,776 --> 00:52:17,773
So this second interview is a group interview.

861
00:52:17,773 --> 00:52:20,352
So this second interview is a group interview.

862
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:23,386
So, I should dress to attract attention.

863
00:52:23,386 --> 00:52:25,113
The flashier and more brilliant, the better?

864
00:52:25,113 --> 00:52:28,233
As long as I catch the eye of my interviewer,

865
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:32,394
won't I be the shining star of the whole scene?

866
00:52:32,394 --> 00:52:33,344
You're wrong.

867
00:52:33,344 --> 00:52:35,474
Ma Qiyuan is looking for a colleague

868
00:52:35,474 --> 00:52:37,474
through a group interview, not a girl group member.

869
00:52:37,474 --> 00:52:39,416
through a group interview, not a girl group member.

870
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:40,574
In comparison, gentleness and wisdom are much more appealing than aggression.

871
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,273
In comparison, gentleness and wisdom are much more appealing than aggression.

872
00:52:43,273 --> 00:52:44,974
In comparison, gentleness and wisdom are much more appealing than aggression.

873
00:52:44,974 --> 00:52:46,194
So on that day, I have to be a woman

874
00:52:46,194 --> 00:52:49,314
So on that day, I have to be a woman

875
00:52:49,314 --> 00:52:53,276
who understands art and has a low profile.

876
00:52:53,914 --> 00:52:56,452
The weather is quite nice today.

877
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,764
But it's a bit too sunny.

878
00:53:08,588 --> 00:53:11,394
I'm telling you! I really want to meet him.

879
00:53:11,394 --> 00:53:12,594
I'm quite nervous.

880
00:53:12,594 --> 00:53:14,584
Who isn't?

881
00:53:18,074 --> 00:53:20,754
But I don't see him.

882
00:53:27,844 --> 00:53:30,144
Their style is quite unified.

883
00:53:33,224 --> 00:53:34,514
Why are you here?

884
00:53:34,514 --> 00:53:36,554
A friend invited me.

885
00:53:36,554 --> 00:53:38,294
Always telling me you're busy,

886
00:53:38,294 --> 00:53:40,733
but you're here messing around.

887
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:44,274
Aren't you messing around here, too?

888
00:53:45,074 --> 00:53:46,673
You seem to have a good eye.

889
00:53:46,673 --> 00:53:49,034
Accompany me to buy some stuff. Okay?

890
00:53:49,034 --> 00:53:51,136
Let's go, hurry up.

891
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:54,753
Hurry up, quickly.

892
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:56,736
You're doubting me, huh?

893
00:54:00,284 --> 00:54:03,336
I remember there should be some small shops around here.

894
00:54:03,336 --> 00:54:04,853
What kind of shops?

895
00:54:04,853 --> 00:54:06,880
Clothing shops.

896
00:54:07,496 --> 00:54:09,340
You'll know in a bit.

897
00:54:17,434 --> 00:54:20,764
This looks good. Let's give it a try.

898
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:25,673
Are you planning to change your style?

899
00:54:25,673 --> 00:54:27,233
Didn't you notice the girls just now?

900
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:29,073
They're all dressed similarly to me.

901
00:54:29,073 --> 00:54:31,374
How would I stand out?

902
00:54:31,374 --> 00:54:33,693
Is it a bit too exaggerated?

903
00:54:34,753 --> 00:54:35,914
Could you help me find a coat? I always feel this coat doesn't match well.

904
00:54:35,914 --> 00:54:38,432
Could you help me find a coat? I always feel this coat doesn't match well.

905
00:54:42,673 --> 00:54:46,408
This coat is too plain.

906
00:54:50,474 --> 00:54:52,900
The color scheme I'm wearing matches better.

907
00:54:55,313 --> 00:54:57,153
Indeed, it's not bad.

908
00:54:57,153 --> 00:55:00,114
However, cute girls only wear small sizes.

909
00:55:00,114 --> 00:55:01,474
Thank you.

910
00:55:01,474 --> 00:55:03,733
Please help me look carefully.

911
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:09,888
You're not changing clothes just because you wore

912
00:55:09,888 --> 00:55:11,514
the same style as everyone, are you?

913
00:55:11,514 --> 00:55:13,533
Of course.

914
00:55:13,533 --> 00:55:14,633
Do you not know it?

915
00:55:14,633 --> 00:55:17,980
Sometimes, clothes are not just clothes.

916
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:20,353
They are battle armor.

917
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:22,313
Battle armor?

918
00:55:22,313 --> 00:55:24,514
For which spoils of war?

919
00:55:24,514 --> 00:55:27,653
Of course, it's for someone very important.

920
00:55:33,753 --> 00:55:37,756
The total is 3,420.

921
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:40,992
Okay.

922
00:55:42,016 --> 00:55:43,848
Does it look good?

923
00:55:43,848 --> 00:55:45,636
Fantastic.

924
00:55:45,636 --> 00:55:47,194
That's good. Fantastic?

925
00:55:47,194 --> 00:55:49,674
Awesome, thank you.

926
00:55:49,674 --> 00:55:50,974
Actually, you'd look good in anything. No need to deliberately dress up like this.

927
00:55:50,974 --> 00:55:53,613
Actually, you'd look good in anything. No need to deliberately dress up like this.

928
00:56:03,392 --> 00:56:04,793
I'll contact you later.

929
00:56:04,793 --> 00:56:07,173
Goodbye, see you, we'll talk next time.

930
00:56:07,904 --> 00:56:09,792
Mr. Ma.

931
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:20,632
Ziquan.

932
00:56:24,136 --> 00:56:25,868
Was that your friend? Not going in together?

933
00:56:25,868 --> 00:56:26,912
Was that your friend? Not going in together?

934
00:56:26,912 --> 00:56:29,900
No, we just said hello.

935
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,008
Let's hurry in then. It's almost time.

936
00:56:31,008 --> 00:56:32,964
Let's hurry in then. It's almost time.

937
00:56:33,736 --> 00:56:35,560
Wait a moment.

938
00:56:38,664 --> 00:56:39,253
Can you accompany me to buy something?

939
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:43,016
Can you accompany me to buy something?

940
00:56:48,193 --> 00:56:49,984
Is it appropriate?

941
00:56:49,984 --> 00:56:52,254
[Dialogue Art Exhibition]

942
00:56:55,914 --> 00:56:58,414
My mom's friend also has a courtyard house like this.

943
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,680
It's just a bit smaller.

944
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,376
Guess how much?

945
00:57:02,376 --> 00:57:03,900
How much?

946
00:57:05,273 --> 00:57:08,153
About the market value of a small listed company.

947
00:57:08,153 --> 00:57:09,693
That's Beijing.

948
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:11,720
Filled with hidden talents.

949
00:57:13,248 --> 00:57:15,612
Do you see that uncle?

950
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,148
He's the owner of the courtyard, Old Zhang.

951
00:57:19,148 --> 00:57:22,374
I heard he has a deep background, a second generation.

952
00:57:22,374 --> 00:57:24,074
The person talking to him should be the chairman of Wanguo, Ma Qiyuan.

953
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:27,044
The person talking to him should be the chairman of Wanguo, Ma Qiyuan.

954
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:29,728
The one wearing the off-shoulder shirt on the side...

955
00:57:30,554 --> 00:57:32,513
should be his new girlfriend.

956
00:57:32,514 --> 00:57:35,588
At such a young age, she's attached herself to an uncle.

957
00:57:35,588 --> 00:57:37,340
Quite vain.

958
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,174
Xu Ziquan.

959
00:57:40,174 --> 00:57:42,548
You look quite handsome today.

960
00:57:42,548 --> 00:57:44,713
I thought you were only interested in contemporary art.

961
00:57:44,713 --> 00:57:46,713
Look at these flowers and birds. How vividly drawn.

962
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,140
Look at these flowers and birds. How vividly drawn.

963
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,893
I'm just looking around.

964
00:57:49,893 --> 00:57:51,074
These flowers and birds are all part of Old Zhang's collection.

965
00:57:51,074 --> 00:57:53,193
These flowers and birds are all part of Old Zhang's collection.

966
00:57:53,193 --> 00:57:55,068
Who is Old Zhang?

967
00:57:56,588 --> 00:57:57,614
That one.

968
00:57:57,614 --> 00:58:00,534
Look. He has vision, luck, and energy.

969
00:58:00,534 --> 00:58:02,714
Look. He has vision, luck, and energy.

970
00:58:02,714 --> 00:58:04,994
- Not at all.
- So impressive.

971
00:58:04,994 --> 00:58:06,914
I didn't see them at the auction.

972
00:58:06,914 --> 00:58:08,453
Tang Ying, look.

973
00:58:08,453 --> 00:58:09,920
The paintings here at Mr. Zhang's, each and every one is a masterpiece.

974
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,200
The paintings here at Mr. Zhang's, each and every one is a masterpiece.

975
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,152
Very rare.

976
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:17,434
Miss Tang, are you also interested in calligraphy and painting?

977
00:58:17,434 --> 00:58:18,574
Whose paintings do you like?

978
00:58:18,574 --> 00:58:22,554
Well, I'm just a novice.

979
00:58:22,554 --> 00:58:24,954
I dare not speak, afraid you'll laugh at me.

980
00:58:24,954 --> 00:58:26,084
Let's go in and take a look.

981
00:58:26,084 --> 00:58:27,914
Wait a moment, no rush.

982
00:58:27,914 --> 00:58:29,584
Then I'll say it.

983
00:58:29,584 --> 00:58:30,273
Actually, I think these painters have all been influenced by the landscape of the Sui and Tang dynasties.

984
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:33,034
Actually, I think these painters have all been influenced by the landscape of the Sui and Tang dynasties.

985
00:58:33,034 --> 00:58:35,793
Admiration and impact from one generation to the next are all passed down one by one.

986
00:58:35,793 --> 00:58:37,053
Admiration and impact from one generation to the next are all passed down one by one.

987
00:58:37,053 --> 00:58:38,753
We can't jump out of the entire era

988
00:58:38,753 --> 00:58:40,494
to evaluate any of them individually.

989
00:58:40,494 --> 00:58:42,893
Mr. Zhang, you mentioned Master Lin just now.

990
00:58:42,893 --> 00:58:44,174
Actually, I quite like him.

991
00:58:44,174 --> 00:58:45,954
Look at the bird painted by Master Lin.

992
00:58:45,954 --> 00:58:48,833
Its belly is round and plump, very cute.

993
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:50,654
Its belly is round and plump, very cute.

994
00:58:50,654 --> 00:58:52,594
But if you look closely,

995
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:55,876
I feel a bit of sadness.

996
00:58:55,876 --> 00:58:57,994
Surely, it has a beautiful name.

997
00:58:57,994 --> 00:58:59,874
Sleeping with the Wind.

998
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:01,728
Very romantic.

999
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,944
Let's go.

1000
00:59:06,464 --> 00:59:11,072
I didn't expect Miss Tang to have such a high level of artistic accomplishment.

1001
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:15,314
Mr. Ma, what a coincidence.

1002
00:59:15,314 --> 00:59:17,434
Long time no see.

1003
00:59:17,434 --> 00:59:18,848
Xu Ziquan from Jintou Xintai. Nice to meet you.

1004
00:59:18,848 --> 00:59:20,954
Xu Ziquan from Jintou Xintai. Nice to meet you.

1005
00:59:20,954 --> 00:59:22,793
We had a project together before.

1006
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:24,494
- Hello, hello.
- Hello, hello.

1007
00:59:26,153 --> 00:59:28,516
Mr. Ma's girlfriend is really beautiful.

1008
00:59:28,516 --> 00:59:30,713
No, she's my legal advisor, a lawyer, Tang Ying.

1009
00:59:30,713 --> 00:59:32,244
No, she's my legal advisor, a lawyer, Tang Ying.

1010
00:59:32,244 --> 00:59:34,574
I'm sorry, I assumed.

1011
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:36,574
I won't bother you any longer.

1012
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:38,632
I'll just look around.

1013
00:59:44,932 --> 00:59:48,552
I'll give you Master Lin's bird.

1014
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,333
This off-shoulder girl is quite impressive.

1015
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,214
I originally thought she was just Ma Qiyuan's dessert after dinner

1016
01:00:06,214 --> 01:00:09,713
or a small strawberry on the dessert.

1017
01:00:09,713 --> 01:00:11,633
I didn't expect her to not only be articulate, brave, and meticulous,

1018
01:00:11,633 --> 01:00:13,468
I didn't expect her to not only be articulate, brave, and meticulous,

1019
01:00:13,468 --> 01:00:16,644
but also earnestly represent Ma's business.

1020
01:00:16,644 --> 01:00:20,032
It seems that tonight will be fruitful.

♫ If we're really, truly blessed in our life, I want to feel alive ♫

1038
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:32,080
♫ If your hopes, they make you blind, will find a way ♫

1039
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:35,700
♫ I'll find a way ♫

1040
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,620
♫ I will find a way ♫
