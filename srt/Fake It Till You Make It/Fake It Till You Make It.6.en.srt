You're in great condition.

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,740
Come on, I've aged.

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,680
You changed your dressing style,

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
but I guess you kept your rebellious spirit.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,520
but I guess you kept your rebellious spirit.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,012
You can't change who you are.

12
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:34,020
- Hello.
- Tang, come to my office.

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,820

Hello, I'm Tang Ying.

We put in some serious effort to get Miss Wang here.

We put in some serious effort to get Miss Wang here.

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,380
She's taking the place of your former leader.

So if you're not busy today,

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,019
So if you're not busy today,

24
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,560
show her around for me.

25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,240
show her around for me.

29
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,380
This is your office.

30
00:01:56,779 --> 00:02:00,000
Miss Wang, were you aware that we'd be colleagues that day?

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,080
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you tell me then?

32
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,460
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you tell me then?

33
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,499
Then I would have missed that expression.

34
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,580
Okay, business first.

35
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,620
Tell me about your personnel.

36
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,919
All right.

37
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,919
Mr. Zheng has two senior lawyers, you and Miss Han.

38
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,159
Mr. Zheng has two senior lawyers, you and Miss Han.

39
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,020
Mr. Zheng has two senior lawyers, you and Miss Han.

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,319
Before Miss Wang left, she only had me and Wang Yu, an intern.

41
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,319
Before Miss Wang left, she only had me and Wang Yu, an intern.

42
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,460
Before Miss Wang left, she only had me and Wang Yu, an intern.

43
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,480
All the others went to Miss Han's team.

44
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,759
Because Miss Han lacked people for the heavy workload.

45
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,700
Because Miss Han lacked people for the heavy workload.

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,320
Once Miss Wang left, Wang Yu also went there.

47
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,620
Once Miss Wang left, Wang Yu also went there.

48
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,600
Wang Yu also went there.

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,379
So with great honor, I'm the only one on your team.

50
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,919
So tell me about the cases you were working on.

51
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,399
So tell me about the cases you were working on.

52
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:42,840
I was working on an M&A case. It fell through.

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,879
Miss Wang wasn't doing so well and was slacking off.

54
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,039
Miss Wang wasn't doing so well and was slacking off.

55
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,520
So we only had some package billing cases of business tycoons.

56
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,540
So we only had some package billing cases of business tycoons.

57
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,140
There was much trivial work and very little income.

58
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,020
There was much trivial work and very little income.

59
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,580
Especially Geer Group's legal specialist Liu Meiling…

60
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,960
Liu Meiling?

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,799
- You know her?
- She's my junior.

62
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,700
- You know her?
- She's my junior.

63
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,360
But we haven't met for years.

64
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,300
She's real trouble.

65
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,160
It sounds like we're quite stuck in misery.

66
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,940
It sounds like we're quite stuck in misery.

67
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,139
It sounds like we're quite stuck in misery.

68
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:14,179
But thankfully, I like challenges.

69
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:17,139
Sort out the files and archives of our clients

70
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,619
and bring them to me later.

71
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:21,280
You're already pumped up?

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,779
We're doomed if we don't hurry up.

73
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:25,899
All right. You got this.

74
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:28,548
All right. You got this.

75
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,219
My new supervisor reminds me of you.

76
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:35,860
Overly nice and kind to everyone.

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,456
You like her?

78
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,059
We just met. I can't tell for now.

79
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:43,700
But it's quite distinctive.

80
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,260
I think we can be friends.

81
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,520
It's a pity…

82
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,400
Not as handsome as me?

83
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:03,059
Not as shameless as you for sure.

84
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:05,319
Any plans after work?

85
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,080
I'm swamped with work today.

86
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,700
It's overwhelming. Rain check.

87
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,380
Leave them here.

88
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,360
These are the hardcopies of the archives.

89
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,279
I also sent them to you via email.

90
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,979
I'll leave you to it.

91
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:38,439
Wait. I may not come to the firm every day.

92
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,519
Wait. I may not come to the firm every day.

93

Okay. Anything else?

Okay. Anything else?

101
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,879
I prioritize efficiency.

102
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,260
I prioritize efficiency.

103

Lawyers work by billable hours.

104
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,480
So we must finish our work with great efficiency in the shortest time.

Have you heard of this?

109
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,700
What?

110
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,199
Keep telling yourself that your time is valuable.

Keep telling yourself that your time is valuable.

112
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:09,680
Then you will cherish your time and improve your efficiency.

113

Then you will cherish your time and improve your efficiency.

Fine. Send me the address. Now.

I didn't expect that we'd be partners.

I didn't expect that we'd be partners.

147

He makes me feel dumb and easy to fool.

154

He makes me feel dumb and easy to fool.

155
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,500
In the beginning, he was less responsive to my messages.

156
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,739
Then he was late for our dates.

157
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:18,220
Now he doesn't even show up.

158
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,180

Some guys date two girls at the same time and the dates overlap.

164
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,480
The guy would be sweet and book a spa session for the girl.

165
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,619
The guy would be sweet and book a spa session for the girl.

166

I call this a strategic buffer.

I call this a strategic buffer.

168
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,079
No way. He wouldn't dare.

169
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:57,739
Has he made an appointment here before?

170
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:58,960
No.

Relax. Lie down.

Miss Meiling, this place is known for its signature Tom Yum soup.

180
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,080
Miss Meiling, this place is known for its signature Tom Yum soup.

181
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,099
Thanks.

182
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:28,712
Have some.

183
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:29,539
- You too.
- Okay.

184
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:31,084
- You too.
- Okay.

185
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,020
There's something wrong with their lemongrass and chili pepper.

186
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,200
There's something wrong with their lemongrass and chili pepper.

187
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,600
There's something wrong with their lemongrass and chili pepper.

188
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,679
Of course.

189
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,940
It's enough to trick the amateurs.

190
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,939
It's enough to trick the amateurs.

191
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,920
What about the lemongrass?

192
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,360
It just tastes wrong.

193
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,720
Tang, once you're familiar with the authentic flavor, it forms a memory,

194
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,840
Tang, once you're familiar with the authentic flavor, it forms a memory,

195
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,880
especially on your tongue.

196
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,900
It's really clear.

197
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,159
But it's kind of impossible to illustrate with words.

198
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:10,079
But it's kind of impossible to illustrate with words.

199
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,879
I tried it.

200
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,519
They use Chinese lemongrass. So it's slightly acerbic.

201
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,320
They use Chinese lemongrass. So it's slightly acerbic.

202
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,440
You know what?

203
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Back when I was studying in France,

204
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,859
I discussed with a Thai Michelin chef about the lemongrass of each country.

205
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:23,859
I discussed with a Thai Michelin chef about the lemongrass of each country.

206
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:25,679
I discussed with a Thai Michelin chef about the lemongrass of each country.

207
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,880
The European lemongrass is relatively sour.

208
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,300
The Vietnamese lemongrass is sour-sweet.

209
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,779
Let alone Chinese chefs, even Thai chefs may not be able to say

210
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,120
Let alone Chinese chefs, even Thai chefs may not be able to say

211
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,440
Let alone Chinese chefs, even Thai chefs may not be able to say

212
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,639
which country's lemongrass is the most authentic.

213
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,860
which country's lemongrass is the most authentic.

214
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,900
Amazing. You're both awesome.

215
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,980
Amazing. You're both awesome.

216
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,459
I don't understand anything.

217
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:57,719
I think it's probably my problem.

218
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:00,240
I think it's probably my problem.

219
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,319
My taste buds worship foreign foods.

220
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:03,759
My taste buds worship foreign foods.

221
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,939
This is not good.

222
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,399
Maybe I'm used to the European lemongrass

223
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,939
Maybe I'm used to the European lemongrass

224
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:11,019
and I have to get used to the Chinese lemongrass.

225
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,959
and I have to get used to the Chinese lemongrass.

226
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,120
Meiling,

227
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,680
European lemongrass is just a term I made up.

228
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,480
European lemongrass is just a term I made up.

229
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,280
Sorry.

230
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,819
Miss Wang,

231
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:36,919
after all, Liu Meiling is our client.

232
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,700
after all, Liu Meiling is our client.

233
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,639
Aren't you worried she'll hold grudges and give us a hard time?

234
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,680
Not a chance.

235
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,039
I know too well about her sordid past.

236
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,260
I know too well about her sordid past.

237
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,600
She wouldn't dare offend me.

238
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,780
"Hold grudges"?

239
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,220
What if she replaces us?

240
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,759
Our team is already quite miserable.

241
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,060
Our team is already quite miserable.

242
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,080
Anyway, the best way to maintain customer relations is not to please them.

243
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,540
Anyway, the best way to maintain customer relations is not to please them.

244
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,439
We should discipline them.

245
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:03,340
Discipline?

246
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,800
Doesn't it sound a bit too intimate?

247
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,620
Doesn't it sound a bit too intimate?

248
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,960
You have no idea.

249
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,020
Listen. A client and a vendor are like a man and a woman in a relationship.

250
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,799
Listen. A client and a vendor are like a man and a woman in a relationship.

251
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,080
Listen. A client and a vendor are like a man and a woman in a relationship.

252
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,739
Listen. A client and a vendor are like a man and a woman in a relationship.

253
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,879
To make it last, we should know each other's bottom line and try to get along for better communication.

254
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,240
To make it last, we should know each other's bottom line and try to get along for better communication.

255
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,480
To make it last, we should know each other's bottom line and try to get along for better communication.

256
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,640
To make it last, we should know each other's bottom line and try to get along for better communication.

257
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,680
After a while, we will know each other the best.

258
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,020
After a while, we will know each other the best.

259
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,039
After a while, we will know each other the best.

260
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,480
Then, no one can replace us in this relationship.

261
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,540
Then, no one can replace us in this relationship.

262
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,659
Got it.

263
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,060
Starting tomorrow, I'll discipline Liu Meiling.

264
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,940
Starting tomorrow, I'll discipline Liu Meiling.

265
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,120
Right, what was Liu Meiling's sordid past?

266
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,740
Right, what was Liu Meiling's sordid past?

267
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,300
Look how nosy you are.

268
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,679
It's just a thing between a dentist and her.

269
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,799
- She did tell me how he pursued her romantically.
- "Pursue her"?

270
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,240
- She did tell me how he pursued her romantically.
- "Pursue her"?

271
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,680
- She did tell me how he pursued her romantically.
- "Pursue her"?

272
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,919
That's what she told you?

273
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,120
Isn't that the truth?

274
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,399
That dentist was indeed pursuing a college girl.

275
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,000
That dentist was indeed pursuing a college girl.

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,240
But that college girl wasn't her.

277
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,280
But that college girl wasn't her.

278
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,320
It was her roommate.

279
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,340
And?

280
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,440
And Liu Meiling figured out what he wanted.

281
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,759
And Liu Meiling figured out what he wanted.

282
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,960
So she volunteered to help him get her roommate.

283
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,779
So she volunteered to help him get her roommate.

284
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,360
They got close during the process.

285
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,119
She offered to "help".

286
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,679
The matchmaker became the bride.

287
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,879
So is her husband sweet to her?

288
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,239
- I think they were happy at first.
- And then?

289
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,039
- I think they were happy at first.
- And then?

290
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,679
I heard that the dentist was having an affair.

291
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:11,590
[I'm swamped with work today. It's overwhelming. Rain check.]

292
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,760
Timing is such an important thing.

293
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,180
We take the initiative once.

294
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,260
Then we're embarrassed to take the initiative again.

295
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,760
Then we're embarrassed to take the initiative again.

296
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,620
The passion, the desire to talk,

297
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,320
and the impulse of getting closer

298
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,840
are all gone in an instant.

299
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,704
[I'm swamped with work today. It's overwhelming. Rain check.]

300
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,700
Richard wants a meeting tomorrow.

301
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,059
I bet it's about the allocation.

302
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,860
It's inevitable.

303
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,380
Anbei District lacks potential clients

304
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,000
and ranks last in performance these years.

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,640
Our whole year's effort is in vain if we're assigned to the old industrial zone.

306
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,840
Our whole year's effort is in vain if we're assigned to the old industrial zone.

307
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,679
All right, I see.

308
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,200
The Walrus case fell through...

309
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,100
The Walrus case fell through...

310
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,620
mainly due to inadequate risk prediction and lack of experience.

311
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,420
mainly due to inadequate risk prediction and lack of experience.

312
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,779
But I understand. Projects can go wrong.

313
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,859
It's inevitable.

314
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,159
Do not feel timid because of one failure.

315
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,340
Do not feel timid because of one failure.

316
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,136
On the contrary,

317
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:53,160
be bolder and more careful.

318
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:59,559
Also, I've informed each department of the regional allocation for the next season.

319
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,400
Also, I've informed each department of the regional allocation for the next season.

320
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,039
Right now, you should stay focused

321
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,920
Right now, you should stay focused

322
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,419
on your work at hand.

323
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:08,699
Okay.

324
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,860
We're clear about the labor division.

325
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,639
That's it for today.

326
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,260
Dismissed.

327
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,240
Xu Ziquan, Jin Hao, and Jiang Cheng, stay.

328
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,059
We have three business regions.

329
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:35,280
Claim the ones you want.

330
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:46,254
[Anbei District]

331
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,400
Richard, I volunteer to go to Anbei District.

332
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:09,559
All right, then.

333
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:12,519
I'll take the areas around Beijing.

334
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,979
Healthy competition, get it?

335
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,759
A team should be on the same page.

336
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,419
A team should be on the same page.

337
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:22,720
Richard.

338
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,360
- Your call.
- Please calm down.

339
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,459
It's my fault that the project failed.

340
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:33,600
I was reckless. I'm sorry.

341
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,740
Amazing.

342
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,660
What's amazing?

343
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,980
What about the complaints of the Jiangsu client?

344
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,540
The problem is still not solved.

345
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,799
What's wrong with the model of the Taiwanese client?

346
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,120
What's wrong with the model of the Taiwanese client?

347
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,679
Richard, easy.

348
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,659
Jin Hao, leave us here.

349
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,419
Richard, I've worked under you for five years.

350
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:15,080
Don't you always say that

351
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,060
setbacks can be opportunities?

352
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,459
Anbei District may not be bad for me.

00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,159
The third time, you came to feed the cats under my building.

530
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,900
There's one more. Want it?

531
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,680
The fourth time was just now...

532
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,480
The fourth time was just now...

533
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,219
when I suddenly heard your voice.

534
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,132
Tang Ying.

535
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,459
Those are things

536
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,739
we should say in person.

537
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:30,080
- Where are—
- It doesn't matter.

538
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,179
- Where are—
- It doesn't matter.

539
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:34,400
I just want to tell you that

540
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,640
I won't admit it if I'm truly tempted.

541
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,319
But I'm admitting it.

542
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,580
Because it doesn't matter anymore.

543
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,259
That's why I'm confessing.

544
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,119
We agreed to be friends, anyway.

545
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:50,059
We agreed to be friends, anyway.

546
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:52,000
We're wearing the friendship rings.

547
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,119
I won't be randomly tempted.

548
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,700
I'm just telling you my feelings as jokes to entertain you.

549
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,780
I'm just telling you my feelings as jokes to entertain you.

550
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,580
I'm just telling you my feelings as jokes to entertain you.

551
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,300
We're still friends.

552
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,956
Okay?

553
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,628
That's it?

554
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,896
That's it.

555
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,019
You may be a playboy,

556
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,419
but you're a good man.

557
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:28,160
And you're excellent.

558
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,119
It's normal for me to be tempted. Right?

559
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,799
But I've learned to contain myself.

560
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,119
But I've learned to contain myself.

561
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,119
Whenever I lose it, I'll tell you.

562
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,220
Whenever I lose it, I'll tell you.

563
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,520
Think of it as a joke and laugh.

564
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:42,440
That's good.

565
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,459
It's like payback to you

566
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:46,499
for getting me that pricy friendship ring.

567
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:49,040
for getting me that pricy friendship ring.

568
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,820
What about you, Xu Ziquan?

569
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:20,060
Have you ever felt tempted by me at a certain moment?

570
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,900
Have you ever felt tempted by me at a certain moment?

571
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,720
It's okay. Tell me about it.

572
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,160
Anyway, I'm an independent woman in the prime of youth

573
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,680
Anyway, I'm an independent woman in the prime of youth

574
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,300
who gives off her damned charm by mistake.

575
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,499
It's normal for you to lose control.

576
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:46,132
No.

577
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,479
I have a question.

578
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,839
Tell me?

579
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,519
When did you start liking me?

580
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:34,939
When did you start liking me?

581
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,060
During that public lecture.

582
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,368
Don't you know?

583
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:40,419
So early?

584
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:42,880
Of course. How can you not know?

585
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,100
I should have made you guess.

586
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,420
You fool.

587
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,759
Indeed,

588
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,580
I won't confess the real moment when I plunged into love.

589
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,720
So I will never tell him about the moment

590
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,219
when I stood in the pitch-dark passageway,

591
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,739
looking down to see him by the lamppost

592
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,400
after he drove me home.

593
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,060
Come to my office.

594
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,884
Sit.

595
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,880
Judging from our current situation, we can't count on the clients at hand.

596
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,279
Judging from our current situation, we can't count on the clients at hand.

597
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,520
Judging from our current situation, we can't count on the clients at hand.

598
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,759
Meanwhile, Han Han won't let go of her clients.

599
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:51,040
Meanwhile, Han Han won't let go of her clients.

600
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,520
So we must try something else.

601
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,920
Like what?

602
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,200
Charter into a new path. Develop new clients.

603
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,620
Charter into a new path. Develop new clients.

604
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,580
Look into the legal issues of emerging industries,

605
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,560
Look into the legal issues of emerging industries,

606
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,219
combine them into magazines with business information,

607
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:02,679
combine them into magazines with business information,

608
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:05,599
and send them to our potential clients every week.

609
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,056
All right.

610
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,960
Hey, Mr. Zeng. This is Ziquan.

611
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,860
Hey, Mr. Zeng. This is Ziquan.

612
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,500
You said that your friend's company wanted to go public last time.

613
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,000
You said that your friend's company wanted to go public last time.

614
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,900
Shall we meet over dinner and talk about it?

615
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,900
This is Tang Ying.

616
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,720
Have you received the industry newsletter?

617
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,920
You're not a legal specialist in Green Hill Group now?

618
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,940
You're not a legal specialist in Green Hill Group now?

619
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,140
Are you planning to get another round of financing soon?

620
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,720
Are you planning to get another round of financing soon?

621
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

622
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,180
Yeah, I made the newsletter.

623
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,279
If it's fine by you, please forward it to your friends in need.

624
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,824
If it's fine by you, please forward it to your friends in need.

625
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:34,848
Brother Li, this is Xu Ziquan.

626
00:31:34,848 --> 00:31:35,740
Brother Li, this is Xu Ziquan.

627
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,000
We met at the industry fair.

628
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,979
Shall we meet someday?

629
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:43,480
Mr. Mo, I'm just calling to ask if you received the industry newsletter.

630
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,159
Mr. Mo, I'm just calling to ask if you received the industry newsletter.

631
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,820
You changed your profession?

632
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,400
Movies and television?

633
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,219
That's a booming business.

634
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:54,420
All right.

635
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,480
Thank you.

636
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,079
I'm too exhausted to wonder whether that good friendhe mentioned was me.

637
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,160
I'm too exhausted to wonder whether that good friend he mentioned was me.

638
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,280
I'm too exhausted to wonder whether that good friend he mentioned was me.

639
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,039
I don't know how many pairs of friendship rings he has.

640
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,380
I don't know how many pairs of friendship rings he has.

641
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,419
I don't know how many times he has written

642
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,279
I don't know how many times he has written

643
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,539
that perfume name on a girl's palm.

644
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:45,599
Neither do I know how many girls he's flirting with.

645
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,780
Neither do I know how many girls he's flirting with.

646
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,839
All I know is that I'm really tired.

647
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,599
Sis.

648
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:06,460
Why are you so late?

649
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,400
It's been a whole day. Were you out for a sneaky date?

650
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,620
It's been a whole day. Were you out for a sneaky date?

651
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,180
I wish.

652
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,620
Here.

653
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,599
What's wrong? You're acting weird.

654
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,400
Snacks ready.

655
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Drinks ready.

656
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,360
- You're acting weird. Something's up.
- Sit down, please.

657
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,519
Go ahead. What do you want from me?

658
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,640
Sis, you probably won't have to take me in anymore.

659
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,820
Sis, you probably won't have to take me in anymore.

660
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,580
Xu Jiabai gave me a gift today.

661
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:51,620
Xinzi, it's me.

662
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,159
I apologize for that day.

663
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,820
I can show you my phone if you want.

664
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,500
I can unlock it.

665
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,160
I won't check your phone.

666
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,419
I bet you deleted everything.

667
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:06,040
So tell me. What should I do for you to forgive me?

668
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,260
Figure it out yourself.

669
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,900
What are you busy with?

670
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,520
Why do you answer my messages so late?

671
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,960
Xinzi, I swear I'm 100% honest with you.

672
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,099
Xinzi, I swear I'm 100% honest with you.

673
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:18,059
Check my phone. Check my PC.

674
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,440
If we ever fight again, it's always my fault.

675
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,720
If we ever fight again, it's always my fault.

676
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,519
Stop being mad at me. Okay?

677
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,820
Is that what I'm asking?

678
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,700
I'm asking what you've been doing.

679
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,419
Nothing.

680
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:30,680
- Baby.
- You won't tell me, huh?
- That isn't it.

681
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,599
Fine. Let's end it here.

682
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:35,000
Wait. What are you talking about?

683
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,660
- You're a hypocrite.
- What do you mean?

684
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:43,100
Baby. Sweetheart. Xinzi.

685
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,240
Let go.

686
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,419
Don't be mad.

687
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,320
Why are you so mad?

688
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,719
You made so many mistakes. Why can't I be mad?

689
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,660
You made so many mistakes. Why can't I be mad?

690
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,280
I promise you'll see what I've been busy with.

691
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,400
I promise you'll see what I've been busy with.

692
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,740
This is a gift for you.

693
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,660
I don't know if you like it.

694
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:22,080
This…

695
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:23,900
- Dumbfounded?
- This…

696
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,720
- Dumbfounded?
- This…

697
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,820
This is a gift for me?

698
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,859
Of course, it's for you.

699
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,340
You're so silly.

700
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,820
Why didn't you tell me?

701
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,300
I'm willing to do anything for you.

702
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,160
Give me your hand.

703
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,920
From now on, this is our home.

704
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,640
From now on, this is our home.

705
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,016
Keep it.

706
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,428
Wait.

707
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,720
It's hot. Give me a second.

708
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,059
An apartment.

709
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,520
Is he loaded?

710
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,579
He gave you an apartment just like that?

711
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:29,820
He got residence last year.

712
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,400
His parents gave him money to get an apartment.

713
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,420
He planned to get one in Beijing.

714
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,719
But it'd be a two-bedroom one in the suburbs.

715
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,120
But it'd be a two-bedroom one in the suburbs.

716
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,219
But I didn't know that he'd buy the apartment here for me.

717
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:42,260
But I didn't know that he'd buy the apartment here for me.

718
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,320
Are you going to miss me?

719
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,959
Of course.

720
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,720
But are you really moving over?

721
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,599
I just feel that you just got serious.

722
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,020
I just feel that you just got serious.

723
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,979
Isn't it a bit too soon?

724
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:06,820
It's a "trial marriage."

725
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,580
It's common.

726
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,880
Think about it. New couples always try to present their better selves.

727
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,059
Think about it. New couples always try to present their better selves.

728
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:15,820
And they're full of fantasies.

729
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,160
They may not get to know each other for years.

730
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,140
They may not get to know each other for years.

731
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,040
But the most ordinary life shatters those fantasies

732
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,640
But the most ordinary life shatters those fantasies

733
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,960
and brings back reality to show you if someone is meant for you

734
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,900
and brings back reality to show you if someone is meant for you

735
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,840
and if you should be together forever.

736
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,899
Anyway, you're always full of theories.

737
00:37:28,899 --> 00:37:31,200
Anyway, you're always full of theories.

738
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,600
You won't take my advice. So I won't bother.

739
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,099
You won't take my advice. So I won't bother.

740
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:37,499
Go ahead.

741
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:39,920
My name is not written on the title deed.

742
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,320
My name is not written on the title deed.

743
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,979
But he said it was a gift for me.

744
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:47,560
It made me so happy.

745
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,120
Besides, I don't have to pay the rent.

746
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,279
And it's only ten minutes away from work.

747
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:55,100
He covers all the daily expenses.

748
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,639
I get to save time, energy, and money.

749
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,099
I get to save time, energy, and money.

750
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:00,280
I thought you were overwhelmed by the emotions

751
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,240
I thought you were overwhelmed by the emotions

752
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,100
and forgot about real life.

753
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,240
I didn't know our little fairy would be so shrewd.

754
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,260
I didn't know our little fairy would be so shrewd.

755
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,620
I'm not a fairy.

756
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,840
It's just that we want different things.

757
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,000
You want pure romance.

758
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,540
I just want to marry someone and live an ordinary life.

759
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,580
I just want to marry someone and live an ordinary life.

760
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,379
But he's too silly when it comes to buying the house.

761
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:24,160
But he's too silly when it comes to buying the house.

762
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:26,159
You were just praising him.

763
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:28,260
How is he silly now?

764
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,940
Think about it.

765
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,240
If he really wants to marry me,

766
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,559
he should talk to me about getting the house. Right?

767
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,320
he should talk to me about getting the house. Right?

768
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,440
We should search for something

769
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,140
that's more livable or has room for appreciation

770
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,719
instead of letting him be a fool and getting a one-bedroom apartment in CBD.

771
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,900
instead of letting him be a fool and getting a one-bedroom apartment in CBD.

772
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,639
What should we do when we're married and have kids?

773
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,619
What should we do when we're married and have kids?

774
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:51,860
It's not a school district house and it's too small.

775
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,740
I also consulted my colleagues.

776
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,060
They said the house price is at its peak.

777
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,340
That neighborhood is old.

778
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,419
There's no room for appreciation.

779
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:01,180
If that's the best he can do about financial management,

780
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,760
If that's the best he can do about financial management,

781
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,620
aren't we going to get poorer and poorer?

782
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,379
You haven't even moved there,

783
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:08,220
but you're thinking well into the future.

784
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,239
Well, if you're really so aggrieved, don't move away.

785
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,280
Well, if you're really so aggrieved, don't move away.

786
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,560
Well, if you're really so aggrieved, don't move away.

787
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,979
Well, if you're really so aggrieved, don't move away.

788
00:39:12,979 --> 00:39:15,039
Break up with him.

789
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,199
He's too silly.

790
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:21,220
I'm just talking mean.

791
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,579
Stop roasting me.

792
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,099
He's so nice to me.

793
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,579
How can I let him go?

794
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:30,040
Cherish him.

795
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,499
I would never let him go.

796
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,059
One more layer.

797
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:45,920
- Be careful.
- It's okay.

798
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,536
Hold it tight.

799
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,060
Here. One more.

800
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,760
Okay, it's well packed.

801
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,240
Sis, thanks for letting me stay for so many days.

802
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:06,159
Hurry up and leave.

803
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:09,260
You're stopping me from finding nice guys.

804
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,380
If he dares to bully you, come back any time.

805
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,979
I'm always here.

806
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,119
Get lost, kiddo.

807
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,540
You want to get married so young?

808
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,752
I'm leaving.

809
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,960
I'll get the door. Leave them here.

810
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,744
I'll get the door. Leave them here.

811
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,680
Right, I forwarded you an email. Take a look.

812
00:40:59,421 --> 00:41:01,964
[Wanguo]

813
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:04,340
Wanguo again?

814
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,459
Mr. Zheng is torturing me.

815
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:09,320
Tell me. Did we just lose a cross-border M&A case recently?

816
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,419
Tell me. Did we just lose a cross-border M&A case recently?

817
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:13,660
Are these the original files of the case?

818
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,719
Thankfully, I went through the emails.

819
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:16,920
I heard you worked hard on this case.

820
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,159
I heard you worked hard on this case.

821
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:19,979
So, do you remember it?

822
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:21,880
I translated everything in this case.

823
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,199
I translated everything in this case.

824
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,820
I'd remember everything even if they were burned into ashes.

825
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,099
I'd remember everything even if they were burned into ashes.

826
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:28,940
But are we really going to do it?

827
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,160
Even Mr. Zheng gave up.

828
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,320
That's because he hasn't met a challenge seeker like me.

829
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,940
That's because he hasn't met a challenge seeker like me.

830
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,220
This case will make us at least two million.

831
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,800
Only a fool would miss it.

832
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,140
Come up with a plan.

833
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,459
Tomorrow. Is that okay?

834
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:44,244
I'll try.

835
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,679
Boss, I'm off. Don't stay too late.

836
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,200
Boss, I'm off. Don't stay too late.

837
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,720
Okay, take care.

838
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,156
Okay.

839
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:39,400
You're here?

840
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,719
Han Han is making a move once she hears our plan. We must hurry.

841
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,560
Han Han is making a move once she hears our plan. We must hurry.

842
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,700
She also has a proposal?

843
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,159
Yeah, get your things. Let's present our proposal.

844
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,400
Yeah, get your things. Let's present our proposal.

845
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,920
I sent it to you last night.

846
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,139
Did you see it? Is it okay?

847
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,472
Let's go.

848
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,184
Excuse me.

849
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,440
Mr. Zheng, I've studied the client's needs in detail.

850
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,599
Mr. Zheng, I've studied the client's needs in detail.

851
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,180
Mr. Zheng, I've studied the client's needs in detail.

852
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,199
I've also summarized all the mistakes and drawn lessons from the case with Guo Yu.

853
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,600
I've also summarized all the mistakes and drawn lessons from the case with Guo Yu.

854
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,619
To be honest, it's not easy for our team to handle the case

855
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,360
To be honest, it's not easy for our team to handle the case

856
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,360
To be honest, it's not easy for our team to handle the case

857
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,800
all by ourselves at this point.

858
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,820
all by ourselves at this point.

859
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,179
I have a proposal.

860
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:31,220
Can we find a subcontractor?

861
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,260
Can we find a subcontractor?

862
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,519
I contacted Zerui, my classmate's team.

863
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:36,360
I contacted Zerui, my classmate's team.

864
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,199
They're highly experienced in cross-border M&A

865
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,400
They're highly experienced in cross-border M&A

866
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,099
and they're willing to work with us.

867
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:42,400
Isn't it easier for us to work with them?

868
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,740
Isn't it easier for us to work with them?

869
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,220
The profit sharing is up for negotiation.

870
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm sure we'll get a good deal since I'm here.

871
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,059
What do you think?

872
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,019
Mr. Zheng, have you read the quotation?

873
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:02,996
Quotation?

874
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:07,000
I've listed the legal issues, billing hours,

875
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,360
I've listed the legal issues, billing hours,

876
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,679
and our team members in the file I sent to you.

877
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:10,960
and our team members in the file I sent to you.

878
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,400
Estimated cost, 2.1 million. Is that okay?

879
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,000
Estimated cost, 2.1 million. Is that okay?

880
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,719
What quotation?

881
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,940
Go ahead and send it to Wanguo.

882
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,560
Okay.

883
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:23,220
- Done.
- Okay.

884
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,876
- Done.
- Okay.

885
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,952
Close the door.

886
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,160
How did you know that your plan would work?

887
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,599
How did you know that your plan would work?

888
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,700
Come on, tell me.

889
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,119
You have two subordinates.

890
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,039
One says that she's going to share the cake with others.

891
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:50,199
One says that she's going to share the cake with others.

892
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:51,540
The other says that she can eat the whole cake.

893
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,380
The other says that she can eat the whole cake.

894
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,579
Who would you choose as the boss?

895
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,600
You must be an expert in cross-border M&A and corporation law.

896
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,340
You must be an expert in cross-border M&A and corporation law.

897
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,180
I'm trying to be.

898
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:05,119
Besides, I have you.

899
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,660
You're smarter and more diligent than Guo Yu.

900
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,880
Besides, you handled all the material of this case.

901
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,520
Besides, you handled all the material of this case.

902
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,800
The way I see it, this case belongs to us.

903
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,199
The way I see it, this case belongs to us.

904
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:16,759
Your proficiency makes you really daring.

905
00:45:16,759 --> 00:45:17,419
- This is…
- I sent you some files I got

906
00:45:17,419 --> 00:45:18,900
- This is…
- I sent you some files I got

907
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,360
from my classmate who majored in cross-border M&A.

908
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,199
Check them out. It's not that complicated.

909
00:45:25,712 --> 00:45:27,579
[File]

910
00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:29,680
Will we make it?

911
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,360
Don't chicken out. Okay?

912
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,139
All lawyers learn through work.

913
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:35,940
Next Monday. 10:00 in the morning.

914
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,920
Get me the biggest conference room.

915
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,380
I'll invite Wanguo's CEO here.

916
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,839
Pull yourself together. Get ready.

917
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:44,800
Okay.

918
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,300
Why am I scared if you're not?

919
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,000
Go home if you're done.

920
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,180
You're not forced to stay.

921
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,340
It's fine. No rush.

922
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:14,940
I don't even want to go home ever since my sister left.

923
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,239
I don't even want to go home ever since my sister left.

924
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:19,679
People are really strange.

925
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:21,280
When she was home, I found her annoying.

926
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,980
When she was home, I found her annoying.

927
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,879
But now that she's gone,

928
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:27,640
I miss her a lot.

929
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:34,719
- Sis, do you feel hollow and lonely when you're at home alone?
- Yeah.

930
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:35,720
- Sis, do you feel hollow and lonely when you're at home alone?
- Yeah.

931
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,812
- Sis, do you feel hollow and lonely when you're at home alone?
- Yeah.

932
00:46:37,812 --> 00:46:38,440
- Sis, do you feel hollow and lonely when you're at home alone?
- Yeah.

933
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,119
How do you deal with it?

934
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:41,800
Get a cat.

935
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
You got one?

936
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,139
I got a third one this year.

937
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,800
Cube of loneliness.

938
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,360
You're really lonely.

939
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,500
Old Xu.

940
00:47:00,939 --> 00:47:03,119
Where did you get it?

941
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,679
I brought it to Richard. He wasn't there.

942
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:06,479
Try some.

943
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,619
I know you're upset.

944
00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:13,880
But even if we're in adversity,

945
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,979
we have to move forward. Right?

946
00:47:15,979 --> 00:47:18,159
How do you say it?

947
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:20,119
Even King Goujian of Yue had to suffer.

948
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:22,620
Even Sun Bin crawled beneath someone's crotch.

949
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,359
That was Han Xin.

950
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,700
A minor mistake.

951
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,640
Wait.

952
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,419
I don't think you're bothered at all.

953
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:37,800
Do I look bothered?

954
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,200
Do I look bothered?

955
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,160
You don't need my condolence.

956
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:47,240
I'm leaving next week.

957
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,524
Anbei Industrial District?

958
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,020
You're really going there?

959
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,300
What can you do there?

960
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,760
How do I know if I don't go there?

961
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,560
Besides, the seniors are watching us.

962
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,640
Besides, the seniors are watching us.

963
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:09,160
I have to put up an act.

964
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,599
Look at you.

965
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,859
You don't go out for drinks and work late every day.

966
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:17,232
You don't go out for drinks and work late every day.

967
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,519
When are you ever going to find a girlfriend?

968
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:24,660
I just realized something.

969
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,760
You've been cocky since you got married.

970
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,439
You're even concerned about my personal life.

971
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,260
At least, I'm wanted.

972
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,360
Not a backup anymore.

973
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,340
Keep it down.

974
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,060
Being handsome is useless.

975
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,900
You must talk sweetly.

976
00:49:09,736 --> 00:49:10,700
- What are you doing?
- Being sweet.

977
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,344
- What are you doing?
- Being sweet.

978
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:16,940
Don't be mad.

979
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,480
Have something sweet to be happy.

980
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,280
Let's go. I'll take you to dinner.

981
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,579
Mr. Xu is finally not overwhelmed by work?

982
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:26,700
Mr. Xu is finally not overwhelmed by work?

983
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,480
I'm leaving.

984
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,180
I wanted to see you before I leave.

985
00:49:39,499 --> 00:49:41,399
I want something fancy.

986
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:44,432
No problem.

987
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:51,280
My primary school classmate said I looked like lychee.

988
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,340
My primary school classmate said I looked like lychee.

989
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,880
Why?

990
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,480
Because I was short, chubby, and full of pimples.

991
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,719
Because I was short, chubby, and full of pimples.

992
00:49:57,719 --> 00:49:59,780
That's exactly like a lychee.

993
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,740
And you gave me a lychee today.

994
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,639
It's fine. Lychees are sweet.

995
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,880
How about this?

996
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,320
I'll change your WeChat nickname to Lychee.

997
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,279
- Do as you wish.
- Hold on tight.

998
00:50:11,279 --> 00:50:13,780
- Do as you wish.
- Hold on tight.

999
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,660
Xinzi really moved away.

1000
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,719
Xu Jiabai is quite something.

1001
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:33,000
Isn't it a bit dramatic?

1002
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,180
Two bedrooms became one bedroom.

1003
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,960
Just to be closer to work for your sister?

1004
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,499
But it's a serious matter.

1005
00:50:40,499 --> 00:50:42,200
You're a lawyer, so you know. He bought it before getting married.

1006
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,000
You're a lawyer, so you know. He bought it before getting married.

1007
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,979
Even if she has the key,

1008
00:50:45,979 --> 00:50:48,000
the house has nothing to do with her.

1009
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,239
What's the point of making it so clear?

1010
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,500
What's the point of making it so clear?

1011
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,540
It's a relationship, not a business.

1012
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,880
It's a relationship, not a business.

1013
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,960
Anyway, love is all about giving without asking for rewards.

1014
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,420
Anyway, love is all about giving without asking for rewards.

1015
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,920
Anyway, love is all about giving without asking for rewards.

1016
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,780
You're right. Love is irrational.

1017
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,400
You're right. Love is irrational.

1018
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,440
But people are rational.

1019
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,760
Normal people do consider Marginal Benefit,

1020
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,840
Sunk Cost, giving, and payback.

1021
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,960
Sunk Cost, giving, and payback.

1022
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,400
A heated passion can be romantic,

1023
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,860
A heated passion can be romantic,

1024
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,979
but how is it sustainable?

1025
00:51:13,979 --> 00:51:15,460
You can't expect men to be decisive and thrive at work,

1026
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,060
You can't expect men to be decisive and thrive at work,

1027
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,820
You can't expect men to be decisive and thrive at work,

1028
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,360
meanwhile, despise their sanity and rationality.

1029
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,219
meanwhile, despise their sanity and rationality.

1030
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,619
You have no idea, huh?

1031
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:28,000
No matter how time changes, there's one thing

1032
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,880
No matter how time changes, there's one thing

1033
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,900
that makes women really thrilled.

1034
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,540
If there's a man who loves her with full passion until he loses himself,

1035
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,839
If there's a man who loves her with full passion until he loses himself,

1036
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:38,519
until he'd die for her, until he becomes a fool,

1037
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:40,400
until he'd die for her, until he becomes a fool,

1038
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,519
then that woman would be thrilled, you know?

1039
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,399
But my experience tells me that a guy who ends up a fool in a relationship

1040
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:50,980
But my experience tells me that a guy who ends up a fool in a relationship

1041
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,740
But my experience tells me that a guy who ends up a fool in a relationship

1042
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,000
can't be any smarter in his workplace.

1043
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,479
can't be any smarter in his workplace.

1044
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,340
No wonder you've been single for three years.

1045
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,779
And you? How long?

1046
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,459
I've been single since my graduation. Why?

1047
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,560
You had an unforgettable relationship?

1048
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,800
Not exactly unforgettable.

1049
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,159
Actually, we weren't even together.

1050
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:20,080
I was the one who secretly loved him for ten years.

1051
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,259
I was the one who secretly loved him for ten years.

1052
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:27,860
Ten years?

1053
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,119
Let me put it this way. There are two types of single girls around my age.

1054
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,520
Let me put it this way. There are two types of single girls around my age.

1055
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,679
Let me put it this way. There are two types of single girls around my age.

1056
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:34,340
Let me put it this way. There are two types of single girls around my age.

1057
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,599
Type one.

1058
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,599
The innocent ones with unrealistic hopes for love.

1059
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,019
The innocent ones with unrealistic hopes for love.

1060
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:43,400
Type two. The sober ones.

1061
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,780
They know very well that most men in this world are not so trustworthy.

1062
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,880
They know very well that most men in this world are not so trustworthy.

1063
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,960
They know very well that most men in this world are not so trustworthy.

1064
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,839
They know very well that most men in this world are not so trustworthy.

1065
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,599
Unfortunately, because of him, I became the latter.

1066
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:51,719
Unfortunately, because of him, I became the latter.

1067
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:53,880
Unfortunately, because of him, I became the latter.

1068
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,832
But I don't blame him.

1069
00:52:57,159 --> 00:52:59,699
He really offered me a lot.

1070
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:01,040
After all, back then, I learned about the world

1071
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,139
After all, back then, I learned about the world

1072
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:05,480
basically through him.

1073
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,899
You fell in love in your teenage years.

1074
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:13,299
Is there something memorable?

1075
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,160
His name was Cheng Ke.

1076
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,599
He was a top-A student who was older in our neighborhood.

1077
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:20,260
He was a top-A student who was older in our neighborhood.

1078
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,500
- When I was in high school, he'd tutor me in the summer.
- Thanks.

1079
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,800
- When I was in high school, he'd tutor me in the summer.
- Thanks.

1080
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,299
- When I was in high school, he'd tutor me in the summer.
- Thanks.

1081
00:53:25,299 --> 00:53:26,419
Mr. Cheng, your place smells like a forest.

1082
00:53:26,419 --> 00:53:28,320
Mr. Cheng, your place smells like a forest.

1083
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,156
It's really nice.

1084
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,079
It's the smell of amber and pine.

1085
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,680
It's indeed like a forest.

1086
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,719
I thought only girls would use perfume.

1087
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:39,119
I thought only girls would use perfume.

1088
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,960
Of course not.

1089
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,800
The sense of smell is the most unique among all senses.

1090
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,700
The sense of smell is the most unique among all senses.

1091
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,199
Even if many years have passed,

1092
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,200
a familiar smell can easily drag you to the memory of the old days.

1093
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,920
a familiar smell can easily drag you to the memory of the old days.

1094
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,939
a familiar smell can easily drag you to the memory of the old days.

1095
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:56,080
You? What smell do you like?

1096
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,079
I like the smell of freshly cut oranges.

1097
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:03,740
I like the smell of freshly cut oranges.

1098
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,340
It's a bit sour and very refreshing.

1099
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:10,559
It suits you well.

1100
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,032
Sit.

1101
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,360
Not bad, Tang Ying.

1102
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,179
All correct again.

1103
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:25,519
All right.

1104
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:26,840
Keep it up.

1105
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,172
Here.

1106
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,140
Mr. Cheng, what movie is that?

1107
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:35,660
The Sun Also Rises. Directed by Jiang Wen.

1108
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,060
Ever watched it?

1109
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,019
Can I join you?

1110
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:41,652
Of course.

1111
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,419
Mr. Cheng.

1112
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:02,960
You woke up?

1113
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,180
He was the most excellent man I knew.

1114
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,639
He always brought me something fresh beyond daily life.

1115
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:10,539
He always brought me something fresh beyond daily life.

1116
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,879
Later, I realized that

1117
00:56:13,879 --> 00:56:15,880
even if a guy occasionally shows concern,

1118
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,180
it doesn't mean that he's into you.

1119
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,339
it doesn't mean that he's into you.

1120
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,239
Even if he holds my head for a year,

1121
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:23,319
Even if he holds my head for a year,

1122
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:24,520
it doesn't mean that he's into me.

1123
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,299
it doesn't mean that he's into me.

1124
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:30,720
What happened next?

1125
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,559
I gathered my courage and confessed.

1126
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,480
I gathered my courage and confessed.

1127
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,600
He rejected me.

1128
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,000
Then I swore to myself that I'd never enter an uncontrollable relationship

1129
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,680
Then I swore to myself that I'd never enter an uncontrollable relationship

1130
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,119
Then I swore to myself that I'd never enter an uncontrollable relationship

1131
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:43,299
nor become the fool

1132
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,140
nor become the fool

1133
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:48,919
who overestimated her charm in love.

1134
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,719
Now I know why you haven't dated anyone for so long.

1135
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:55,559
Now I know why you haven't dated anyone for so long.

1136
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:58,220
You refuse to yield to the pursuit

1137
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,679
and don't wish to get stuck in an uncontrollable relationship.

1138
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:02,839
and don't wish to get stuck in an uncontrollable relationship.

1139
00:57:02,839 --> 00:57:06,019
You don't like your pursuers.

1140
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:07,679
But you dare not love someone better.

1141
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:09,079
But you dare not love someone better.

1142
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:11,239
So tormented.

1143
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:14,499
You're caught in the middle. What will you do?

1144
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,780
You're right. I get it.

1145
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,240
I should find a rich and cool old man.

1146
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,319
I should find a rich and cool old man.

1147
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:29,639
He's going to be old. So I won't really be in love.

1148
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:31,560
He's going to be old. So I won't really be in love.

1149
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,080
But he's rich and cool,

1150
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,780
But he's rich and cool,

1151
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,700
so I can't turn him down.

1152
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,499
I'll get by with him.

1153
00:57:38,499 --> 00:57:40,380
When he finally passes away,

1154
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,760
I'll inherit all his fortune and enjoy my life in his villa.

1155
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,960
I'll inherit all his fortune and enjoy my life in his villa.

1156
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,120
I'll inherit all his fortune and enjoy my life in his villa.

1157
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:49,388
Good idea.

1158
00:57:50,419 --> 00:57:51,960
But if you find

1159
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,579
such an old man,

1160
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:56,340
then that man you mentioned

1161
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,599
may end up being the only one you've ever loved.

1162
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,699
may end up being the only one you've ever loved.

1163
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,259
Are you jealous?

1164
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:06,760
Does it matter?

1165
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,480
Everyone prefers new clothes and old lovers.

1166
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,800
After all, you're an independent woman in the prime of youth.

1167
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,240
After all, you're an independent woman in the prime of youth.

1168
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,519
It's normal for you to give off your damned charm.

1169
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:16,619
It's normal for you to give off your damned charm.

1170
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,839
But if that man comes back and asks

1171
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,540
to be with you one day,

1172
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:27,660
you should hold onto your bottom line.

1173
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,056
Are you jealous?

1174
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,299
I've never been so deeply loved by a girl.

1175
00:58:40,299 --> 00:58:44,160
I've never been so deeply loved by a girl.

1176
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,239
I'm not jealous. I'm super jealous.

1177
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:56,880
Tang Ying, you're not looking for someone out of your league.

1178
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,540
Tang Ying, you're not looking for someone out of your league.

1179
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,980
You're waiting..

1180
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,580
for a worthy rivalry.

1181
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,839
For example…

1182
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,790
[The Sweetest Peach in the World]

1183
00:59:30,979 --> 00:59:33,019
How sweet can it be?

1184
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:34,959
If I tell you that...

1185
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,679
it's a fruit dealer, will you believe me?

1186
00:59:42,139 --> 00:59:45,619
Lychee. Peach.

1187
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,760
Mr. Xu, it occurs to me that

1188
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,800
you really love to classify girls as fruits to remember them.

1189
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,079
you really love to classify girls as fruits to remember them.

1190
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:58,780
Waiter, the bill.

1191
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:07,248
Dinner's on me.

1192
01:00:08,139 --> 01:00:10,920
By the way, if you want to fish for girls,

1193
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,280
By the way, if you want to fish for girls,

1194
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,099
at least remember the names of the targets.

1195
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:19,500
at least remember the names of the targets.

1196
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,139
