00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,120
Let me take her back first.

182
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,500
I think she may throw up.

183
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:11,780
H-How about this?

184
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,860
- Let's take her back together.
- No need.

185
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,400
We live close by.

186
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,759
No, no. No need. It won't be nice if she throws up in your car.

187
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,920
I can take her home.

188
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,139
Don't worry. We got this.

189
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:23,440
Don't worry.

190
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,500
Don't worry. We got this.

191
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,660
T-Tang Ying—

192
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,260
I'm experienced. Don't worry.

193
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,200
Hang out with your friends.

194
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,140
You're really something.

195
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,500
Why did you flirt with him if you don't like him?

196
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,180
I thought I could like him.

197
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,660
But then I realized that I really couldn't.

198
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,619
Why not? Isn't he nice?

199
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:44,020
He's not cheesy. He's polite. And single.

200
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,440
A total gentleman.

201
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,340
I don't know.

202
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,116
I just…

203
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:51,900
I just changed my mind.

204
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,580
So fickle.

205
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,192
Get in the car.

206
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,659
- See you around. Bye.
- Bye.

207
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,180
Why are you here?

208
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,219
To remind you of me.

209
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,480
You're the one who left me there and disappeared for a week.

210
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,204
I did it on purpose.

211
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:53,200
I was afraid that you wouldn't miss me.

212
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,344
You had drinks?

213
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:02,740
I drank so much.

214
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,120
So happy.

215
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:11,220
But rest assured. This time, I'm not falling for your tricks.

216
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,799
Because I don't miss you that much.

217
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,380
It's okay. I have a plan B.

218
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,200
What's your plan B?

219
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,200
♫ ...recognizing you ♫

220
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,520
♫ You tore it out of me ♫

221
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,130
♫ A house full of unbelief ♫

222
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,560
It smells too much.

223
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,719
It's pricey.

224
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:38,668
Don't you want to taste it?

225
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,390
♫ She suffered enough ♫

226
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,760
♫ Normally, I want to walk away ♫

227
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:56,370
♫ And as you can tell, I can see love in these eyes... ♫

228
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,500
You kissed me.

229
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:02,700
So, the friendship ring doesn't work anymore.

230
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,616
I'm taking it.

231
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,419
You're leaving?

232
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:09,640
Just like that?

233
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,200
You scumbag.

234
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,140
Wipe your mouth.

235
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,420
No way.

236
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,820
I won't even wash my face.

237
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,470
♫ ...lights dancing over the moon ♫

238
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,799
What? He appeared out of nowhere, kissed you, and ran away?

239
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,239
I'm furious.

240
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:32,720
Don't be mad. It's just a man.

241
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:37,399
Why aren't you wearing a jacket?

242
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,060
Give me a break.

243
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,799
I only get to dress up when Xu Jiabai's away.

244
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,080
I only get to dress up when Xu Jiabai's away.

245
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,139
You have no idea how conservative he is.

246
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:46,399
Whenever I wear something more revealing

247
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:48,000
and get eyed by someone,

248
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,139
he'd stare at that guy.

249
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:51,540
So petty.

250
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,540
Are you really complaining about it

251
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,160
or are you bragging about it?

252
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,240
I really miss my shorts and skirts.

253
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,040
I really miss my shorts and skirts.

254
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,700
We dress up to please ourselves.

255
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,400
But I dare not wear those because he may be upset.

256
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,039
But I dare not wear those because he may be upset.

257
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,400
Why don't you fight for your right to please yourself?

258
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,499
Why don't you fight for your right to please yourself?

259
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,960
Never mind.

260
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,519
A relationship is all about

261
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,640
accommodating each other.

262
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,820
He's been so nice to me.

263
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,020
I'll just play along and let him get his way.

264
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,619
Seriously,

265
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:22,839
you've grown so mature

266
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:25,659
in this relationship.

267
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,279
Yeah.

268
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,519
I used to think that

269
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,060
my boyfriend must be super nice to me.

270
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,020
my boyfriend must be super nice to me.

271
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,240
But now that I have such a sweet boyfriend,

272
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,659
But now that I have such a sweet boyfriend,

273
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:37,719
something doesn't feel right.

274
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:40,340
Are you saying that

275
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,360
Xu Jiabai is not so attractive to you?

276
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,739
Xu Jiabai is not so attractive to you?

277
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,120
Let me put it this way.

278
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,720
Let's say your favorite male actor

279
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,179
serves you wholeheartedly

280
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:54,179
and remains absolutely obedient to you,

281
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,680
would you still find him charming?

282
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,179
I guess not.

283
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:01,240
You can't be attractive if you act inferior.

284
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,820
You can't be attractive if you act inferior.

285
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,540
Even if he's rich and handsome,

286
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,620
it's boring if he's just a simp.

287
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,599
it's boring if he's just a simp.

288
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,639
Since you've thought it through,

289
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:14,699
do you have any plans?

290
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:16,699
Not really.

291
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:18,039
It's that my relationship is different from what I thought.

292
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,760
It's that my relationship is different from what I thought.

293
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,600
It's that my relationship is different from what I thought.

294
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,599
But reality is always different from fantasies.

295
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,599
But reality is always different from fantasies.

296
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:27,320
And he's really nice to me.

297
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,159
Well, many guys may flirt with you.

298
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,580
Well, many guys may flirt with you.

299
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,960
But very few are truly nice to you.

300
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,100
But very few are truly nice to you.

301
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,000
How's it going with that slightly cheesy leader?

302
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,340
How's it going with that slightly cheesy leader?

303
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,759
Forget about him.

304
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,040
It's all talk.

305
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,820
He pursues women with schemes

306
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,900
just like—

307
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,760
I knew you'd say Xu Ziquan.

308
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:53,000
Speaking of which, how was it?

309
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,900
Speaking of which, how was it?

310
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,636
How was what?

311
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,279
The kiss.

312
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,499
What are you talking about?

313
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,100
It was great. Soft lips.

314
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,179
Tough heart.

315
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,020
But seriously, he's quite innovative.

316
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,440
If you can't solve something with a kiss,

317
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,140
try with more kisses.

318
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,739
This is his trick.

319
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,060
He just wants to make me wait and wonder

320
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,079
He just wants to make me wait and wonder

321
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,580
so that I keep thinking about him.

322
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,659
Once I'm fully hooked,

323
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,760
I can't break free from him.

324
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,039
I can't break free from him.

325
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:44,719
Sis,

326
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:47,339
I think Xu Ziquan is

327
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:49,640
just a flirt and not a lover.

328
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,340
It will be hard to make him get serious.

329
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,780
It will be hard to make him get serious.

330
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,979
But it's actually easy to deal with him

331
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:57,100
as long as you don't get serious.

332
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,939
Flirt back if he flirts with you.

333
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:01,140
Keep it well in line.

334
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,140
What's with that top?

335
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,759
Baby, why didn't you tell me you'd be home early?

336
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,419
Baby, why didn't you tell me you'd be home early?

337
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:42,599
I'm asking you.

338
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,920
We haven't met for days. Why aren't you hugging me?

339
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,000
We haven't met for days. Why aren't you hugging me?

340
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,960
You wouldn't let me wear these.

341
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,360
So I have to wear them when you're away.

342
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,400
I still wore long pants.

343
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,780
Who did you go out with?

344
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,379
- My sister.
- Your sister?

345
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:05,020
Why would I lie to you?

346
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,359
Baby, what's wrong?

347
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,080
I skipped work and came back in advance.

348
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,119
I skipped work and came back in advance.

349
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,800
Why?

350
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,160
I had a nightmare that

351
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,999
you were with someone else.

352
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:21,680
I couldn't even sleep.

353
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,740
So I asked for a day off and came home

354
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,300
just to see you like this.

355
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,400
It's still cold here. What if you get a cold?

356
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,419
It's still cold here. What if you get a cold?

357
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,179
What about your work?

358
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:34,519
Won't your boss scold you?

359
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,680
What's more important than you?

360
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,100
Come on, stop imagining things. Okay?

361
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,939
You must be hungry. I'll make some noodles.

362
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,956
Okay.

363
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:57,572
Don't be mad.

364
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,799
Baby, you got a message.

365
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,959
Baby, my hands are wet.

366
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:12,819
Check it for me.

367
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:13,319
- The password is 51—
- Don't tell me.

368
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,119
- The password is 51—
- Don't tell me.

369
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,580
Check it when you're done.

370
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,780
I'll leave your phone here.

371
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,468
Why?

372
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,300
I think even a couple needs some privacy.

373
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,540
I think even a couple needs some privacy.

374
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,179
I can't cross the line.

375
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:30,839
If you tell me the password, I'll be curious.

376
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,200
If you tell me the password, I'll be curious.

377
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,500
Curiosity kills the cat.

378
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,340
So it's better not to know the password.

379
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,648
Right?

380
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,800
♫ I'll give you the light of the moon ♫

381
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,870
♫ and a ship to sail across the ocean ♫

382
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,760
♫ Come join me soon, I'll be waiting, waiting ♫

383
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,900
♫ But don't make me wait too long ♫

384
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,279
Xinzi is right.

385
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,039
Xu Ziquan is only a flirt

386
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,200
and not a lover.

387
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,700
It's been a week

388
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,500
and he hasn't contacted me at all.

389
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,800
Staying defensive in a relationship

390
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,179
Staying defensive in a relationship

391
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:15,400
only delays the failure.

392
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,030
I want to take the initiative and strike.

393
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,370
♫ And that's just a drop in the bucket, my love ♫

394
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:26,260
♫ I'll give you everything ♫

395
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,580
♫ I'll give you peace ♫

396
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,780
♫ I’ll clear your mind ♫

397
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,520
♫ Come take your asylum, I won't leave you behind ♫

398
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,390
♫ I’ll edge you past dangers and strangers ♫

399
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,260
♫ And bring you every treasure I can possibly find ♫

400
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,640
♫ And I'll keep you safe from time ♫

401
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,890
♫ I'll make it turn on a dime ♫

402
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,620
♫ The tears of yesterday ♫

403
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,310
♫ Will wash tomorrows clouds away ♫

404
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,599
I can't sleep, thinking about you. What do I do?

405
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,780
I can't sleep, thinking about you. What do I do?

406
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,239
Me too.

407
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:05,640
I can't sleep, thinking about you.

408
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,110
I love you.

409
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:40,190
♫ Together we will chase dreams into the sky ♫

410
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,920
♫ With love as our guide, we'll soar and fly ♫

411
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,320
Really?

412
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:53,208
No.

413
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,340
So was it real that you couldn't sleep,

414
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,260
thinking about me?

415
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,040
No.

416
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,519
I fell asleep around midnight

417
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,260
and set an alarm for 3:27 a.m.

418
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,519
I slept really well.

419
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,180
I had a big glass of milk before bed,

420
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,720
watched many videos of muscled guys, and liked all of them.

421
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,000
watched many videos of muscled guys, and liked all of them.

422
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,839
What about you?

423
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,319
You also said you couldn't sleep.

424
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,320
Was it real?

425
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,440
I'm not lame enough to set an alarm just for this.

426
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
I'm not lame enough to set an alarm just for this.

427
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,099
I'm not lame enough to set an alarm just for this.

428
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:34,259
I stayed up because I was playing games.

429
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,428
But...

430
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,540
I did miss you.

431
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,380
That wasn't a lie.

432
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,328
Go to bed.

433
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,319
Tang Ying, I dreamed about you.

434
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,240
- I got lost and wandered in the woods for a long time.
- Nutjob.

435
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,340
- I got lost and wandered in the woods for a long time.
- Nutjob.

436
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,699
Finally, I saw a wooden cabin with a light on.

437
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:51,400
You were waiting for me inside.

438
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,179
Trying to lure me again, huh?

439
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,079
- Hello?
- You woke up?

440
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,519
Any plans this afternoon?

441
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,859
- Why?
- Want to come to my place?

442
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:26,519
Why?

443
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,139
For a movie. It's French.

444
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:29,700
For a movie. It's French.

445
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,260
After that, we can get a hotpot takeout and eat at home.

446
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,160
After that, we can get a hotpot takeout and eat at home.

447
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,439
After that, we can get a hotpot takeout and eat at home.

448
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:34,719
After that, we can get a hotpot takeout and eat at home.

449
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,140
No, thanks.

450
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,180
It's almost summer.

451
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,020
Hotpot? It's too hot.

452
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,839
I'm not going there.

453
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,780
We can put the AC on.

454
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,340
We'll put it at 16 degrees.

455
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,559
It will be like autumn.

456
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,080
It's the lazy weekend.

457
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,319
I just want to stay in and not go anywhere.

458
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,440
I just want to stay in and not go anywhere.

459
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,120
It's so nice in bed.

460
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,519
Maybe you can stay in bed for another hour.

461
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,859
Maybe you can stay in bed for another hour.

462
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:57,160
I'll get you a ride.

463
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,820
You can get changed once it's there.

464
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,540
Come over and be lazy here.

465
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,020
Why do I have to go there?

466
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,039
Because I want to see you.

467
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,200
Don't you want to see me?

468
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,580
Why do I go over to you?

469
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,680
Fine, stay and wait for me. I'll be right there.

470
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,960
Fine, stay and wait for me. I'll be right there.

471
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,079
No, no need.

472
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,580
I was joking.

473
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,519
Wait. I want spam, duck blood, duck intestine, pig brain,

474
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,759
Wait. I want spam, duck blood, duck intestine, pig brain,

475
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:24,120
large intestine, and deep-fried pork belly.

476
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,460
Plain soup. Medium spice.

477
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,319
Get them ready.

478
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,920
Should I change shoes?

479
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,192
Get those.

480
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,560
Okay.

481
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,632
Let's go.

482
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,060
Sit.

483
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,040
What are we doing?

484
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,780
Watching a movie.

485
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,779
Watching a movie?

486
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,196
Yeah.

487
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,980
Didn't someone say that

488
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,440
couples going to the cinema for a date

489
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,440
couples going to the cinema for a date

490
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,480
aren't really there for the movie, but for the darkness?

491
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,219
aren't really there for the movie, but for the darkness?

492
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,920
So is this a date?

493
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,708
Of course.

494
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:01,639
Otherwise, why would I bring you home?

495
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,740
Otherwise, why would I bring you home?

496
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,019
Well, where's the bathroom?

497
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:28,820
It's in the bedroom on the left.

498
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,580
Hey, there.

499
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,960
You paused it for me?

500
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,120
Are you so serious about movies?

501
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,879
Of course.

502
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:06,759
Aren't we supposed to be immersed?

503
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:08,000
And it's such a happy thing to watch movies with someone we like.

504
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,200
And it's such a happy thing to watch movies with someone we like.

505
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,260
And it's such a happy thing to watch movies with someone we like.

506
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,199
I didn't know you'd be such an artistic person.

507
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:23,000
I didn't know you'd be such an artistic person.

508
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,540
Not exactly.

509
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,039
I do sometimes read romance novels.

510
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,200
Then you're not artistic.

511
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,820
You have a girl's heart.

512
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,480
It’s not bad to have a girlish heart.

513
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,319
I get to know what the girls are thinking.

514
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:37,519
I get to know what the girls are thinking.

515
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,019
Whatever you say. I am a girl.

516
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:41,980
That's what I'm saying.

517
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,364
It's ready.

518
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:49,780
Are you okay? It's hot. Touch the earlobe.

519
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:54,152
You…

520
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:00,800
♫ With love as our guide we'll soar and fly ♫

521
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,160

522
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,130

524
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,320
Let me get this.

525
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,939
Hello, Mr. Ma.

526
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,139
Yeah, go ahead, please.

527
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,159
All right, please send me the address via WeChat.

528
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,979
All right, please send me the address via WeChat.

529
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:44,580
What time?

530
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,439
Actually, I'm…

531
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,672
All right.

532
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:56,416
Okay.

533
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,116
Your client?

534
00:38:12,939 --> 00:38:13,699
I may not be able to have food with you.

535
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:17,460
I may not be able to have food with you.

536
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,432
I have to go.

537
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,960
It's okay. Work comes first.

538
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,939
We can do this another time.

539
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,060
He may be a client,

540
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,619
but it may not be business.

541
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:36,240
Probably not. Actually…

542
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,060
If you wanted to or if you could turn him down, you would have done so.

543
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,359
If you wanted to or if you could turn him down, you would have done so.

544
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,619
If you wanted to or if you could turn him down, you would have done so.

545
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,640
You look reluctant to go, so I guess it's not easy to say no.

546
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,219
You look reluctant to go, so I guess it's not easy to say no.

547
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:48,660
Right?

548
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,020
Tang Ying.

549
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,916
Your shoes.

550
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,579
Is it Ma Qiyuan?

551
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:20,960
Is it Ma Qiyuan?

552
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,739
So I'm leaving.

553
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:30,364
Text me.

554
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,519
Mr. Ma.

555
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,880
Tang Ying, come and sit.

556
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,000
I hope I didn't disturb your work schedule.

557
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,824
Not at all.

558
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,599
It's not the two of us? Are you expecting someone?

559
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,320
It's not the two of us? Are you expecting someone?

560
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,380
Yeah, a friend is coming.

561
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,339
He said he'd bring a lady.

562
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,540
I was like, "Perfect."

563
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,780
I guess you haven't come here before. So I called you.

564
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,179
I guess you haven't come here before. So I called you.

565
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,960
Is he coming with his wife?

566
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,239
No, she's abroad.

567
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,760
Mr. Ma, long time no see.

568
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,860
Mr. Ma, long time no see.

569
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,460
Mr. Li, I missed you so much.

570
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,940
Me too.

571
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:15,640
You're trying an intellectual style?

572
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:17,980
Tang Ying, let me introduce him.

573
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,599
This is Mr. Li, a respectable friend of mine.

574
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:21,900
I'm Li.

575
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,319
This is Tang Ying from Junheng.

576
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,060
- Hello.
- Hello.

577
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,560
This is Michelle.

578
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,079
She's a web celebrity with hundreds of thousands of followers.

579
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:31,180
She's a web celebrity with hundreds of thousands of followers.

580
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,860
Mr. Ma, you're so mean.

581
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,800
You make fun of me every time we meet.

582
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,200
- What's your account ID? I can follow you.
- Of course.

583
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,580
- What's your account ID? I can follow you.
- Of course.

584
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,480
- What's your account ID? I can follow you.
- Of course.

585
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,140
- Come on, let's sit down.
- Let's sit down.

586
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,199
Hello, handsome. Want to have dinner?

587
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:58,199
What would you like?

588
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,880
Hotpot. It's getting on me.

589
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,000
Why aren't you eating?

590
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,480
I'm not hungry.

591
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,419
Then, why did you come for a hotpot?

592
00:42:15,419 --> 00:42:17,339
You love me so much?

593
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:18,800
I missed you so much. You're finally back in Beijing.

594
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,359
I missed you so much. You're finally back in Beijing.

595
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:22,600
Be serious.

596
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:26,660
You haven't shown up for so long.

597
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,979
I thought you were with someone.

598
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,200
Who does that nowadays?

599
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,480
The Beijing hotpot is the best.

600
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:38,320
You're on your phone? What's wrong with you?

601
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,660
You're on your phone? What's wrong with you?

602
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,619
Don't drink alone. Come on. Cheers.

603
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:43,500
Don't drink alone. Come on. Cheers.

604
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,000
Wait. I have a question for you.

605
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,399
Someone ditched you?

606
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:50,060
That's why you asked me out?

607
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,719
You're quite something.

608
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:53,540
I'm very popular.

609
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,279
Nobody ditches me. Okay?

610
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:58,159
Tell me.

611
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,320
If you're having dinner with a guy

612
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,079
and he burns his finger,

613
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:05,940
you tell him to touch the earlobe

614
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,400
but he touches yours, what would you think?

615
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,372
but he touches yours, what would you think?

616
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,220
He's into me.

617
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,399
He's definitely into me.

618
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,540
What do you think?

619
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,719
I-If he touches me and I don't avoid it,

620
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:23,880
I-If he touches me and I don't avoid it,

621
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:26,640
then I'm also into him.

622
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,048
Really?

623
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:32,960
But you leave for work

624
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,180
and don't even reply to his messages.

625
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,632
Why?

626
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,220
Xu Ziquan, what happened to you?

627
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,780
You're so not cool right now, you know?

628
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:47,080
No way.

629
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,000
Come on.

630
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,500
- We haven't—
- It's been so long.

631
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,179
- Yeah.
- It's been so long.

632
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:54,659
What do you do?

633
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:57,000
- I'm a lawyer.
- A lawyer? Impressive.

634
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,400
- I'm thinking—
- Yeah.

635
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,960
Your boyfriend dares not fight you, huh?

636
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:02,679
Lawyers don't really win in those fights with their partners.

637
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:03,920
Lawyers don't really win in those fights with their partners.

638
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,359
Lawyers don't really win in those fights with their partners.

639
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,860
We may be relatively logical,

640
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,159
but fighting is not about logic. Right?

641
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:11,879
but fighting is not about logic. Right?

642
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:13,460
Great.

643
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,500
Actually, my family once had family lawyers.

644
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,380
Actually, my family once had family lawyers.

645
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,500
But then I severed my ties with my parents

646
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,500
But then I severed my ties with my parents

647
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,459
and had to live on my own.

648
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,979
So I started working like a peasant.

649
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,440
Family lawyers? That's impressive.

650
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,279
Family lawyers? That's impressive.

651
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:30,159
We're actually the last generation of nobles in China.

652
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:32,079
We're actually the last generation of nobles in China.

653
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:41,920
How do you like their soup here?

654
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,639
How do you like their soup here?

655
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:46,800
Let me try it.

656
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,696
A real gourmet.

657
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,640
The refreshing taste

658
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,039
and the tender texture match perfectly.

659
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:54,639
and the tender texture match perfectly.

660
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:56,600
The soup has layered tastes,

661
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,640
which reminds me of Zhuge Liang's Letter Cautioning Son.

662
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,500
which reminds me of Zhuge Liang's Letter Cautioning Son.

663
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,639
Keep a peaceful mind. Adopt a frugal living.

664
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:03,380
Keep a peaceful mind. Adopt a frugal living.

665
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,500
Only freedom from vanity shows one's lofty goal.

666
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,500
Only peace of mind helps achieve something lasting.

667
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,299
That's what I feel about this dish.

668
00:45:10,299 --> 00:45:12,560
Well said.

669
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,308
Great comment.

670
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,040
Full of content.

671
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,200
This is my job.

672
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,360
There's so much competition among self-media.

673
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,940
There's so much competition among self-media.

674
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,719
You have to produce something different, interesting, and quirky to attract attention.

675
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:28,079
You have to produce something different, interesting, and quirky to attract attention.

676
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:31,420
But wouldn't people find it too pretentious?

677
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,779
But wouldn't people find it too pretentious?

678
00:45:33,779 --> 00:45:36,259
Do they even accept it today?

679
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:37,180
Tell you what. Nowadays, everyone hates pretentious people.

680
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,360
Tell you what. Nowadays, everyone hates pretentious people.

681
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,940
Tell you what. Nowadays, everyone hates pretentious people.

682
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,480
But they're all pretentious, too.

683
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,980
What's the point of having social media?

684
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,239
It's meant for everyone to be openly pretentious.

685
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:49,099
It's meant for everyone to be openly pretentious.

686
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:52,320
Don't tell me that you're never pretentious.

687
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,648
- Honey, you're full of work.
- Here.

688
00:45:55,648 --> 00:45:56,260
- Honey, you're full of work.
- Here.

689
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,430
You're ignoring me.

690
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:02,179
Let's drink. You don't even pay attention to me.

691
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:04,104
Cheers, Tang Ying.

692
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:11,039
Most of my followers are just common people.

693
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:13,079
Most of my followers are just common people.

694
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:14,840
Isn't it nice to show them the world and a different life?

695
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,199
Isn't it nice to show them the world and a different life?

696
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:17,740
Isn't it nice to show them the world and a different life?

697
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,679
People who seek a quality life like me are also curious

698
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:21,040
People who seek a quality life like me are also curious

699
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,199
about the common people's livelihood nowadays.

700
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:23,780
about the common people's livelihood nowadays.

701
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,140
I heard that most people, I mean the white collars,

702
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,220
I heard that most people, I mean the white collars,

703
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,679
have to commute by the subway. They don't even have cars.

704
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:30,180
have to commute by the subway. They don't even have cars.

705
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,399
Many people haven't even been abroad or taken a plane.

706
00:46:31,399 --> 00:46:32,800
Many people haven't even been abroad or taken a plane.

707
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,520
Many people haven't even been abroad or taken a plane.

708
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,739
Isn't that creepy?

709
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:40,860
The subway sounds fine to me.

710
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,259
It costs a few billions.

711
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,660
You haven't tried it? It's fine.

712
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,479
I'll show you next time.

713
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:58,780
Isn't Michelle fun?

714
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:01,540
Yeah.

715
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,659
She's quite fun.

716
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:05,620
That girl used to be a waitress in a diner.

717
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,580
That girl used to be a waitress in a diner.

718
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,039
She went with Mr. Li last year and learned a few things.

719
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:11,219
She went with Mr. Li last year and learned a few things.

720
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:13,839
Then she became really interesting.

721
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,000
So we often invite her out for entertainment

722
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,599
So we often invite her out for entertainment

723
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:19,280
when we have nothing better to do.

724
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:29,220
Mr. Ma, I don't really get it.

725
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:31,704
Well, why can't Mr. Li

726
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:33,340
Well, why can't Mr. Li

727
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,060
just live with his wife and stay loyal to their marriage?

728
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,440
just live with his wife and stay loyal to their marriage?

729
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,580
Why does he want a young girl with him?

730
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:44,860
There are a few needs spouses can't fulfill,

731
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,080
There are a few needs spouses can't fulfill,

732
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:51,800
especially for those who possess many things.

733
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,119
The more they have,

734
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,699
the fewer things there are to satisfy them.

735
00:47:54,699 --> 00:47:57,400
the fewer things there are to satisfy them.

736
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,280
That's why you need fresh young girls

737
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,020
That's why you need fresh young girls

738
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,259
to bring you excitement.

739
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,520
Have you heard of a story called Barn Burning?

740
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,300
Have you heard of a story called Barn Burning?

741
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,919
- It's about—
- I've read it.

742
00:48:18,919 --> 00:48:22,060
The male protagonist was a wealthy man who led a perfectly happy life,

743
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,159
The male protagonist was a wealthy man who led a perfectly happy life,

744
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:25,519
The male protagonist was a wealthy man who led a perfectly happy life,

745
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:28,880
but he kept burning the barns

746
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,819
to get rid of that loneliness and hollowness

747
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:33,319
to get rid of that loneliness and hollowness

748
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:35,960
just to seek inner peace.

749
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:39,560
Who would care about those abandoned barns?

750
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,739
Who would care about those abandoned barns?

751
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,020
Mr. Ma, you've been asking me out.

752
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,779
Mr. Ma, you've been asking me out.

753
00:48:58,779 --> 00:49:00,660
So I thought...

754
00:49:02,259 --> 00:49:03,480
you were into me.

755
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,280
Of course, I am.

756
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,580
And do you know what I like about you?

757
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,400
Not your looks or your qualifications,

758
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,819
but that fighting spirit,

759
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:15,640
that aspiration to seek upward mobility.

760
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,439
that aspiration to seek upward mobility.

761
00:49:19,439 --> 00:49:21,539
Just like Michelle?

762
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,700
You both are different in many ways.

763
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,400
You both are different in many ways.

764
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:47,159
Although Michelle curries favor with the rich and powerful,

765
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:50,640
Although Michelle curries favor with the rich and powerful,

766
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,819
I don't despise her.

767
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,380
Being subservient is much harder than working.

768
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,959
The former requires great devotion.

769
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:02,839
It's not just about youth and mental effort.

770
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:04,840
We're also talking about the soul

771
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,440
and integrity of a human being.

772
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,540
Not everyone can bear such a price.

773
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,499
They have to constantly lower their bottom line.

774
00:50:12,499 --> 00:50:15,640
They have to constantly lower their bottom line.

775
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,039
Only independent women are valuable.

776
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:20,159
Only independent women are valuable.

777
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:23,739
Those who wait for others

778
00:50:23,739 --> 00:50:25,640
to pay the bill with a flattering smile are useless barns.

779
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,920
to pay the bill with a flattering smile are useless barns.

780
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:32,339
You don't get to decide if a barn is useful.

781
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:35,139
You don't get to decide if a barn is useful.

782
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:36,599
The so-called useless barns refer to those young and poor girls

783
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:38,559
The so-called useless barns refer to those young and poor girls

784
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,920
who resort to their beauty as capital

785
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,379
to hang out with elites for upward mobility. Right?

786
00:50:42,379 --> 00:50:44,399
to hang out with elites for upward mobility. Right?

787
00:50:44,399 --> 00:50:46,000
You people are so weird.

788
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,419
On the one hand, you find them useless.

789
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,239
On the other hand, you just love showing them the world

790
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:51,419
On the other hand, you just love showing them the world

791
00:50:51,419 --> 00:50:52,360
and providing them with a better life.

792
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,160
and providing them with a better life.

793
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,179
And once they're fully accustomed to that lifestyle

794
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,280
and once they're eaten up by your capitalistic mindset, you'll get rid of them

795
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,599
and once they're eaten up by your capitalistic mindset, you'll get rid of them

796
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,780
and once they're eaten up by your capitalistic mindset, you'll get rid of them

797
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,519
to see them devastated and break down.

798
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,800
Because different girls break down in different ways.

799
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,900
Because different girls break down in different ways.

800
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,879
Because different girls break down in different ways.

801
00:51:07,879 --> 00:51:09,840
You just love tormenting the young girls by destroying their willpower.

802
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,039
You just love tormenting the young girls by destroying their willpower.

803
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:12,899
You just love tormenting the young girls by destroying their willpower.

804
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:14,000
Because you think it's the best barn to burn.

805
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,739
Because you think it's the best barn to burn.

806
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:17,960
But has it crossed your mind that when you toy with those girls,

807
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,720
But has it crossed your mind that when you toy with those girls,

808
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,079
they're simply seeing you as a sugar daddy?

809
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,840
they're simply seeing you as a sugar daddy?

810
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,724
Tang Ying?

811
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,880
Mr. Ma, I've been thinking about what you said.

812
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,900
Mr. Ma, I've been thinking about what you said.

813
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,560
You've got a point.

814
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:11,399
I think I know a girl who lives here.

815
00:52:11,399 --> 00:52:13,880
I think I know a girl who lives here.

816
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,099
Really? What a small world.

817
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:22,719
Good night. See you around.

818
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:25,460
All right, Mr. Ma. Goodbye.

Maybe I just want you.

827
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,030

I'm sorry I left.

843
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,239
I'll treat you to a hotpot.

844
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:25,304
You're home?

845
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,659
I just arrived.

846
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,280
So you had dinner?

847
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,360
So you had dinner?

848
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,160
Yeah.

849
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:38,512
You?

850
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,560
Are you home?

851
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,080
Of course not.

852
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,860
I asked someone else out for dinner

853
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,840
I asked someone else out for dinner

854
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,519
right after you left.

855
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:49,860
We had a hotpot.

856
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,059
It's a girl.

857
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:57,659
A pretty girl.

858
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,380
I almost forgot.

859
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,600
You have a thousand dates.

860
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,319
So next time, cherish the playboy.

861
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:10,179
So next time, cherish the playboy.

862
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,380
So did you enjoy the hotpot?

863
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:16,760
So did you enjoy the hotpot?

864
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:31,400
The tripe is tender. The duck blood is fresh.

865
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,359
I'll take you there.

866
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:34,639
But of course. If you ditch me again,

867
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:36,899
But of course. If you ditch me again,

868
00:56:36,899 --> 00:56:37,480
I'll have to ask another girl out.

869
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,560
I'll have to ask another girl out.

870
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,120
What's wrong?

871
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,379
You don't sound very happy.

872
00:56:43,379 --> 00:56:45,999
You don't sound very happy.

873
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:51,260
Yeah, it wasn't...

874
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,700
a great night for me.

875
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,000
But hearing that you're enjoying dinner with another girl,

876
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,420
But hearing that you're enjoying dinner with another girl,

877
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,779
I feel much better.

878
00:57:02,779 --> 00:57:05,180
And I'm happy for you.

879
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,159
Am I that important?

880
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:12,739
You're always important.

881
00:57:12,739 --> 00:57:14,700
Don't you know?

882
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,839
I don't believe you.

883
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,420
If I'm really so important, why did you ditch me today?

884
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:22,159
If I'm really so important, why did you ditch me today?

885
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,160
If you minded it so much,

886
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:31,579
why didn't you keep me there?

887
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:33,480
Why did you go out with another girl?

888
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,820
Why did you go out with another girl?

889
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,852
Tang Ying.

890
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,400
I… never urge people to stay.

891
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,839
I… never urge people to stay.

892
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,840
Ever since I was a kid,

893
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,539
I've never forced anything to happen.

894
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,520
Because I always believe that whatever belongs to you...

895
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,840
Because I always believe that whatever belongs to you...

896
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,239
will end up being yours.

897
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:00,980
Otherwise, there's no point in forcing it.

898
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,380
Otherwise, there's no point in forcing it.

899
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,679
I'm completely different.

900
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,220
I'm an ordinary-looking girl from an ordinary family.

901
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,800
I'm an ordinary-looking girl from an ordinary family.

902
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,960
Anything dazzling in my life is the result

903
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,079
Anything dazzling in my life is the result

904
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:15,619
Anything dazzling in my life is the result

905
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:18,320
of my relentless effort.

906
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,459
Not everyone is entitled to follow the flow.

907
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:23,280
Not everyone is entitled to follow the flow.

908
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,040
Most people work hard for their dreams.

909
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,460
Most people work hard for their dreams.

910
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:30,239
If I adopt your ideology of not forcing...

911
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:33,460
If I adopt your ideology of not forcing...

912
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,720
anything to happen, then I'm doomed.

913
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,280
anything to happen, then I'm doomed.

914
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,180
I will never...

915
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,040
give up even the slightest hope or the slimmest chance...

916
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,519
give up even the slightest hope or the slimmest chance...

917
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:46,600
give up even the slightest hope or the slimmest chance...

918
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,700
that comes my way.

919
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:57,580
So have you ever considered…

920
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:02,319
So have you ever considered…

921
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,459
forcing me a bit?

922
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:13,299
Let me put it this way, Xu Ziquan.

923
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,659
Have you ever considered urging me a bit?

924
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:18,559
Have you ever considered urging me a bit?

925
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:31,299
What a night.

926
00:59:31,299 --> 00:59:32,360
One disenchantment right after another.

927
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,780
One disenchantment right after another.

928
00:59:35,779 --> 00:59:37,739
The man you try to reach

929
00:59:37,739 --> 00:59:40,659
despises you from the bottom of his heart.

930
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:42,980
The man who makes you tempted

931
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,796
won't take one step further.
