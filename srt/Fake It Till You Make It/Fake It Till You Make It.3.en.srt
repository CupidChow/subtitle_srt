No need.

You spy on me all day long. And you cheated on me?

35
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:46,392
It's because I never feel secure around you.

36

You'll cheat on me one day.

But they had no profit, no sales.

146
00:08:14,938 --> 00:08:17,164
It was careless to try to be listed overseas.

Graduated from an elite university in 2007.

00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:26,143
Made it to senior management in a Fortune 500.

He has connections.

154
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:32,184
But he's from an ordinary family.

155
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:33,823
What's the point of having connections?

156
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:35,124
He didn't even work on IT. And meta-universe?

157
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:36,604
He didn't even work on IT. And meta-universe?

158
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:37,894
It's clearly a bluff. Let me see.

It's clearly a bluff. Let me see.

160
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,530
Why did Wanguo take an interest in them?

161
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,364
I see.

00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:47,324
Over 200 IP patents and trademarks.

164
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:54,004
That means they have a good user base.

165
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:55,903
But the DAU is not so great.

166
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:59,084
Wanguo is just rich and overbearing.

167
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:02,342
They want to take the lead in every sector.

168
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,743
Even if the whole thing will change,

169
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:07,290
they can't afford to fall behind.

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,554

171
00:09:14,824 --> 00:09:17,334

We can't make any mistakes with Walrus this time.

175

00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:04,804
We need to conduct due diligence as soon as possible.

182
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:09,022
Which one of you will take on the case?

183
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:23,674
Mr. Zheng, we have too many cases at hand.

184
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:26,503
Mr. Zheng, we have too many cases at hand.

185
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:28,410
And they're all major clients.

186
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,582
We can't be distracted.

187
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:33,423
Miss Wang? Will you take it?

188
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,130
Miss Wang? Will you take it?

189
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:40,282
All right, Mr. Zheng.

190
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:46,974
Okay, our HR just recruited two interns.

191
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:51,424
Okay, our HR just recruited two interns.

192
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:54,404
Who's going to train them?

193
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:56,604
Hello, I'm Chen Si.

194
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:58,242
I'm a graduate of ECUPL.

195
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,923
Please call me Tim.

196
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:01,783
Hello, I'm Lin Shuting.

197
00:11:01,783 --> 00:11:04,834
I'm honored to join you. Thank you.

198
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:09,183
We've gotten to know each other back at the training camp.

199
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,010
So, from now on, I hope we can get along as soon as possible.

200
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,784
So, from now on, I hope we can get along as soon as possible.

201
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:14,204
If you need a laborer to carry water, print files, sort out archives,

202
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:15,923
If you need a laborer to carry water, print files, sort out archives,

203
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:16,954
If you need a laborer to carry water, print files, sort out archives,

204
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:18,106
If you need a laborer to carry water, print files, sort out archives,

205
00:11:18,106 --> 00:11:19,623
or anything, you name it, I'll do it for you.

206
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:20,666
or anything, you name it, I'll do it for you.

207
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,110
Just give me a call.

208
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,644
Tim is quite interesting.

209
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:26,624
Tim, we're a team.

210
00:11:27,324 --> 00:11:30,302
- Maybe…
- Mr. Zheng, let me train them.

211
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:31,764
Guo Yu went to your team.

212
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:33,064
I need some hands. Let them join us.

213
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:34,803
I need some hands. Let them join us.

214
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:35,883
I have more cases and our clients are major companies.

215
00:11:35,883 --> 00:11:38,484
I have more cases and our clients are major companies.

216
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:39,543
It's rare for an intern to get such to get such great opportunities.

217
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:41,484
for an intern to get such great opportunities.

218
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:42,713
for an intern to get such great opportunities.

219
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:45,314
I think it's a win-win.

220
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:46,870
What do you say?

221
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:51,682
I thought we'd each get one intern.

222
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:55,664
I think Miss Han is right.

223
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:57,146
They accepted the training together during the internship.

224
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:59,962
They accepted the training together during the internship.

225
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:01,604
And they worked well with each other on the training subject.

226
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:04,954
And they worked well with each other on the training subject.

227
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:08,373
If we want them to unleash their full potential

228
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:12,284
and make greater contributions at work,

229
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:15,514
they should work together.

230
00:12:15,514 --> 00:12:18,074
Miss Han, please instruct them.

231
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:39,186
You've been there for ages.

232
00:12:39,186 --> 00:12:41,310
Are you really dressing up for work?

233
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,998
It's my day off.

234
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:46,023
The older guy asked me out.

235
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:46,803
He's leaving soon. So he wanted to meet with no further ado.

236
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:49,178
He's leaving soon. So he wanted to meet with no further ado.

237
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:50,330
Check it out.

238
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,883
Hot or sweet?

239
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:52,924
Which is better?

240
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:54,963
Look at you.

241
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:58,742
You're thriving in romance.

242
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:01,163
Well, you've been encouraging me.

243
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:03,130
Where are you going?

244
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,524
I don't know yet.

245
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:08,283
But he's coming to pick me up.

246
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:10,302
Look at you.

247
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:11,484
- He doesn't deserve your passion without a fancy car.
- Totally.

248
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:13,914
- He doesn't deserve your passion without a fancy car.
- Totally.

249
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,923
Should I find you an evening gown?

250
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:18,010
What if he lays a red carpet for you?

251
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,034
Do you have any?

252
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:21,570
Come on! Of course not.

253
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,844
You'll be overdressed.

254
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,658
It's too much.

255
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:27,738
So what should I wear?

256
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:29,306
Listen to me. Black dress. High heels.

257
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:30,586
Listen to me. Black dress. High heels.

258
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:32,478
Let your hair down.

259
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,466
Are you sure?

260
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:34,914
I'll put some makeup on you.

261
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,844
You'll be stunning.

262
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,622
Let's try.

263
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:39,774
Sit down. I got this.

264
00:13:39,774 --> 00:13:41,553
Let's find you a lipstick.

265
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:44,344
To match the black dress.

266
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:45,724
He's here.

267
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,554
It's okay. Hurry, lipstick.

268
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:48,690
It's okay. Hurry, lipstick.

269
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:51,754
Check this out.

270
00:13:51,754 --> 00:13:53,683
Let me try it on you.

271
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,060
♫ Keep on feelin' that way, keep on going on up when I with you  ♫

272
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,350
♫ Keep on going that way, into the lights, up into the light when I'm with you ♫

273
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,780
♫ Keep on feelin' that way, keep on going on up when I with you  ♫

274
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:26,470
♫ Keep on going that way, into the lights, up into the light when I'm with you ♫

275
00:14:35,303 --> 00:14:37,754
Hello, Mr. Zheng.

276
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:39,803
We've been conducting due diligence

277
00:14:39,803 --> 00:14:41,754
on Walrus day and night.

278
00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:43,584
Well, Tang.

279
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:44,890
Tell me how it went.

280
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,978
All right.

281
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:48,084
First, Walrus Technology had a dispute

282
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:49,594
over unfair competition.

283
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:51,944
According to the court's legal documents,

284
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:53,814
in July 2019, Walrus's ex-chairman Mr. Zhang

285
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:55,464
in July 2019, Walrus's ex-chairman Mr. Zhang made his employee search

286
00:14:55,464 --> 00:14:56,914
in July 2019, Walrus's ex-chairman Mr. Zhang made his employee search

287
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:57,984
for illegal content on his rival's platform to take them down but failed.

288
00:14:57,984 --> 00:15:01,124
for illegal content on his rival's platform to take them down but failed.

289
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:02,204
for illegal content on his rival's platform to take them down but failed.

290
00:15:02,204 --> 00:15:03,226
Then, Mr. Zhang registered an account

291
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:04,984
Then, Mr. Zhang registered an account

292
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:07,624
and posted illegal content on the platform.

293
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:08,666
He took screenshots and filed a complaint.

294
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,063
He took screenshots and filed a complaint.

295
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:12,366
The malicious report got the competitor

296
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:14,623
taken off the market for three months.

297
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,484
Is Walrus Technology done with the lawsuit?
- No.

298
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,103
Is Walrus Technology done with the lawsuit?
- No.

299
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:19,224
Right now, they're involved in another major risk.

300
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:21,423
Right now, they're involved in another major risk.

301
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,144
They're issuing a virtual currency.

302
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:24,564
You can think of it as an in-game currency.

303
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:26,624
You can think of it as an in-game currency.

304
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:28,866
Some people are taking advantage of the loopholes.

305
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:32,160
Virtual currencies aren't very regulated.

306
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,456
Yeah, you're totally right.

307
00:15:34,456 --> 00:15:36,472
A relative of mine was into that

308
00:15:36,472 --> 00:15:38,316
and even mortgaged his house.

309
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,446
So, Mr. Zheng, should we take on the case?

310
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:43,772
So, Mr. Zheng, should we take on the case?

311
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:46,106
Be thorough with the risk disclosure.

312
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:47,385
This case can be highly profitable.

313
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:49,464
This case can be highly profitable.

314
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:51,346
Okay, got it.

315
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:54,976
Risk comes along with profit.

316
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:56,336
Well, Tang.

317
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:59,425
Keep up the good work. Okay?

318
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,505
- Let's work on this.  - Sis.

319
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:02,628
- Let's work on this.
- Sis.

320
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,166
Okay, see you next time.

321
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:08,252
- I'm so annoyed.
- I was in a meeting.

322
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:11,156
What's wrong? Tell me what happened.

323
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:14,464
Guess what vehicle he came with?

324
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:15,420
What?

325
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,866
Shared bicycle.

326
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:22,336
You look different today.

327
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:24,446
You look different today.

328
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:25,927
You're gorgeous.

329
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:27,864
Thank you.

330
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:31,896
Are we taking the bike?

331
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:36,386
It's close by. I wanted to bike with you.

332
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:38,208
It's close by. I wanted to bike with you.

333
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,480
But it's not so easy with your dress.

334
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,164
Let's get a cab.

335
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,727
It was empty.

336
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,544
There's a bus station.

337
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:35,164
Shall we take the bus?

338
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:11,527
It was so awkward.

339
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:12,888
I stood on the bus with him for three stops in high heels.

340
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:15,187
I stood on the bus with him for three stops in high heels.

341
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:19,612
And he took me to a street-side lamb soup restaurant.

342
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,140
[Lamb Soup Restaurant]
[Order fine home cooking]

343
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:32,672
What would you like?

344
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:35,252
The lamb soup is amazing.

345
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:37,080
Well,

346
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:39,616
I rarely have lamb.

347
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:41,687
I think they stink.

348
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:45,592
Shall we go somewhere else?

349
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:49,408
It's okay. Let's eat since we're here.

350
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:50,788
It's okay. Let's eat since we're here.

351
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:53,592
So I'll get what I like.

352
00:18:58,067 --> 00:18:59,840
All right, excuse me.

353
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,016
Be careful. It's burning.

354
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:07,424
- Here.
- Thanks.

355
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:16,920
I love adding pepper to the lamb soup.

356
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,364
I love adding pepper to the lamb soup.

357
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:21,807
Want some?

358
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:23,408
No, thanks.

359
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:26,876
Here we go.

360
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,787
Want some chili oil?

361
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:31,808
Don't mind me.

362
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:33,760
Let me do it myself.

363
00:19:48,326 --> 00:19:51,292
It's burning. Don't you mind it?

364
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:55,036
I love it.

365
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,186
There was one soup stall right next to my place downtown.

366
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:58,626
There was one soup stall right next to my place downtown.

367
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:01,020
You have a place downtown?

368
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,240
Yeah.

369
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,087
- Guess what it is.
- What is it?

370
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:05,860
Some bungalows in the alley by the Second Ring Road.

371
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,040
Some bungalows in the alley by the Second Ring Road.

372
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,096
Bungalows?

373
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:10,006
He's pretending to be rich.

374
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:12,020
I'll put him on the blacklist.

375
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:15,544
So many weirdoes nowadays.

376
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:18,566
Let me take you home.

377
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:20,166
It's okay. I usually get Uber.

378
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,048
I already got one.

379
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:02,176
Look at his Moments.

380
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:04,666
Acting mysterious.

381
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,212
Even if he's rich,

382
00:21:06,212 --> 00:21:08,576
I disapprove of his taste when he takes

383
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:09,756
a girl in high heels to stand on a bus

384
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:10,844
a girl in high heels to stand on a bus

385
00:21:10,844 --> 00:21:13,688
and then have lamb soup with him.

386
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:18,520
By the way, do you have any new players?

387
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:23,027
There is someone.

388
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:24,664
So pretentious.

389
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:30,468
It's my fault that we missed Green Energy.

390
00:21:30,468 --> 00:21:31,227
But we have a plan B. Walrus Technology.

391
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:33,340
But we have a plan B. Walrus Technology.

392
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,872
How's Walrus?

393
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,780
Just as I suspected, they're running out of venture capital

394
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,347
Just as I suspected, they're running out of venture capital

395
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:41,347
Just as I suspected, they're running out of venture capital

396
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:43,326
after the setbacks overseas.

397
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:44,267
The meta-universe and the virtual currency haven't made any profit.

398
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:45,304
The meta-universe and the virtual currency haven't made any profit.

399
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,720
The meta-universe and the virtual currency haven't made any profit.

400
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,307
So they're in dire need of someone to take over.

401
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:52,267
But the company valuation is still overly high.

402
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,536
But the company valuation is still overly high.

403
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,188
I'll find a way to drop the price.

404
00:21:57,507 --> 00:22:00,096
I heard that they have many legal risks.

405
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:01,146
That's right.

406
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:03,346
But the financial statement looks nice.

407
00:22:03,346 --> 00:22:06,272
I think Walrus is just a chess piece

408
00:22:06,272 --> 00:22:09,284
on the chessboard set up by Wanguo.

409
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:11,187
By the way, Ma left the company today.

410
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:15,108
By the way, Ma left the company today.

411
00:22:17,106 --> 00:22:18,752
Survival of the fittest is not just a law following Darwin's Theory of Evolution.

412
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:19,576
Survival of the fittest is not just a law following Darwin's Theory of Evolution.

413
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:21,987
Survival of the fittest is not just a law following Darwin's Theory of Evolution.

414
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:24,947
It also applies to corporations.

415
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:26,626
A lapse in judgment would lead the company to total disaster.

416
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:28,886
A lapse in judgment would lead the company to total disaster.

417
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:31,540
Countless employees would lose their jobs.

418
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:34,966
From my perspective, the only thing I can do is to meet my KPI.

419
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:37,980
From my perspective, the only thing I can do is to meet my KPI.

420
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:44,006
Walrus sounds a bit out of control.

421
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:47,200
But we don't have any better options.

422
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:49,706
If we're doing this, make a deal with Wanguo soon.

423
00:22:49,706 --> 00:22:51,744
If we're doing this, make a deal with Wanguo soon.

424
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
I'll leave you to handle the rest.

425
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,400
I'll leave you to handle the rest.

426
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:59,266
Got it. I'll work on it.

427
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:00,808
By the way, the secretariat got an anonymous complaint email

428
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:03,626
By the way, the secretariat got an anonymous complaint email

429
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:05,027
saying that you were asking your subordinates for work files at midnight

430
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:07,127
saying that you were asking your subordinates for work files at midnight

431
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:09,447
and favoring certain employees.

432
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:10,980
Do you know who sent it?

433
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,700
Probably.

434
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,104
But it's okay for them to complain.

435
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:21,412
- Miss Tang.
- Come on.

436
00:23:21,412 --> 00:23:22,127
- Everybody, grab one.
- Thank you, Miss Tang.

437
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:23,267
- Everybody, grab one.
- Thank you, Miss Tang.

438
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,944
- Everybody, grab one.
- Thank you, Miss Tang.

439
00:23:24,944 --> 00:23:28,187
Where's Ma? I got him one, too.

440
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:29,586
He's still working.

441
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:30,392
The case failed. Someone has to make things right.

442
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:32,906
The case failed. Someone has to make things right.

443
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:34,488
I told him we'd work overnight and he should rest at noon.

444
00:23:34,488 --> 00:23:36,292
I told him we'd work overnight and he should rest at noon.

445
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,016
But he wouldn't listen. He's skipping lunch like he's fighting battles.

446
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,600
But he wouldn't listen. He's skipping lunch like he's fighting battles.

447
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,000
But he wouldn't listen. He's skipping lunch like he's fighting battles.

448
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,400
[Ziyao doesn't know about the layoff. Don't tell her.]

449
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:48,508
Let's pack something for him.

450
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:50,107
- Brother Hao.
- Bubble tea.

451
00:23:50,107 --> 00:23:51,668
I got some.

452
00:23:51,668 --> 00:23:53,227
I didn't know that.

453
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:55,460
It's fine. It's not liquor. Just bubble tea. We can't overdrink.

454
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,348
It's fine. It's not liquor. Just bubble tea. We can't overdrink.

455
00:23:56,348 --> 00:23:58,976
Where's Ma Weiwei? Not done with the resignation…

456
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:06,240
Ziyao, don't overthink.

457
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,707
Mr. Ma's worried about you.

458
00:24:08,707 --> 00:24:09,526
It's no big deal. He can find another job.

459
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:12,220
It's no big deal. He can find another job.

460
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,556
It's okay.

461
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,256
Don't worry.

462
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:18,080
Let's keep it a secret.

463
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,527
What for?

464
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:21,217
He's just getting laid off.

465
00:24:21,217 --> 00:24:24,160
He'll get the compensation.

466
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,087
Mr. Xu is full of random ideas

467
00:24:25,087 --> 00:24:26,646
Mr. Xu is full of random ideas

468
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:29,256
but takes all the credit.

469
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:30,697
He knows that Mu has connections,

470
00:24:30,697 --> 00:24:33,686
so he takes him around all day long.

471
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:35,626
We're just tools and corporate slaves, huh?

472
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:37,577
We're just tools and corporate slaves, huh?

473
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,164
I'm here.

474
00:24:39,164 --> 00:24:41,267
I've been busy the entire morning

475
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:43,916
with a 40-page PowerPoint.

476
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,644
I didn't even drink water.

477
00:24:46,644 --> 00:24:47,666
What's the leader thinking? Why is he pushing me so hard?

478
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:50,144
What's the leader thinking? Why is he pushing me so hard?

479
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:51,357
Salad again? Want something else?

480
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:52,964
Salad again? Want something else?

481
00:24:52,964 --> 00:24:54,520
No, thanks.

482
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:58,967
Have you finished the financing report for the meeting?

483
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:00,444
It's done.

484
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:02,168
It's done?

485
00:25:03,646 --> 00:25:05,220
What were you saying?

486
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,106
Why aren't you talking?

487
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:09,686
It's nothing. Eat you lunch.

488
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:11,456
Go ahead.

489
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:03,900
Why did you get so many snacks?

490
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:07,582
Miss Tang, have you been through something like this?

491
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:11,320
Miss Tang, have you been through something like this?

492
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,582
It's like you've worked hard and obtained so much,

493
00:26:13,582 --> 00:26:15,982
It's like you've worked hard and obtained so much,

494
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:19,202
but sometimes you just feel

495
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,783
that everything is surreal.

496
00:26:25,842 --> 00:26:27,448
Yeah.

497
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,483
Of course.

498
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:33,262
I have that feeling every day.

499
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:40,542
Actually, I was thinking that

500
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:42,656
I quite envy you.

501
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:46,672
Miss Han may be a bit mean and may have a temper,

502
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,704
Miss Han may be a bit mean and may have a temper,

503
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:52,142
but she did get a project for Guo Yu.

504
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,460
What about Da Wang?

505
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:59,456
She slacks off work

506
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,024
and forbids others to work hard.

507
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:07,543
I don't think I'll ever make it.

508
00:27:10,303 --> 00:27:12,483
I guess everyone has something to worry about.

509
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:15,076
I guess everyone has something to worry about.

510
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,253
But anyway, we will move on.

511
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:23,588
But anyway, we will move on.

512
00:27:29,002 --> 00:27:32,322
Ma didn't mean to push you away.

513
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:35,083
Maybe he didn't think about it himself

514
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,764
about what he should do.

515
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:41,828
You should know that he can be overwhelmed by pressure sometimes.

516
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:45,120
You should know that he can be overwhelmed by pressure sometimes.

517
00:28:01,062 --> 00:28:03,193
Go to the office and send me the file tonight.

518
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:05,888
That company waiting to be listed…

519
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,583
That guy is Jin Hao's boss.

520
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:23,776
Ma keeps saying that their job is highly competitive

521
00:28:23,776 --> 00:28:26,483
and allows no mistakes.

522
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:30,240
So you're his last resort.

523
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,380
At least, you have each other.

524
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:35,900
Let's go.

525
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:02,082
The current capital environment is not good.

526
00:29:02,082 --> 00:29:04,483
If we miss Wanguo because you can't do green energy...

527
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:06,203
If we miss Wanguo because you can't do green energy...

528
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,363
I get it.

529
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:08,452
I will do my best not just for myself,

530
00:29:08,452 --> 00:29:10,393
I will do my best not just for myself,

531
00:29:10,393 --> 00:29:13,483
but also to keep my people from getting laid off.

532
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:16,242
Last place elimination. Ma Weiwei.

533
00:29:16,242 --> 00:29:18,200
It's him. Sign this.

534
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,800
♫ Wondering if they will ♫

535
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,543
Okay.

536
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:26,402
I can sign this.

537
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:28,968
But look.

538
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:33,362
Two-month compensation.

539
00:29:33,362 --> 00:29:36,702
Our finance department may not agree to it.

540
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:37,733
That's none of my business.

541
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:39,942
That's none of my business.

542
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:41,322
I'm asking for compensationmy subordinate deserves.

543
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:43,562
I'm asking for compensationmy subordinate deserves.

544
00:29:45,124 --> 00:29:47,936
Okay, I'll try.

545
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,322
Survival of the fittest

546
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:51,360
is not just a lawfollowing Darwin's Theory of Evolution.

547
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,662
is not just a lawfollowing Darwin's Theory of Evolution.

548
00:29:53,662 --> 00:29:55,533
It also applies to corporates.

549
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:57,082
The result will determine the sectioningof regions in the second half of the year.

550
00:29:57,082 --> 00:29:59,383
The result will determine the sectioningof regions in the second half of the year.

551
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:00,282
I bet you don't want toend up competing with local investment banks.

552
00:30:00,282 --> 00:30:03,630
I bet you don't want toend up competing with local investment banks.

553
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,840
♫ I need a peaceful moment ♫

554
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:15,100
♫ It's my time, I need to feel alive ♫

555
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,980
♫ The hearts align their hearbeat ♫

556
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:26,380
♫ Where the dreams are, the dreams are so close yet so ♫

557
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,780
♫ Yet so far to grasp... ♫

558
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:41,862
Xu Ziquan may be pretentious.

559
00:30:41,862 --> 00:30:44,063
But he really knows about perfume.

560
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,200
[Walrus]

561
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:07,900
Thank you.

562
00:31:09,182 --> 00:31:10,963
Hello, excuse me.

563
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:12,902
Isn't the meeting at 9:30 a.m.?

564
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:13,723
It's delayed. They're in the studio.

565
00:31:13,723 --> 00:31:15,382
It's delayed. They're in the studio.

566
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:17,322
Studio?

567
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:18,843
Pay attention to the overall…

568
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,383
Excuse me, please.

569
00:31:20,383 --> 00:31:21,923
Background.

570
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:22,932
- And this.
- Okay.

571
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:26,892
It's really close to what we want.

572
00:31:26,892 --> 00:31:28,580
Well.

573
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,816
Makeup.

574
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,003
Make-up artist.

575
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:34,176
- Here.
- Thank you.

576
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:36,702
Hello, want some snacks?

577
00:31:36,702 --> 00:31:38,743
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

578
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:43,422
- Here

579
00:31:43,422 --> 00:31:45,222
- Tang…
- Sis.

580
00:31:46,123 --> 00:31:47,902
Xinzi?

581
00:31:47,902 --> 00:31:48,983
Why are you here?

582
00:31:48,983 --> 00:31:51,422
I'm their client.

583
00:31:51,422 --> 00:31:52,823
Really?

584
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:56,164
So I'm the vendor of your vendor.

585
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:59,864
- New advertisement idea?
- Yeah.

586
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:01,923
The virtual image is trending among corporates.

587
00:32:01,923 --> 00:32:03,442
They use human figures.

588
00:32:03,442 --> 00:32:04,816
But this…

589
00:32:04,816 --> 00:32:06,303
A whale?

590
00:32:06,303 --> 00:32:10,422
Whales communicate through ultrasound.

591
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:11,643
The normal ultrasound frequency of whales is between 15 to 25 hertz.

592
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:13,762
The normal ultrasound frequency of whales is between 15 to 25 hertz.

593
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:17,200
But a whale named Alice

594
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,592
speaks at the frequency of 52 hertz.

595
00:32:19,592 --> 00:32:20,682
That means no other whale on Earth can hear it talk.

596
00:32:20,682 --> 00:32:22,304
That means no other whale on Earth can hear it talk.

597
00:32:22,304 --> 00:32:23,683
That means no other whale on Earth can hear it talk.

598
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:25,903
No friends. No families.

599
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:28,803
It swims in the oceans all alone.

600
00:32:28,803 --> 00:32:29,728
Someone discovered it and monitored it.

601
00:32:29,728 --> 00:32:30,902
Someone discovered it and monitored it.

602
00:32:30,902 --> 00:32:34,280
It swam from the Pacific to the Atlantic

603
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,163
through those ice-covered regions without ever stopping.

604
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,703
through those ice-covered regions without ever stopping.

605
00:32:37,703 --> 00:32:39,503
People were amazed.

606
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:43,022
What kind of power drove it to keep moving forward?

607
00:32:43,022 --> 00:32:44,522
That's our new brand ambassador, Alice.

608
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:46,064
That's our new brand ambassador, Alice.

609
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:51,163
It's loneliness.

610
00:32:51,163 --> 00:32:54,942
It's a whale who wants to be heard by its kind.

611
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:59,203
That's good. You got me moved.

612
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:03,042
A lonely whale.

613
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:14,023
Why are you here?

614
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:16,712
I'm also the vendor of the vendor.

615
00:33:20,203 --> 00:33:21,802
This is my sister Tang Ying.

616
00:33:21,802 --> 00:33:24,182
This is Xu Ziquan.

617
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:25,893
He's the obnoxious second guy.

618
00:33:25,893 --> 00:33:28,422
I know him.

619
00:33:28,422 --> 00:33:30,243
I'll check on the monitor.

620
00:33:30,243 --> 00:33:32,123
I have to keep an eye on them.

621
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:33,216
Go ahead.

622
00:33:33,216 --> 00:33:35,956
Director, let's do it.

623
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:37,372
Okay.

624
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:42,782
When did you come?

625
00:33:42,782 --> 00:33:44,572
Some time ago.

626
00:33:48,842 --> 00:33:53,000
Sure enough. This smell suits you better.

627
00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:59,082
You have such good taste that

628
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:00,323
I suspect if you are…

629
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:02,923
Let's not go there.

630
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:06,123
I'm just an ordinary delicate guy.

631
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:08,732
Okay.

632
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:21,060
What a coincidence.

633
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,364
We're working on the same case.

634
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:25,682
Yeah.

635
00:34:25,682 --> 00:34:29,028
At least, we won't be so lonely.

636
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:38,702
Miss Wang.

637
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,316
What a social network.

638
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:44,403
That girl is my little sister,

639
00:34:44,403 --> 00:34:46,908
the client who wants the promotional video.

640
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:51,300
The handsome banker is also your sister?

641
00:34:51,863 --> 00:34:54,863
He's my friend.

642
00:34:54,863 --> 00:34:56,662
That's good.

643
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:58,003
Since you're friends, this case is yours.

644
00:34:58,003 --> 00:35:00,362
Since you're friends, this case is yours.

645
00:35:00,362 --> 00:35:02,042
Attend the meeting later.

646
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:04,268
I have things to do back at the office.

647
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,883
I-I haven't worked on an M&A before.

648
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:09,143
The case you tried to get was an M&A.

649
00:35:09,143 --> 00:35:11,283
You made a huge fuss about it.

650
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:13,162
B-But I was only in charge of the IP Rights last time.

651
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:14,522
B-But I was only in charge of the IP Rights last time.

652
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:18,183
Exactly. There's always a first time.

653
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,783
It's your chance to grow and thrive.

654
00:35:21,842 --> 00:35:23,384
Go for it.

655
00:35:35,562 --> 00:35:37,404
Go for it.

656
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:40,023
Hello, Mr. Xu.

657
00:35:40,023 --> 00:35:41,202
Welcome. Sit.

658
00:35:41,202 --> 00:35:42,672
All right.

659
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,002
Ms. Hua.

660
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:50,132
Bring Miss Tang a chair.

661
00:35:50,132 --> 00:35:50,656
No need. I'm fine here.

662
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,872
No need. I'm fine here.

663
00:35:51,872 --> 00:35:53,503
Come over here.

664
00:35:53,503 --> 00:35:55,000
Come on.

665
00:36:02,642 --> 00:36:04,482
Well, Ms. Hua.

666
00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:06,543
Let's start the meeting.

667
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:07,343
- Okay.
- Okay.

668
00:36:07,343 --> 00:36:08,803
I'd like to address our opinion

669
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:12,360
as the investment bank regarding the current situation.

670
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,376
This is Walrus Technology's prospectus in the US

671
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:17,763
This is Walrus Technology's prospectus in the US

672
00:36:17,763 --> 00:36:20,222
back in the day.

673
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:22,263
I read it carefully.

674
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,243
I don't know which law firm offered consultancy

675
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:26,322
but I guess it can't be Junheng Lawfirm here. Right?

676
00:36:26,322 --> 00:36:30,376
but I guess it can't be Junheng Lawfirm here. Right?

677
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:35,322
The section on risk factors

678
00:36:35,322 --> 00:36:39,222
is written exactly like the Facebook IPO in 2012.

679
00:36:39,222 --> 00:36:43,064
Miss Tang, are you aware of that?

680
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:48,664
Please illustrate.

681
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,822
Of course.

682
00:36:53,822 --> 00:36:57,082
It was a famous case.

683
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,763
Back then,

684
00:36:58,763 --> 00:37:02,022
a young lawyer came up with...

685
00:37:03,562 --> 00:37:06,702
a somewhat cunning strategy.

686
00:37:06,702 --> 00:37:09,863
He used lengthy paragraphs of superfluous words

687
00:37:09,863 --> 00:37:11,903
to illustrate the risk factors

688
00:37:11,903 --> 00:37:15,983
so that the readers lose interest in the article,

689
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,323
hoping that the investors would miss the essential risk factors.

690
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:19,803
hoping that the investors would miss the essential risk factors.

691
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:21,128
Yeah.

692
00:37:21,128 --> 00:37:23,043
This prospectus is so well-done that I had to

693
00:37:23,043 --> 00:37:25,563
This prospectus is so well-done that I had to

694
00:37:25,563 --> 00:37:27,002
gulp down five or six cups of coffee to read it overnight.

695
00:37:27,002 --> 00:37:29,724
gulp down five or six cups of coffee to read it overnight.

696
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,602
But out of respect for Wanguo's intent to acquire it,

697
00:37:32,602 --> 00:37:35,656
But out of respect for Wanguo's intent to acquire it,

698
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:38,702
my colleagues and I rewrote the prospectus.

699
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:40,540
Hand them out.

700
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,143
Please take a look.

701
00:37:47,143 --> 00:37:49,828
Let's talk about it.

702
00:37:51,682 --> 00:37:53,712
Thank you for your effort, Mr. Xu.

703
00:37:53,712 --> 00:37:54,963
Thank you for your effort, Mr. Xu.

704
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:56,203
We will read this file with great concern.

705
00:37:56,203 --> 00:37:59,883
We will read this file with great concern.

706
00:37:59,883 --> 00:38:01,132
Thank you.

707
00:38:01,132 --> 00:38:02,652
Also, Miss Tang Ying,

708
00:38:02,652 --> 00:38:04,362
Also, Miss Tang Ying,

709
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:07,863
please be lenient because we're just a startup.

710
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:09,764
Definitely.

711
00:38:12,883 --> 00:38:14,562
Mu, sort out the files and send them to Ms. Hua.

712
00:38:14,562 --> 00:38:15,652
Mu, sort out the files and send them to Ms. Hua.

713
00:38:15,652 --> 00:38:16,736
Okay.

714
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,712
- Thank you, Mr. Xu.
- No problem.

715
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,596
Is Little Red Riding Hood your sister, Little Red Teeth?

716
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:50,976
So annoying.

717
00:39:00,122 --> 00:39:03,282
Sure, I won't remind you next time.

718
00:39:14,568 --> 00:39:15,963
Where are you going?

719
00:39:15,963 --> 00:39:17,283
To the law firm.

720
00:39:17,283 --> 00:39:19,368
Let me give you a ride.

721
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:53,863
Is that a new fragrance?

722
00:39:55,368 --> 00:39:56,256
I'll get you one from the trunk.

723
00:39:56,256 --> 00:39:57,980
I'll get you one from the trunk.

724
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,584
I've been working on this project.

725
00:40:00,584 --> 00:40:01,483
I don't want one. I don't have a car.

726
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:03,008
I don't want one. I don't have a car.

727
00:40:03,008 --> 00:40:04,142
Leave it in the office.

728
00:40:04,142 --> 00:40:06,396
I don't have an office.

729
00:40:07,522 --> 00:40:09,476
Put it in the bathroom.

730
00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:17,328
The AC is too strong. Turn it down a bit.

731
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:18,852
Okay.

732
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,322
A bit more.

733
00:40:23,322 --> 00:40:24,703
Okay, Boss.

734
00:40:24,703 --> 00:40:26,564
Happy now?

735
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,062
Hello, Miss Wang.

736
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,263
Hello, how did it go? What did the bankers say?

737
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:35,562
Hello, how did it go? What did the bankers say?

738
00:40:35,562 --> 00:40:37,093
When will you sign the contract?

739
00:40:37,093 --> 00:40:39,002
Miss Wang, it's our first meeting.

740
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,800
We're not there yet.

741
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,443
I know they're not trustworthy.

742
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:46,063
They keep working on those projects

743
00:40:46,063 --> 00:40:47,633
and barely make it.

744
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:48,883
So where are you? When will you be back?

745
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:50,276
So where are you? When will you be back?

746
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:52,022
I'm on the way. Almost there.

747
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:54,722
The policy analysis for Liu Meiling is not ready.

748
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:55,776
The policy analysis for Liu Meiling is not ready.

749
00:40:55,776 --> 00:40:57,242
- Come back and finish it.
- Okay.

750
00:40:57,242 --> 00:40:58,908
Hurry up.

751
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:08,224
Investment bankers. Untrustworthy.

752
00:41:23,963 --> 00:41:26,022
All right, rest assured.

753
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:29,042
Even though it's your first meeting,

754
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:32,000
you should follow up on it.

755
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,763
And your expressions.

756
00:41:33,763 --> 00:41:36,363
Sometimes, I just don't get it. It's like you're sneering.

757
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:37,602
Sometimes, I just don't get it. It's like you're sneering.

758
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:39,023
What is that?

759
00:41:39,023 --> 00:41:41,642
How would the clients feel?

760
00:41:43,122 --> 00:41:45,002
Listen, we'll give you another chance

761
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,440
and ask you something even pigs can answer.

762
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,622
You can leave if you get it right.

763
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,596
Pick three words.

764
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,403
Sis.

765
00:41:56,403 --> 00:41:59,222
Why are you so late?

766
00:41:59,222 --> 00:42:00,443
Working overtime.

767
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:02,703
It'd be weird if I were home early.

768
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:10,162
Look at you.

769
00:42:10,162 --> 00:42:13,063
You're so well-composed around men.

770
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,263
But you're so sloppy at home.

771
00:42:14,263 --> 00:42:16,732
But you're so sloppy at home.

772
00:42:18,343 --> 00:42:21,123
I make things tough for them to test them.

773
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:22,803
Why would I be hard on myself when I'm alone?

774
00:42:22,803 --> 00:42:24,383
Why would I be hard on myself when I'm alone?

775
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,223
You always have so many theories.

776
00:42:27,223 --> 00:42:29,003
Are you hungry? Want some noodles?

777
00:42:29,003 --> 00:42:31,102
No, I just ate.

778
00:42:34,148 --> 00:42:35,692
How's everything going with Xu Jiabai?

779
00:42:35,692 --> 00:42:36,616
How's everything going with Xu Jiabai?

780
00:42:36,616 --> 00:42:38,443
It's going nowhere.

781
00:42:38,443 --> 00:42:40,548
The older guy is gone.

782
00:42:40,548 --> 00:42:43,040
You only have Xu Jiabai left.

783
00:42:44,222 --> 00:42:46,102
You're underestimating me.

784
00:42:46,102 --> 00:42:48,363
I have many pursuers.

785
00:42:48,363 --> 00:42:49,743
That's good.

786
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:51,463
Open your eyes and look closely.

787
00:42:51,463 --> 00:42:53,702
Choose carefully.

788
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:57,003
Don't let Xu Jiabai get what he wants too fast.

789
00:42:57,003 --> 00:42:59,043
He left a bad impression on me.

790
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,423
There's something about him.

791
00:43:00,423 --> 00:43:02,523
You should be careful.

792
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:06,622
Rest assured, sis.

793
00:43:06,622 --> 00:43:09,122
Do you think I'm an amateur?

794
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,513
Sis, what time is it?

795
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:38,643
6:20 a.m.

796
00:43:41,303 --> 00:43:43,363
Xinzi,

797
00:43:43,363 --> 00:43:47,128
can we sleep with the curtain closed?

798
00:43:48,622 --> 00:43:52,543
Then we won't be awakened by the sun.

799
00:44:02,702 --> 00:44:04,576
Good morning, Xinzi.

800
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:10,083
I fell asleep early last night.

801
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:13,203
I want chocolate fondant.

802
00:44:15,243 --> 00:44:17,563
Okay, I'll get it for you.

803
00:44:17,563 --> 00:44:19,243
I'm getting up.

804
00:44:19,243 --> 00:44:21,522
I'll meet a friend today.

805
00:44:22,122 --> 00:44:24,702
Which hottie is it?

806
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,943
Player No.1.

807
00:44:31,943 --> 00:44:33,682
The first thing Xu Jiabai does

808
00:44:33,682 --> 00:44:36,863
right after he wakes up is to tell Xinzi "Good morning".

809
00:44:36,863 --> 00:44:38,883
And the last thing he does before going to bed

810
00:44:38,883 --> 00:44:41,062
is to tell her "Good night".

811
00:44:41,062 --> 00:44:42,863
She rarely replies.

812
00:44:42,863 --> 00:44:45,243
But it doesn't undermine his passion.

813
00:44:45,243 --> 00:44:48,682
Xinzi is like everything to him.

814
00:44:48,682 --> 00:44:50,293
Whenever she reacts a bit,

815
00:44:50,293 --> 00:44:52,082
he becomes more attentive.

816
00:44:52,082 --> 00:44:55,923
Even if Xinzi avoids starting a serious relationship with him,

817
00:44:55,923 --> 00:44:58,102
he doesn't care.

818
00:44:58,102 --> 00:45:00,003
He's willing to drown in this sweet dream.

819
00:45:00,003 --> 00:45:01,863
He's willing to drown in this sweet dream.

820
00:45:01,863 --> 00:45:05,702
Being devoted may be another trick they play. Right?

821
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,062
But Xinzi says that Xu Jiabai is really nice to her.

822
00:45:07,062 --> 00:45:09,423
But Xinzi says that Xu Jiabai is really nice to her.

823
00:45:09,423 --> 00:45:11,123
He's serious.

824
00:45:11,123 --> 00:45:12,492
How nice can he be?

825
00:45:12,492 --> 00:45:15,882
A thousand times better than you.

826
00:45:16,644 --> 00:45:18,202
What's wrong? Is it wrong to be nice?

827
00:45:18,202 --> 00:45:19,263
What's wrong? Is it wrong to be nice?

828
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:21,422
It's not, but…

829
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:22,843
Boss.

830
00:45:22,843 --> 00:45:24,940
- Mr. Xu.< br> - Ms. Hua, just a minute.

831
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,420
All right.

832
00:45:27,502 --> 00:45:29,142
It's good to be nice to someone.

833
00:45:29,142 --> 00:45:31,502
But it's not love.

834
00:45:31,502 --> 00:45:32,992
Do girls always mistake the feeling of being moved for love?

835
00:45:32,992 --> 00:45:34,812
Do girls always mistake the feeling of being moved for love?

836
00:45:35,502 --> 00:45:37,642
I won't be moved by my pursuers

837
00:45:37,642 --> 00:45:41,043
and will never fall in love because I'm moved.

838
00:45:41,043 --> 00:45:42,243
Why not?

839
00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:43,542
Think about it. If someone pursues you

840
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:45,222
Think about it. If someone pursues you

841
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:47,423
it means you have something he wants.

842
00:45:47,423 --> 00:45:48,903
But you don't like him.

843
00:45:48,903 --> 00:45:50,033
That means he doesn't have the things you want.

844
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:52,242
That means he doesn't have the things you want.

845
00:45:52,242 --> 00:45:54,172
If you end up with him

846
00:45:54,172 --> 00:45:56,682
because he's nice to you,

847
00:45:56,682 --> 00:45:57,864
aren't you…

848
00:45:57,864 --> 00:45:59,763
...being taken advantage of?

849
00:45:59,763 --> 00:46:01,342
Not exactly.

850
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,182
It's like going against your heart.

851
00:46:03,182 --> 00:46:05,743
It's like going against your heart.

852
00:46:06,423 --> 00:46:07,913
You should make sure that

853
00:46:07,913 --> 00:46:10,913
you want to be with someone because you like him,

854
00:46:10,913 --> 00:46:13,763
not because he's nice to you.

855
00:46:13,763 --> 00:46:15,808
It's like trying to get by.

856
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:18,683
That's an interesting thought.

857
00:46:18,683 --> 00:46:20,863
How is it interesting?

858
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:23,223
It's full of ambition.

859
00:46:24,182 --> 00:46:25,863
Ambitious women are not so appealing to men. Right?

860
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:28,320
Ambitious women are not so appealing to men. Right?

861
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,753
Only the ones who are more ambitious than us.

862
00:46:31,753 --> 00:46:32,943
There's only one goal.

863
00:46:32,943 --> 00:46:34,423
Have her under control.

864
00:46:34,423 --> 00:46:35,762
And there's one criterion.

865
00:46:35,762 --> 00:46:37,568
She must look pretty.

866
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:40,956
Don't worry about that.

867
00:46:41,702 --> 00:46:43,263
Any guy without visual impairment would find you pretty.

868
00:46:43,263 --> 00:46:45,382
Any guy without visual impairment would find you pretty.

869
00:46:55,202 --> 00:46:56,828
Sis.

870
00:46:57,572 --> 00:46:59,402
Have some blueberries.

871
00:47:00,303 --> 00:47:02,292
You got so many?

872
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:03,843
Supermarket sale?

873
00:47:03,843 --> 00:47:07,683
Yeah, no. Player No.1 gave me those.

874
00:47:08,403 --> 00:47:10,323
Really?

875
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:13,223
Try some.

876
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:16,762
He gave you so many?

877
00:47:16,762 --> 00:47:21,003
Are you getting serious?

878
00:47:21,003 --> 00:47:22,792
No way.

879
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:25,822
True love must withstand the test of time.

880
00:47:25,822 --> 00:47:28,102
I've failed once with Chen Mo.

881
00:47:28,102 --> 00:47:29,642
I dare not rush it.

882
00:47:29,642 --> 00:47:32,423
I think I should observe him more.

883
00:47:32,423 --> 00:47:35,103
Someone has become smart.

884
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:37,824
Yeah, I got this. Don't worry.

885
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:43,360
You have a package.

886
00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:46,043
Oh, my gosh.

887
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:47,373
What did you get?

888
00:47:47,373 --> 00:47:49,880
- No idea.
- You got paid?

889
00:47:51,506 --> 00:47:52,858
[Clothes]

890
00:47:54,383 --> 00:47:56,542
I'll be in my room.

891
00:48:14,843 --> 00:48:16,123
You know, Tang?

892
00:48:16,123 --> 00:48:18,583
The rarity of something must be

893
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:20,382
inversely proportional to its accessibility.

894
00:48:20,382 --> 00:48:22,863
inversely proportional to its accessibility.

895
00:48:22,863 --> 00:48:25,103
If you want to look prestigious,

896
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:26,622
don't take your chances

897
00:48:26,622 --> 00:48:29,303
and get luxuries that are left behind.

898
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:31,162
What Liu Meiling said made me realize

899
00:48:31,162 --> 00:48:34,202
that I can't water down the investment in myself.

900
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,723
Every impulse spending

901
00:48:35,723 --> 00:48:38,312
and every installment made with gritted teeth

902
00:48:38,312 --> 00:48:41,682
is the motivation that drives me to work.

903
00:48:41,682 --> 00:48:42,973
I believe that one day my elegance

904
00:48:42,973 --> 00:48:44,433
I believe that one day my elegance

905
00:48:44,433 --> 00:48:47,528
won't be attached to poverty.

906
00:48:58,823 --> 00:49:01,333
Something happened, you know?

907
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:02,843
What's wrong?

908
00:49:02,843 --> 00:49:04,943
An official account posted several articles

909
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:08,123
trash-talking our group on everything.

910
00:49:08,123 --> 00:49:10,272
The leader got furious and couldn't even hold the cup.

911
00:49:10,272 --> 00:49:13,142
If the articles get reposted,

912
00:49:13,142 --> 00:49:15,762
public opinion will get out of control.

913
00:49:15,762 --> 00:49:18,642
What's your boss going to do?

914
00:49:18,642 --> 00:49:21,183
You should issue a lawyer's letter as a warning

915
00:49:21,183 --> 00:49:24,000
so that he takes down all those articles.

916
00:49:25,768 --> 00:49:27,424
Go ahead.

917
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:31,940
What are you waiting for? Go.

918
00:49:34,923 --> 00:49:37,000
I have a meeting with Walrus.

919
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,723
It's about time.

920
00:49:39,202 --> 00:49:43,222
Why do you care so much about a random case?

921
00:49:43,222 --> 00:49:45,683
What is Geer Group to us?

922
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:48,182
Our most important client.

923
00:49:48,182 --> 00:49:51,208
Can't you see the priority here?

924
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,696
Go now.

925
00:49:53,662 --> 00:49:55,443
All right.

926
00:49:55,443 --> 00:49:58,653
It's just a lawyer's letter. No big deal. Come on.

927
00:49:58,653 --> 00:49:59,943
Tang, draft it in the car. Go ahead.

928
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:02,283
Tang, draft it in the car. Go ahead.

929
00:50:02,283 --> 00:50:03,784
Thank you, Mrs. Meiling.

930
00:50:03,784 --> 00:50:06,083
See you later.

931
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:07,863
Miss Wang.

932
00:50:07,863 --> 00:50:09,903
See you.

933
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:12,542
- No rush.
- Thanks, Mrs. Meiling.

934
00:50:43,843 --> 00:50:45,560
Xinzi.

935
00:50:47,652 --> 00:50:49,404
Xinzi.

936
00:50:50,282 --> 00:50:51,900
Xinzi.

937
00:50:53,096 --> 00:50:55,123
Yang Guo waited 16 years for Xiaolongnv.

938
00:50:55,123 --> 00:50:57,283
Gatsby waited five years for Daisy.

939
00:50:57,283 --> 00:50:59,143
Chen Mo hit a new record waiting

940
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:01,303
for Lin Xinzi from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

941
00:51:01,303 --> 00:51:04,004
A lunch date became a dinner date.

942
00:51:06,283 --> 00:51:07,582
Let's make it clear.

943
00:51:07,582 --> 00:51:09,763
Think twice.

944
00:51:10,816 --> 00:51:12,442
- Yeah, you're right.
- Right?

945
00:51:12,442 --> 00:51:15,183
It is a bit harsh.

946
00:51:15,183 --> 00:51:17,463
- Exactly, right?
- Yeah.

947
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,823
Think about it.

948
00:51:20,823 --> 00:51:22,723
What should I do?

949
00:51:24,102 --> 00:51:27,122
These are the things we try our best to strive for.

950
00:51:27,122 --> 00:51:29,363
It doesn't matter if you can't get it.

951
00:51:29,363 --> 00:51:30,404
Are you cold?

952
00:51:30,404 --> 00:51:32,184
Let's switch seats.

953
00:51:32,184 --> 00:51:33,522
That's…

954
00:51:42,912 --> 00:51:46,082
Ms. Hua, excuse me.

955
00:51:46,082 --> 00:51:50,582
Isn't the AC too strong in here?

956
00:51:50,582 --> 00:51:51,776
Isn't the AC too strong in here?

957
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:54,560
Just a second. Liu!

958
00:51:55,383 --> 00:51:57,020
Liu!

959
00:51:57,722 --> 00:51:59,562
- Ms. Hua.
- What's wrong with the AC? It's too cold.

960
00:51:59,562 --> 00:52:01,200
- Ms. Hua.
- What's wrong with the AC? It's too cold.

961
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:01,803
Sorry, Ms. Hua. It's been broken for days.

962
00:52:01,803 --> 00:52:03,343
Sorry, Ms. Hua. It's been broken for days.

963
00:52:03,343 --> 00:52:04,522
We contacted maintenance.

964
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:06,123
They'll be here in two hours.

965
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,722
There's traffic due to the rain.

966
00:52:07,722 --> 00:52:10,953
How about this? Let's take a break.

967
00:52:10,953 --> 00:52:12,602
Have some warm tea outside. Okay?

968
00:52:12,602 --> 00:52:14,264
Sure.

969
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,202
[Your bank account received 22,194.2 yuan.]

970
00:52:29,704 --> 00:52:31,160
Yes!

971
00:52:38,483 --> 00:52:40,073
Is the water boiling?

972
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,464
Still waiting.

973
00:52:46,682 --> 00:52:48,483
Tea or coffee?

974
00:52:48,483 --> 00:52:50,368
Tea.

975
00:52:54,820 --> 00:53:01,350
♫ I make a wish and hope to see you there ♫

976
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:10,250
♫ I make a wish that someday it comes true ♫

977
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:23,820
♫ I have a coin that's ready to be tossed ♫

978
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:30,350
♫ A shooting star goes by but my heart is lost ♫

979
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:38,610
♫ I weep in me for mistletoe I've lost ♫

980
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:46,160
♫ If it's love showing up at my door ♫

981
00:53:46,162 --> 00:53:47,560
- Let me.
- Okay.

982
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:55,200
♫ I shall be blessed with luck evermore ♫

983
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,670
Wait.

984
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:08,040
♫ Should I be waiting to be loved by you? ♫

985
00:54:08,042 --> 00:54:09,882
It won't burn like this.

986
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,384
Thanks.

987
00:54:13,682 --> 00:54:16,023
Actually, you're not a bad person.

988
00:54:16,023 --> 00:54:18,540
Actually, you're not a bad person.

989
00:54:20,003 --> 00:54:22,522
Where does that come from?

990
00:54:23,063 --> 00:54:25,200
I mean it.

991
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,700
Thanks.

992
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,288
Back to the meeting.

993
00:54:30,522 --> 00:54:33,792
Mr. Xu, we've read this file really carefully.

994
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:37,062
Mr. Xu, we've read this file really carefully.

995
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:41,532
We all agree that your revisions and additions are excellent.

996
00:54:55,762 --> 00:54:58,022
One more ahead.

997
00:54:58,022 --> 00:54:59,443
They have nice clothes.

998
00:54:59,443 --> 00:55:01,632
All right, let's go.

999
00:55:03,144 --> 00:55:04,200
Are you tired?

1000
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,172
No, I'm full of energy.

1001
00:55:18,722 --> 00:55:20,252
Here.

1002
00:55:28,062 --> 00:55:31,012
It's nice. It suits you.

1003
00:55:33,576 --> 00:55:34,800
How do I look?

1004
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,343
You always look amazing.

1005
00:55:36,343 --> 00:55:38,122
Let me take some photos.

1006
00:55:38,122 --> 00:55:41,024
Yeah, look at me.

1007
00:55:41,024 --> 00:55:42,563
- Another angle.
- Yeah.

1008
00:55:42,563 --> 00:55:43,923
Your legs look really long.

1009
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,600
Gorgeous.

1010
00:55:46,704 --> 00:55:47,460
Thanks.

1011
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,436
My pleasure. See you.

1012
00:55:51,262 --> 00:55:54,504
Xinzi, I paid. Let's go.

1013
00:55:55,648 --> 00:55:57,984
Jiabai, I want this ice cream.

1014
00:55:57,984 --> 00:56:00,260
All right, I'll get it for you.

1015
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:03,203
- Which floor?
- It's not here. It's in the North Wing.

1016
00:56:03,203 --> 00:56:04,652
North Wing.

1017
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,443
All right, wait here.

1018
00:56:06,443 --> 00:56:08,522
It's raining. Don't get a cold.

1019
00:56:08,522 --> 00:56:09,664
Wait for me.

1020
00:56:09,664 --> 00:56:11,876
- North Wing.
- Okay.

1021
00:56:25,702 --> 00:56:27,320
You have a date?

1022
00:56:29,383 --> 00:56:30,483
Why?

1023
00:56:30,483 --> 00:56:33,343
Don't I patch up my makeup after work every day?

1024
00:56:33,343 --> 00:56:35,336
Really?

1025
00:56:35,336 --> 00:56:38,784
But you look different today.

1026
00:56:40,343 --> 00:56:41,508
There's something.

1027
00:56:41,508 --> 00:56:42,762
How am I different?

1028
00:56:42,762 --> 00:56:44,732
What do you mean?

1029
00:56:48,202 --> 00:56:50,763
It's just a good-looking dinner mate.

1030
00:56:50,763 --> 00:56:53,883
It's just a good-looking dinner mate.

1031
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,736
Xinzi!

1032
00:57:03,912 --> 00:57:05,622
Why are you here?

1033
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,282
Did you get rained on?

1034
00:57:07,282 --> 00:57:08,943
I'm waiting for you.

1035
00:57:08,943 --> 00:57:12,264
I'm not so inconsiderate. Okay?

1036
00:57:16,022 --> 00:57:18,802
The ice cream hasn't melted.

1037
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,544
Have it.

1038
00:57:22,882 --> 00:57:26,182
Wait, you have something on your eyelid.

1039
00:57:26,182 --> 00:57:27,402
Don't move. Let me help.

1040
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,684
Close your eyes.

1041
00:57:28,684 --> 00:57:29,896
What is it?

1042
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:31,348
Don't move.

1043
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:36,732
Xinzi.

1044
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:49,504
I was lining up for the ice cream.

1045
00:57:49,504 --> 00:57:50,856
And I saw this.

1046
00:57:50,856 --> 00:57:53,223
I thought it'd suit you, so I got it.

1047
00:57:55,532 --> 00:57:57,088
Let me put it on you.

1048
00:58:27,802 --> 00:58:29,632
Do you like it?

1049
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:36,132
Oh, my god.

1050
00:59:37,322 --> 00:59:39,863
It's so close.

1051
00:59:39,863 --> 00:59:41,502
So what?

1052
00:59:41,502 --> 00:59:44,362
Shall we go somewhere further?

1053
00:59:44,362 --> 00:59:46,660
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1054
00:59:50,642 --> 00:59:52,376
Okay, thank you.

1055
00:59:52,376 --> 00:59:52,928
Excuse me. Keep the coat for us, please.

1056
00:59:52,928 --> 00:59:54,483
Excuse me. Keep the coat for us, please.

1057
00:59:54,483 --> 00:59:56,063
- All right.
- Thank you.

1058
00:59:56,063 --> 00:59:57,082
Shall we sit here?

1059
00:59:57,082 --> 00:59:58,652
Okay.

1060
01:00:05,672 --> 01:00:07,328
Thank you.

1061
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:11,782
You should buy me dinner more often.

1062
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:13,643
What's wrong?

1063
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:15,660
The files are hurting my eyes.

1064
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,422
A handsome man is a remedy.

1065
01:00:19,163 --> 01:00:21,183
- Waiter.
- Coming.

1066
01:00:21,183 --> 01:00:22,788
I want to order.

1067
01:00:24,302 --> 01:00:25,956
Can I ask you something?

1068
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,363
How can you say something flirty so calmly and at ease?

1069
01:00:27,363 --> 01:00:29,228
How can you say something flirty so calmly and at ease?

1070
01:00:30,183 --> 01:00:33,504
I guess it's because I'm not into you.

1071
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:37,028
But I can be into you if you want.

1072
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:40,448
Come on.

1073
01:00:45,722 --> 01:00:48,762
Actually, I don't want a relationship.

1074
01:00:48,762 --> 01:00:50,900
You're not meant to have relationships.

1075
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:53,440
You're such a playboy.

1076
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,662
You're such a playboy.

1077
01:00:54,662 --> 01:00:57,116
Who can possibly handle that?

1078
01:00:57,743 --> 01:01:00,283
I haven't always been like this.

1079
01:01:03,122 --> 01:01:05,483
So you got hurt by your ex?

1080
01:01:05,483 --> 01:01:08,284
And now you're taking revenge indiscriminately?

1081
01:01:08,904 --> 01:01:10,628
Not really.

1082
01:01:11,283 --> 01:01:13,676
She wanted to get married.

1083
01:01:13,676 --> 01:01:15,912
But I thought it was too early.

1084
01:01:15,912 --> 01:01:17,622
So we parted on bad terms.

1085
01:01:17,622 --> 01:01:19,772
So we parted on bad terms.

1086
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:29,522
Jingxin.

1087
01:01:29,522 --> 01:01:31,840
All right, just a second.

1088
01:01:39,322 --> 01:01:40,456
Who is that?

1089
01:01:40,456 --> 01:01:41,682
Jingxin. She's here for a file.

1090
01:01:41,682 --> 01:01:43,080
I'll give it to her.

1091
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,064
Do you need anything? I'll go to the convenience store.

1092
01:01:44,064 --> 01:01:45,768
Do you need anything? I'll go to the convenience store.

1093
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:47,043
Who is Jingxin?

1094
01:01:47,043 --> 01:01:50,020
The intern you saw during the video chat.

1095
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,304
I've shown you.

1096
01:01:51,304 --> 01:01:53,493
She's traveling for due diligence tomorrow.

1097
01:01:53,493 --> 01:01:55,523
But I brought the list back home.

1098
01:01:55,523 --> 01:01:57,302
Why does she have to come at this hour?

1099
01:01:57,302 --> 01:01:59,613
Can't she pick it up at work tomorrow?

1100
01:01:59,613 --> 01:02:01,032
That'd be too late.

1101
01:02:01,032 --> 01:02:02,016
Besides, do you want me to go to work at 5:00 a.m.?

1102
01:02:02,016 --> 01:02:04,682
Besides, do you want me to go to work at 5:00 a.m.?

1103
01:02:04,682 --> 01:02:05,728
Go ahead.

1104
01:02:05,728 --> 01:02:08,363
- Why do you even tell me?
- Come on.

1105
01:02:08,363 --> 01:02:10,822
Why are you mad again?

1106
01:02:10,822 --> 01:02:12,622
Anyway, you chose the intern over your girlfriend.

1107
01:02:12,622 --> 01:02:14,988
Anyway, you chose the intern over your girlfriend.

1108
01:02:14,988 --> 01:02:18,003
How's that even relevant?

1109
01:02:34,003 --> 01:02:36,192
Can you stay?

1110
01:02:39,262 --> 01:02:40,373
Fine, I'll stay.

1111
01:02:40,373 --> 01:02:42,043
Give it to her.

1112
01:02:44,403 --> 01:02:46,623
I'll leave if you go.

1113
01:02:55,592 --> 01:02:57,080
Cheers.

1114
01:03:02,182 --> 01:03:04,122
Anyway, there is no right and wrong in love.

1115
01:03:04,122 --> 01:03:06,264
Anyway, there is no right and wrong in love.

1116
01:03:06,264 --> 01:03:08,203
Just different stances.

1117
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,800
Yeah.

1118
01:03:10,823 --> 01:03:11,883
So this experience taught me that

1119
01:03:11,883 --> 01:03:13,956
So this experience taught me that

1120
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,943
once you're in a relationship,

1121
01:03:16,943 --> 01:03:18,922
someone has to make compromises

1122
01:03:18,922 --> 01:03:20,843
and someone has to accept it. Right?

1123
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:23,722
But I don't want to change anyone or get changed.

1124
01:03:23,722 --> 01:03:25,943
But I don't want to change anyone or get changed.

1125
01:03:25,943 --> 01:03:27,312
Agreed.

1126
01:03:28,162 --> 01:03:31,883
Everyone has the right to be themselves.

1127
01:03:31,883 --> 01:03:33,128
Nobody wants to be tamed. Me neither.

1128
01:03:33,128 --> 01:03:33,952
Nobody wants to be tamed. Me neither.

1129
01:03:33,952 --> 01:03:36,362
I hate being told what to do.

1130
01:03:36,362 --> 01:03:38,863
But most people don't get it.

1131
01:03:44,522 --> 01:03:48,443
Some people call those who are independent

1132
01:03:48,443 --> 01:03:51,504
"incapable of love."

1133
01:03:51,504 --> 01:03:53,256
But nobody cares.

1134
01:03:53,256 --> 01:03:55,082
You know what?

1135
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,682
Sometimes, guys just prefer hanging out with guys.

1136
01:03:56,682 --> 01:03:59,242
Sometimes, guys just prefer hanging out with guys.

1137
01:03:59,242 --> 01:04:00,956
Okay.

1138
01:04:03,502 --> 01:04:06,083
I'll tell you something in return.

1139
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:07,563
Many women think that a soap opera or a fancy handbag

1140
01:04:07,563 --> 01:04:11,172
Many women think that a soap opera or a fancy handbag

1141
01:04:11,172 --> 01:04:14,688
causes greater dopamine secretion than men.

1142
01:04:15,624 --> 01:04:17,312
All right.

1143
01:04:18,023 --> 01:04:20,043
My turn.

1144
01:04:20,043 --> 01:04:22,223
Many men are...

1145
01:04:22,883 --> 01:04:25,883
are lazy, dirty, arrogant

1146
01:04:25,883 --> 01:04:29,663
and have no taste at all. Right?

1147
01:04:29,663 --> 01:04:31,328
Yes.

1148
01:04:33,642 --> 01:04:35,662
Since we're going there,

1149
01:04:35,662 --> 01:04:37,522
let me say something.

1150
01:04:37,522 --> 01:04:39,763
I do acknowledge that

1151
01:04:39,763 --> 01:04:41,120
some women are a bit sticky in their relationships.

1152
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,222
some women are a bit sticky in their relationships.

1153
01:04:44,222 --> 01:04:45,202
They lack confidence and a sense of security.

1154
01:04:45,202 --> 01:04:47,222
They lack confidence and a sense of security.

1155
01:04:47,222 --> 01:04:50,176
They can be a bit annoying.

1156
01:04:51,343 --> 01:04:53,062
Are you like that?

1157
01:04:53,062 --> 01:04:54,960
- Of course not.
- Who knows?

1158
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,648
- Of course not.
- Who knows?

1159
01:04:55,648 --> 01:04:57,263
Try for yourself.

1160
01:04:57,263 --> 01:04:58,902
What if I try?

1161
01:04:58,902 --> 01:05:00,683
- No way.
- Who knows?

1162
01:05:00,683 --> 01:05:04,083
You dare not even with three jugs of wine.

1163
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:06,143
No one leaves till we finish three jugs.

1164
01:05:06,143 --> 01:05:07,208
Another round.

1165
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:10,140
- Waiter, two more jugs.
- Yes.

1166
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:13,830
♫ I can't rest, can't settle down ♫

1167
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:17,150
♫ I won't stay long in one town ♫

1168
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:20,660
♫ I've been walkin' on all my life  ♫

1169
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:24,260
♫ Every night and every day ♫

1170
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:29,930
♫ Movin' on, groovin' on, and travelin' on in every way ♫

1171
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:34,820
♫ The man I love has got a nice home ♫

1172
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:38,440
♫ But no one can keep me when I've got to go ♫

1173
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,930
♫ I've been walkin' on all my life  ♫

1174
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:45,370
♫ Every night and every day ♫

1175
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:51,480
♫ Movin' on, groovin' on, and walkin' on all my life ♫

1176
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:05,720
♫ Sometimes I hitchhike, the road is my guide ♫

1177
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,860
♫ Sometimes I hope, boy, the train I ride ♫

1178
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:13,550
♫ I've been walkin' on all my life ♫

1179
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:15,770
♫ Every night and every day ♫

♫ Movin' on, groovin' on, and travelin' on in every way ♫

1181
01:06:25,536 --> 01:06:29,022
Tang Ying, you got this.

1182
01:06:37,502 --> 01:06:39,302
Xu Ziquan.

1183
01:06:43,423 --> 01:06:46,024
Xu Ziquan.

1184
01:06:51,243 --> 01:06:53,312
Waiter, bill please.

1185
01:06:56,542 --> 01:06:58,023
Hello, here's your bill.

1186
01:06:58,023 --> 01:06:59,572
Okay.

1187
01:07:00,343 --> 01:07:03,044
It's 2554 yuan in total.

1188
01:07:19,592 --> 01:07:21,576
Thank you.

1189
01:07:36,264 --> 01:07:37,820
Xu Ziquan.

1190
01:07:38,568 --> 01:07:41,463
Xu Ziquan.

1191
01:07:41,463 --> 01:07:43,392
Xu Ziquan.

1192
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,582
Come on.

1193
01:07:45,582 --> 01:07:49,723
Get up. Let's go.

1194
01:07:49,723 --> 01:07:51,196
Let's go.

1195
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:16,952
Aren't you a lawyer? Why did you steal my thing?

1196
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,600
Aren't you a lawyer? Why did you steal my thing?

1197
01:08:19,622 --> 01:08:20,440
You're really something. We're not drinking again. You're too easy.

1198
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:23,652
You're really something. We're not drinking again. You're too easy.

1199
01:08:26,682 --> 01:08:28,013
I think you're fine.

1200
01:08:28,013 --> 01:08:29,916
What are you trying to say?

1201
01:08:30,623 --> 01:08:32,763
The two of us can really be friends.

1202
01:08:32,763 --> 01:08:33,984
The two of us can really be friends.

1203
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:35,772
The two of us can really be friends.

1204
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:39,462
There is no pure friendship

1205
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:42,752
between a man and a woman unless they're both stupid.

1206
01:08:45,443 --> 01:08:47,523
We're not stupid.

1207
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:50,003
So, I know

1208
01:08:50,003 --> 01:08:52,844
I can only be friends with you.

1209
01:08:52,844 --> 01:08:54,268
Why?

1210
01:08:55,062 --> 01:08:57,322
Because I'm clever and sober.

1211
01:08:57,322 --> 01:09:00,043
Because I'm clever and sober.

1212
01:09:00,043 --> 01:09:02,683
I know what I want.

1213
01:09:02,683 --> 01:09:06,483
And I know I won't fall in love with you.

1214
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:10,003
I'm sober, too.

1215
01:09:10,003 --> 01:09:12,962
And I know we're friends.

1216
01:09:12,962 --> 01:09:14,383
You're drunk.

1217
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:15,823
No way. I'm not.

1218
01:09:15,823 --> 01:09:17,632
You're drunk.

1219
01:09:21,102 --> 01:09:23,256
Why don't you believe me?

1220
01:09:30,502 --> 01:09:32,992
W-What are you doing?

1221
01:09:37,823 --> 01:09:39,092
Hello, welcome.

1222
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,403
What are you doing?

1223
01:09:40,403 --> 01:09:42,703
Stop messing around.

1224
01:09:42,703 --> 01:09:45,704
Do you have couples' rings?

1225
01:09:45,704 --> 01:09:47,543
Yeah.

1226
01:09:47,543 --> 01:09:48,883
These are the best-seller.

1227
01:09:48,883 --> 01:09:50,542
Please try them.

1228
01:09:52,443 --> 01:09:54,483
Wait! What do you want?

1229
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,650
♫ You the stair I climb my way without a spoken word ♫

1230
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:07,890

01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:23,082
These are our rings...

1235
01:10:24,743 --> 01:10:26,880
of friendship.

1236
01:10:28,022 --> 01:10:30,252
Wear it and we're good friends.

1237
01:10:30,252 --> 01:10:33,243
Wear it and we're good friends.

1238
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,056
I'll pay.

1239
01:10:36,943 --> 01:10:39,203
No, wait. Stop it. You…

1240
01:10:39,203 --> 01:10:41,044
Sober up.

1241
01:10:43,983 --> 01:10:45,882
Please scan the QR code.

1242
01:10:46,802 --> 01:10:49,032
Excuse me.

1243
01:10:49,032 --> 01:10:51,464
Can we return these tomorrow?

1244
01:10:51,464 --> 01:10:53,302
As long as they are intact for reselling,

1245
01:10:53,302 --> 01:10:55,102
you can refund them with the receipt within 30 days.

1246
01:10:55,102 --> 01:10:56,192
you can refund them with the receipt within 30 days.

1247
01:10:56,192 --> 01:10:59,122
That's good. Thank you.

1248
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:01,032
We can refund them.

1249
01:11:01,032 --> 01:11:02,033
I just paid.

1250
01:11:02,033 --> 01:11:03,304
Thank you.

1251
01:11:03,304 --> 01:11:04,956
Goodbye, sir.

1252
01:11:07,802 --> 01:11:10,360
