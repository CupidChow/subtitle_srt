1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,179
Hello, who is this?

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,080
Are you Liu Jun's wife?

3
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,860
Who is this?

4
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,060
Your husband owes us a lot of money.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,920
Pay us back as soon as possible, or you'll make everyone unhappy in the end.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,892
Hello?

7
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,820
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

8
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,219
You're in a meeting? Sorry.

9
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:12,380
Okay, let's talk later.

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,779
Hello? Mr. Sun, how are you?

11
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,560
Yes, I'm Han Han.

12
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,920
It's been a long time indeed.

13
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,260
What have you been up to recently?

14
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,860
If you're busy with the ball games, can you handle the cases?

15
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,620
If you're not there, won't the clients be anxious?

16
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,460
Okay, no problem.

17
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,879
Divorce cases are fine. I have lots of people here.

18
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:48,239
Leave the urgent cases to me.

19
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,088
Please come in.

20
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,180
Hello, you're Ms. Hao. Right?

21
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,440
I'm Han Han from Junheng Law Firm.

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,132
Pleasure.

23
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,660
Excuse me.

24
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,312
Are you busy?

25
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,080
Yes, there are quite a few cases at hand right now.

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,380
But rest assured, your case will be my priority.

27
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,680
Have you always been a divorce lawyer?

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,899
Well, as you know, the Junheng Law Firm is a large company.

29
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:31,539
We handle both civil and commercial cases, and also divorce cases.

30
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:34,720
Well, you are probably aware of my situation.

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,800
Because right now, I have some debts.

32
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
- Right.
- If I get a divorce…

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,420
Paying back debt is a matter of course.

34
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,800
You can't hide forever, Han Han.

35
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,599
Sorry, a bit of a personal matter. Please continue.

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,939
Well, right now, the child is still young, so if we get a divorce…

37
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,920
How about this? Please review the documents again, and I have some things to do later.

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,620
We can make another appointment.

39
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,019
You can deal with your own matters first.

40
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:16,756
Ms. Hao?

41
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:06,048
[Fake It Till You Make It]

42
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:08,915
[Episode 9]

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,260
Did you tell him you were downstairs at his place?

44
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,179
Of course not.

45
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:16,660
He's out having fun.

46
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,679
If I told him, wouldn't I have lost?

47
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:25,860
True, but it's quite dangerous to date him.

48
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,840
It might be really good when it's good.

49
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,239
But if you're not skilled at this, you won't even know how you lost in the end.

50
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:38,100
But I'm telling you, sis, I don't think you should put all your eggs in one basket.

51
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,740
If you have more options around you, you'll have the upper hand.

52
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,620
Hurry up, it's about to start.

53
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,140
- Wait! Why are you still holding your phone? Phones aren't allowed inside.
- Put it in yours.

54
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,160
You go get the towels and water first.

55
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,248
Okay.

56
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,600
Ying, let's drink your favorite mutton soup tonight.

57
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,040
Do you remember that guy from Palm Bay?

58
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,120
The one who invited you for mutton soup?

59
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,900
- I know, yeah.
- He asked me out.

60
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,000
So he's really rich?

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,460
Super rich.

62
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay. If you're ready, let's start the class.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,440
Discover yourself, awaken happiness,

64
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,120
and impart knowledge.

65
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,219
What's wrong, Hao?

66
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,620
It's nothing. Do your thing.

67
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,899
How is Brother Quan doing with Ms. Xu?

68
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,979
It's going pretty well, almost settled.

69
00:05:57,979 --> 00:05:59,840
That's good.

70
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:03,680
Did he mention what he'll give you after this deal is done?

71
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,459
I really don't know about that.

72
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:07,519
But it's still early for me to get a promotion now.

73
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,360
I should focus on work first,

74
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,759
Bro, do you want to come and work with us?

75
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,079
He didn't invite me, so why would I meddle?

76
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,880
Just do your job. Why are you worrying so much?

77
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,452
Fine.

78
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Give me a summary report later.

79
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,420
Okay.

80
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,419
For the Aroma project, Xu Ziquan's bid is 3.8.

81
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:44,680
Bring your hands to your forehead and thank your body.

82
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,360
Thank you. Thank you all.

83
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,939
That's all for today's class.

84
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:50,040
Class dismissed.

85
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,840
How do you feel after the practice? Isn't it comfortable?

86
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,759
Your shoulder won't hurt anymore after this.

87
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,140
You don't have to massage it all the time.

88
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,800
What are you doing this afternoon?

89
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,360
Going to the company.

90
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,500
What are your plans for tonight?

91
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,260
I think I'll have to work overtime.

92
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,560
Okay, thank you.

93
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,659
Not going for mutton soup anymore?

94
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,600
Should we give your sister a ride? It's on the way.

95
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,068
You had a fight.

96
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:52,380
What do you think of my sister?

97
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,120
What happened between you and your sister?

98
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,900
I just remembered that you approached her first, and it makes me a bit unhappy.

99
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,959
Ma Qiyuan asked her to have mutton soup today.

100
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,620
What does that make me?

101
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,220
Am I just a guinea pig trying out things for her?

102
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,619
I even gave her advice today, saying not to put her eggs in one basket

103
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:17,519
I'm not sure who is the naive one between us.

104
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,720
Now you know there aren't many people in this world who really love you.

105
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,540
I think I know what's going on with you two.

106
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,520
She obviously uses you as a stepping stone.

107
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,180
And what you just said about Ma Qiyuan and the guinea pig, what did you mean?

108
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,380
No, no, wait.

109
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,500
Did you say something bad about my sister?

110
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,180
She's my family, so don't try to provoke a quarrel between us.

111
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm just complaining, but you shouldn't say anything.

112
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
I don't want to explain. I'll go by myself.

113
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,739
Didn't your sister bully you?

114
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,524
Xinzi.

115
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,100
Look! My sister got angry at me just for this.

116
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,876
"OK"?

117
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,480
You have no idea how long I hesitated before sending this message.

118
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,100
What if he gets angry?

119
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,679
What if he tries to sabotage me at work?

120
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,899
What if he wants to invite me again?

121
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,000
What should I do then?

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,660
You're putting on a show inside, but he didn't even bother to reply a word to you.

123
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,200
Just replied with an 'OK'.

124
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,020
It's a clear attitude, up to you.

125
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,420
Yes, that's why it's funny.

126
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,260
When you stick to him, he plays with you.

127
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,399
If you want to leave, whatever.

128
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:32,439
Although there's no relationship between him and me, I did realize something.

129
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:36,780
In the eyes of the rich, young girls are just objects.

130
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,820
Their dictionary doesn't have the word 'love'.

131
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,680
And I'm not suitable for these relationships.

132
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,200
That indeed isn't for everyone.

133
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,620
Many young girls either have the intention but not the guts,

134
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,670
or they have the guts but not the brains.

135
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,530
And then there are ones like you, who have all the essentials but lack determination and courage.

136
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:57,380
And then there are ones like you, who have all the essentials but lack determination and courage.

137
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,540
Who cares? It's good that I don't love him.

138
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,770
Although this might be it for you, personal feelings are one thing, the project is another.

139
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,420
Although this might be it for you, personal feelings are one thing, the project is another.

140
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,140
No, they are absolutely the same thing.

141
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,579
This time, I'm definitely going to involve my personal emotions in work.

142
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,139
They say young girls can't get much money from old men. Right?

143
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:22,240
But we, as the Party B, have a great opportunity to gain benefits from the Party A.

144
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,720
This time, I'm definitely going to use my personal emotions

145
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,920
and work hard, very hard, and make him give me crazy hourly orders.

146
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,260
Right, that's the spirit.

147
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,748
Keep it up.

148
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,600
Do you know how beautiful you are usually?

149
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,419
I snapped a picture while passing by just now.

150
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,120
Director Hu, isn't it inappropriate for you to give me flowers considering you're my superior?

151
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,440
Director Hu, isn't it inappropriate for you to give me flowers considering you're my superior?

152
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,160
You should respect certain boundaries.

153
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,320
You've misunderstood me.

154
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,579
These flowers are not from me.

155
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:26,879
The front desk just brought it in, I saw it and I brought it to you.

156
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:29,079
The front desk just brought it in, I saw it and I brought it to you.

157
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,616
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

158
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:37,240
But, Xinzi, if… if you want, I can send flowers to you.

159
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,459
But, Xinzi, if… if you want, I can send flowers to you.

160
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,200
Thank you, but no, thanks.

161
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,424
Okay…

162
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,840
My dear Xinzi, forgive your sister.

163
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,799
On the matter of hanging out with the rich, I was somewhat unscrupulous.

164
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:12,440
I know I was wrong, so don't be mad at me.

165
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,720
Being angry is bad for your health.

166
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,339
If you forgive me, you can ask me to do anything. Love you.

167
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,400
Love you, muah.

168
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,370
I got the flowers, and I'm not angry anymore.

169
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,240
Love you, too.

170
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,180
I'm glad to know that. Hug.

171
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,564
Come with me for a moment.

172
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,519
What's up?

173
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,620
My mom got hit by an electric bike while she was grocery shopping.

174
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,160
Is it serious?

175
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,599
She's still unconscious in the hospital.

176
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,399
I think I need to go home.

177
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,440
You might have to take over the work here.

178
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,259
It's okay, leave it to me. I'm here, so don't worry.

179
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:06,860
Take care of your mom first.

180
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,640
It's okay.

181
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,620
This is the first time I've seen Wang Yusu lose control of her emotions like this.

182
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,440
No matter how strong one might be, life always finds a way to hit you where it hurts the most, catching you off guard.

183
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,800
No matter how strong one might be, life always finds a way to hit you where it hurts the most, catching you off guard.

184
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,980
No matter how strong one might be, life always finds a way to hit you where it hurts the most, catching you off guard.

185
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,900
Being human is inherently lonely.

186
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,100
Apart from enduring and facing it, what other choices are there?

187
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,240
Ms. Xu.

188
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,879
Ziquan, Ada from your company came to me.

189
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,780
Did she offer you a better price?

190
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,340
Yes, but unfortunately, I am not a savvy businessman.

191
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,620
Yes, but unfortunately, I am not a savvy businessman.

192
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,020
To me, numbers are secondary.

193
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,080
Choosing the right people to work with is what I care about more.

194
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,260
Choosing the right people to work with is what I care about more.

195
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,360
I don't feel comfortable handing over my company to such an unscrupulous team.

196
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,419
I don't feel comfortable handing over my company to such an unscrupulous team.

197
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,319
However, you should find out who leaked the information.

198
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:21,119
I'm very grateful for your trust in me.

199
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:22,919
I believe it's not the first time that this person did this.

200
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,579
I believe it's not the first time that this person did this.

201
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:29,659
But I'll need you to help me stage a play.

202
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,640
I didn't misjudge you. You always have a plan B.

203
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,560
This time you're back, try to keep a low profile.

204
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,739
Be aware of the people around you.

205
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:48,620
Who knows how many eyes are watching,

206
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,939
waiting for the opportunity to completely crush us?

207
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:58,479
Understood. This time, I'll be more cautious.

208
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,879
Miss Han,

209
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:05,979
there's only Tang Ying under Miss Wang.

210
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:08,240
And she has a dozen cases on her hands.

211
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,479
She can't keep up.

212
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:12,780
Could you spare someone to help her out?

213
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:17,900
Mr. Zheng, all of my subordinates are inexperienced youngsters.

214
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,919
If she really can't manage, why don't we work on this case together?

215
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,800
If she really can't manage, why don't we work on this case together?

216
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,540
We've done internal bidding before, and I know it like the back of my hand.

217
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,540
We've done internal bidding before, and I know it like the back of my hand.

218
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,600
Mr. Zheng, the ones we're working on are all medium to long-term projects.

219
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,160
Mr. Zheng, the ones we're working on are all medium to long-term projects.

220
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,360
The most pressing one on our hands is the Wanguo M&A case.

221
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,280
The most pressing one on our hands is the Wanguo M&A case.

222
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,180
And we've done the preliminary work thoroughly.

223
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,880
Rest assured, I can handle it alone.

224
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,420
Rest assured, I can handle it alone.

225
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,460
Tang Ying, it's not that I don't trust you.

226
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,660
Your lack of experience is a fact.

227
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,780
We can't repeat the same mistakes.

228
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,140
Wanguo is a big client, and we can't afford to lose them.

229
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,200
Mr. Zheng, we're on the same page. Don't worry, I…

230
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,520
Miss Tang, Mr. Zheng is right.

231
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,919
You need to see the bigger picture.

232
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,960
Don't always think about gaining credit or showing off when you're young.

233
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,200
Don't always think about gaining credit or showing off when you're young.

234
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,780
Didn't the last Walrus case fall through under your watch?

235
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,940
If things go south again this time, it's not just Miss Wang's heart that will be hurt.

236
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,040
Junheng's reputation is also at stake.

237
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,840
Tang, for the Wanguo case, let Miss Han lead you to handle it.

238
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,060
Tang, for the Wanguo case, let Miss Han lead you to handle it.

239
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,939
I'll take a call. You guys continue discussing.

240
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:20,919
Hello? Okay, I'll be there soon.

241
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,720
Tang Ying, since the meeting has decided that I will lead this project with you.

242
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,980
Tang Ying, since the meeting has decided that I will lead this project with you.

243
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,720
That means you are one of my people now.

244
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,640
As usual, I'll treat everyone to afternoon tea today.

245
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,840
I'm strict with you guys normally, hoping that you'll do better.

246
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,380
I'm strict with you guys normally, hoping that you'll do better.

247
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,840
But in life, I still take good care of you. Right?

248
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,000
But in life, I still take good care of you. Right?

249
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,884
Of course.

250
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,659
I'll add you to the work group.

251
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:46,260
Okay.

252
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,500
Mu, come in.

253
00:16:58,263 --> 00:16:59,780
[Executive Director]

254
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,120
Okay, fine.

255
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,960
How could you mess up this report? How?

256
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,100
Why did it turn out like this?

257
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:24,298
[From Han Han: Who will go downstairs to pick up the takeaway?]

258
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,799
Ziyao, I'll go with you.

259
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,240
Working with Empress Han is quite comfortable.

260
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,559
We get to have afternoon tea.

261
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,559
Do you know that recently, I've been coming to the firm at 8:00in the morning?

262
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,100
Do you know that recently, I've been coming to the firm at 8:00 in the morning?

263
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,700
Why do you come so early?

264
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,460
Empress Han said it was urgent, and I had to be there before 8:00 a.m.

265
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,039
Empress Han said it was urgent, and I had to be there before 8:00 a.m.

266
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,400
Her emergency was to have me turn on her computer.

267
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,379
What?

268
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:03,900
She said her time is very precious, so whenever a project is urgent,

269
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,760
She said her time is very precious, so whenever a project is urgent,

270
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,920
she has me come to the office two hours early and turn on her computer.

271
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,840
she has me come to the office two hours early and turn on her computer.

272
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,859
This way she can save one minute of her time.

273
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,259
She's very controlling.

274
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:19,140
You should be prepared.

275
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,680
I'm telling you! If you ever make it like this again, you shouldn't work with me.

276
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,200
I'm telling you. If you ever make it like this again, you shouldn't work with me

277
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,659
Hurry back to your father.

278
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:26,759
If you don't want to leave, do the case well.

279
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,739
Don't drag our group down.

280
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:30,900
Get out of here.

281
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,176
Get out!

282
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:54,079
Why? What happened?

283
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,859
The boss said the M&A case needs to be redone.

284
00:18:56,859 --> 00:19:00,859
Ms. Xu was dissatisfied with the quote and completely backed out.

285
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:02,160
She said we must think of something by tonight.

286
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,180
She said we must think of something by tonight.

287
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,939
The client is not satisfied with the quote, but why is it your fault?

288
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,519
It's normal for someone not wanting to sell.

289
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,519
I'm helpless, too. I can't help it.

290
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,559
As subordinates, we are actually just punching bags for our superiors.

291
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,760
As subordinates, we are actually just punching bags for our superiors.

292
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,520
It's really frustrating.

293
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,580
You can't think like that.

294
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,000
Work hard and make a stand.

295
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:29,000
If you have anything you don't understand in the future, just ask me.

296
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,900
If you have anything you don't understand in the future, just ask me.

297
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,839
Brother, you're too kind.

298
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,699
If only the boss could be like you.

299
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,379
Do you think it's possible?

300
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,419
What is possible?

301
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:57,259
Nothing, I was distracted, thinking about other things.

302
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:00,419
Just get back to work. It's okay.

303
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,599
- Sorry.
- What are you doing?

304
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,980
So clumsy. Be careful.

305
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,300
Are you all right? Okay, you're welcome.

306
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,559
You, what are you doing? We're at work. What are you doing?

307
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,180
You were quite bold when you harassed me, but now you're scared?

308
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,559
When did I harass you? I was openly pursuing you.

309
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,920
When did I harass you? I was openly pursuing you.

310
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,459
I've said it a thousand times,

311
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,720
I have a boyfriend.

312
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:39,500
Director Hu, or do you have a thing for girls with boyfriends? Isn't that inappropriate?

313
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,720
Director Hu, or do you have a thing for girls with boyfriends? Isn't that inappropriate?

314
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,979
Director Hu, or do you have a thing for girls with boyfriends? Isn't that inappropriate?

315
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,920
Xinzi, I… I… I'm pursuing you because I really like you.

316
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,220
Xinzi, I… I… I'm pursuing you because I really like you.

317
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,000
There are so many beautiful girls in the world.

318
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,419
Why do you have to steal someone else's girlfriend?

319
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,060
Be careful, or you'll trip over yourself.

320
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,560
Xinzi! Xinzi, wait.

321
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,300
Sorry, I'm sorry.

322
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,000
I really can't control myself.

323
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,559
I can't just stand by and watch you walk further into a wrong relationship,

324
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,400
I can't just stand by and watch you walk further into a wrong relationship,

325
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Right? You… I'm headed back now.

326
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,580
Right? You… I'm headed back now.

327
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,720
Can you give me a chance to save you?

328
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,380
- Are you done?
- Yes.

329
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,044
Cheesy.

330
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:19,359
What's up today?

331
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,000
Is it a bit too exaggerated?

332
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,539
Not at all. I love it.

333
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,799
There is a new department head in our company

334
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,119
who keeps saying weird things to me.

335
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,200
And he just happens to be nearby, so I thought I'd show off a bit.

336
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,199
And he just happens to be nearby, so I thought I'd show off a bit.

337
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:33,900
Where is he? He's behind us. He's coming.

338
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,459
Where is he? He's behind us. He's coming.

339
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,039
What a coincidence, Xinzi.

340

your legendary boyfriend who protects you. Right?

342

Look, Xinzi, that's where you went wrong.

What's there to hide about us?

347
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,640
Is your leader always so frivolous?

348
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,219
Absolutely not.

349
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:06,559
I'm not like this with others.

350
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,200

This is not being frivolous,

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,559
it's called "cheesy." Right?

354
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,199
I won't bother you anymore, goodbye.

Darling, when can you give me the background check feedback?

359

Boss, do you want to take a break? I can take over.

367

It's okay. There's not enough time. I can hold on a bit longer.

Ziyao, is there something wrong with Miss Han?

Look! She doesn't read the legal terms but only picks at punctuation.

Look! She doesn't read the legal terms but only picks at punctuation.

Is she a Chinese teacher or a lawyer?

Calm down. Whatever she says is right.

Just accept it all.

377
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,580
She's raping my document.

Rough words, but true.

Both are using violence to declare one's status.

Why are you still not off work?

Didn't you?

No, you must have mentioned it casually to me before.

00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,340
I hope I can stop the loss for Mr. Ma in time

513
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,540
so that he doesn't vent his anger on us.

514
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,300
Mr. Ma, how did it go?

515
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,080
It didn't have a big impact on the company, did it?

516
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,880
You saved the day, and it makes up for the mistake. Right?

517
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,060
That's good.

518
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,900
You're really hungry.

519
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,059
I'm starving.

520
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,440
You like this style?

521
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,039
Why weren't you like this when you were pursuing me?

522
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,479
Why weren't you like this when you were pursuing me?

523
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,140
Well, I just met you.

524
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,679
And I thought people like you...

525
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,599
would all prefer someone gentle, elegant, and considerate.

526
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,140
would all prefer someone gentle, elegant, and considerate.

527
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,160
Who knew you had such a taste?

528
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:58,980
It's almost like you love being the overbearing CEO.

529
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,940
The best thing would be if a young girl just splashes a cup of coffee on you,

530
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,319
The best thing would be if a young girl just splashes a cup of coffee on you,

531
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:06,659
and she would instantly catch your attention. Right?

532
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,400
You know what?

533
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,519
No matter what,

534
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,319
people still prefer authenticity. Right?

535
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:19,419
Are you implying that I wasn't authentic enough before?

536
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:25,360
There's a word that suits you well.

537
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,780
I think it's called twisty.

538
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,200
Actually, for many things, you think too much in your heart

539
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,039
Actually, for many things, you think too much in your heart

540
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,940
when it would be better if you kept things simple.

541
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,180
The world isn't as complicated as you imagine.

542
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,560
But that's okay.

543
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,719
Youth is a process of being twisty.

544
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,819
I was like this twenty years ago.

545
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,120
Didn't you use to say

546
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,420
that you especially liked my upward-striving spirit?

547
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,340
I do like it,

548
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:00,519
but it's more like appreciation...

549
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,880
not being attracted.

550
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,260
What? Are you attracted today?

551
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,720
Are you sure you want to continue this conversation?

552
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,548
No, no.

553
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,160
A couple's ring?

554
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
No wonder you so decisively rejected having mutton soup with me.

555
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,059
No wonder you so decisively rejected having mutton soup with me.

556
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:31,920
So you were already taken.

557
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,599
Let me tell you. Young girls nowadays are very bad.

558
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,159
They all like to have multiple options.

559
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,880
Didn't Jin Yong say the more beautiful a woman is,

560
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,060
the more likely she is to deceive people?

561
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,039
When you think about it, it really makes sense.

562
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:52,760
So, you have to be more vigilant.

563
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,559
With my looks, I'm at this level.

564
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:59,880
And those around you, think about it.

565
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,080
Mr. Ma, I'm going back to the law firm now to get ready.

566
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,640
You can stay here for a while.

567
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,350
Miss Tang, thank you so much for this.

568
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,960
You've worked hard.

569
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,120
I'm just doing my job.

570
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,768
I'll leave then.

571
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,676
I'll take it for the road.

572
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,360
How's it going?

573
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,540
- Boss.
- Boss.

574
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,960
We've basically gone through all the materials.

575
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,900
There's no problem. We can handle the inspection.

576
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,200
Great. I bought coffee and bread.

577
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,440
Eat and then go back to rest soon.

578
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,860
- Thanks, Boss.
- Thank you, Boss.

579
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:09,440
Miss Tang. Miss Tang.

580
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,800
Wake up, Miss Tang.

581
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,840
Miss Tang, something happened.

582
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,199
Something happened with Wanguo.

583
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:19,719
The chairman of Wanguo sent a long email to Mr. Zheng early this morning,

584
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:22,000
The chairman of Wanguo sent a long email to Mr. Zheng early this morning,

585
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,880
accusing Empress Han of being halfhearted and irresponsible.

586
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,619
Mr. Zheng was very angry.

587
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:28,960
This is really…

588
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,340
Also, I don't know why, but Mr. Zheng asked for you.

589
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,900
Also, I don't know why, but Mr. Zheng asked for you.

590
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,759
So, get yourself together.

591
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,056
Got it.

592
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,128
Come in.

593
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,920
Tang, if you didn't save the day by discovering this in time,

594
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,380
Tang, if you didn't save the day by discovering this in time,

595
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,000
our law firm would be culpable.

596
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,100
You stayed up all night yesterday.

597
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,299
You should go home today and get some sleep.

598
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:13,580
For Miss Han…

599
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,960
I'll deal with Miss Han.

600
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,780
Until Miss Wang comes back,

601
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,219
you will independently handle the Wanguo M&A case.

602
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:27,920
Continue to advance according to the plan previously provided to the client.

603
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,679
Continue to advance according to the plan previously provided to the client.

604
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:32,139
All right, I got it.

605
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:33,400
- Mr. Zheng, I'll go back to work then.
- All right.

606
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,752
- Mr. Zheng, I'll go back to work then.
- All right.

607
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,576
Is everything okay?

608
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:04,188
[Xu Ziquan]

609
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,950
Shoot!

610
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,970
I'm so humiliated.

611
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:49,916
[Add to blacklist]

612
00:43:15,544 --> 00:43:16,059
- Hello.
-Don't be angry.

613
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:17,639
- Hello.
-Don't be angry.

614
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,319
I just wanted to say

615
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:20,920
I was very happy to see you at my doorstep.

616
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,860
I was very happy to see you at my doorstep.

617
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,079
Actually, I was also at your doorstep that day.

618
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:26,980
But when I knocked,

619
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,719
there was no one at home, so I thought…

620
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:32,928
Where are you?

621
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,719
The law firm.

622
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:38,559
I've been up all night, and I'm really tired.

623
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,480
Have you finished your work?

624
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,360
How about this? I'll wait for you in the lobby,

625
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,380
and I'll take you somewhere.

626
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,220
Is the video interesting?

627
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,560
I find you quite interesting.

628
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,440
Where are we going?

629
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,800
Where are you taking me?

630
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:17,460
What's going on?

631
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,679
Even if you want to sell me, you should let me know in advance.

632
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:20,480
Even if you want to sell me, you should let me know in advance.

633
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,419
It's quite scary.

634
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:31,024
What is this?

635
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Are we getting a room?

636
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,444
Wait.

637
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,040
What are you doing? Why did you bring me here?

638
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,800
- To sleep.
- To sleep?

639
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,248
Come on.

640
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,200
Let me tell you. Article 237 of the Criminal Law,

641
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,519
Let me tell you. Article 237 of the Criminal Law,

644
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,740
can be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of less than five years.

645
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:11,328
I'm going home.

646
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:16,660
Do you really think I would do something to you?

647
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,820
That's hard to say.

648
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,500
I just think you've been tired lately.

649
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,780
So I booked a room for you to rest well.

650
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,420
Change your clothes. I'll run a bath for you.

651

After you change, you can have a nice bath, and sleep like a baby.

After you change, you can have a nice bath, and sleep like a baby.

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,419
I will close the curtains.

654

All right, you can change now.

Sorry, did I wake you up?

No, I didn't sleep.

- Yes, go change your shoes.

- Are you sure?
- Yes, go change your shoes.

Let's go.

664
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,020
I slept so well.

- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

Are you here to eat?

00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,519
Me too. Do you want to join me?

Your friend is really handsome.

Handsome guy, can you do me a favor and let Ying join me?

681
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:52,039
The thing is, I have something to discuss with her today.

682
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:55,160
So I'll have to say no.

How about this? I'll allow you to have a meal with us.

- All right.
- Wait, Michelle.

00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,750
- All right.
- Wait, Michelle.

689
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,960
Let's go.

690
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,472
Come on.

691
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:19,639
What should we do after dinner?

692
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:24,224
I don't know.

693
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,608
Xu Ziquan.

694
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:32,920
Can you help me decide which of these photos looks good?

695
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,299
I don't really know. You should ask Tang Ying.

696
00:52:35,299 --> 00:52:37,360
Aren't you good at choosing?

697
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,340
Yes, Handsome. Don't be shy.

698
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,739
Are you afraid to look at my selfies?

699
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:48,880
Look at this one. The angle is not very good,

700
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,800
Look at this one. The angle is not very good,

701
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,300
and you're not showing your jawline. Right?

702
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,100
Actually, your jawline is quite pretty.

703
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,020
Next one.

704
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,440
The angle of this one is not bad, but the light is not good.

705
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,320
The angle of this one is not bad, but the light is not good.

706
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,000
So you see, it makes the nasolabial folds a little obvious.

707
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,440
So you see, it makes the nasolabial folds a little obvious.

708
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,519
So annoying.

709
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,120
This one, the direction, smile, and angle

710
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,140
are all perfect. Right? Choose this one.

711
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,340
All right.

712
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:23,579
I've decided.

713
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:25,719
I'll post this one.

714
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:28,860
- Thank you, Handsome.
- You're welcome.

715
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,099
Can I add you on WeChat?

716
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:36,000
Give her my WeChat. She'll give it to you.

717
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,960
Sure, I'll give it to you later.

718
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,800
Thank you.

719
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,104
Try this.

720
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,540
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

721
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,404
I've given it to you.

722
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:03,800
You look so handsome in this photo on your Moments.

723
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,800
You can ride a motorcycle, too.

724
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:10,599
Can you take me for a ride on your motorcycle someday?

725
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:12,579
I would really love that.

726
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:15,748
We'll see.

727
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:29,559
Xu Ziquan, I twisted my ankle. What should I do? I can't walk.

728
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:30,860
Xu Ziquan, I twisted my ankle. What should I do? I can't walk.

729
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:33,659
Are you all right? Hold on.

730
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:35,200
Can you accompany me to the hospital?

731
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,919
How can I accompany you to the hospital?

732
00:54:36,919 --> 00:54:38,239
I really can't even stand.

733
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:39,519
- Wait a minute.
- Take me to the car.

734
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:41,559
- Me? I…
- Look.

735
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:45,499
I really can't walk at all right now. Thank you.

736
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:48,619
Wait for me. I'll be back after taking her to the car.

737
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:13,570
♫ They walk... the streets where thoughts were lost ♫

738
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:22,590

00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:32,850

743
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:02,620
♫ And this the noise a rush cry for rush ♫

744
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:06,420
♫ I need the peace for a moment ♫

745
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:14,420
♫ It's my time I need to feel alive ♫

746
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:18,860
♫ The hearts align their heartbeat ♫

747
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:22,840
Hello?

748
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,699
Miss, there might be a problem with renewing the lease for your house.

749
00:56:25,699 --> 00:56:29,279
It might not be possible to renew it.

750
00:56:29,279 --> 00:56:33,199
What do you think?

751
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,619
What do you mean it's not possible?

752
00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:36,880
Didn't we agree to sign the contract tomorrow?

753
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,199
Didn't we agree to sign the contract tomorrow?

754
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:44,340
The landlord returned to the country a few days ago and said he needed to sell it.

755
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,499
He'd rather bear the penalty than not take back the house.

756
00:56:50,299 --> 00:56:52,619
So what are you saying?

757
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:58,200
It might not be possible to renew the lease,

758
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,779
so…

759
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,260
What do you mean by telling me this now?

760
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,360
It's half a month before my lease expires.

761
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,619
Where do you expect me to find a house?

762
00:57:06,619 --> 00:57:09,300
Are you going to give me a place to stay? How am I supposed to move?

763
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,280
Do you know the principle of "Lease Before Sale"?

764
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,000
I can sue you. I'm a lawyer.

765
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,660
You can look at the contract.

766
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:20,160
We do not guarantee a lease renewal.

767
00:57:27,759 --> 00:57:29,880
No, you can't do this.

768
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,739
We had a verbal agreement, didn't we?

769
00:57:32,739 --> 00:57:34,860
This… I'm really sorry.

770
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,340
We didn't expect this either.

771
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,039
But you still have two weeks. Right?

772
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:39,719
The housing market is good now.

773
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:42,780
I can help find a good house for you.

774
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,260
Can you promise to move out within half a month?

Hello?

800
01:00:40,979 --> 01:00:42,568
Open the door.

801
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,800
Why were you crying?

802
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:02,048
Did you have sex?

803
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:11,800
You didn't reply to my WeChat, and you didn't answer the door.

804
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,280
You were busy tearing this place apart.

805
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,900
Perfect. I don't need to change shoes.

806
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:21,152
What happened?

807
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,500
I just experienced a daily breakdown

808
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:32,019
of a single woman living in the city.

809
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,780
Where's the ring?

810
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:12,519
Move a little?

811
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:13,979
Found it. I found it.

812
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:20,204
Here.

813
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:23,619
You can keep it.

814
01:02:23,619 --> 01:02:27,099
It was originally yours anyway. I'm returning it to its owner.

815
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,599
What do you mean?

816
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,039
Xu Ziquan, let me put it this way.

817
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,079
I've thought about it.

818
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,360
Although we did have some…

819
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,439
Although we did have some…

820
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:45,780
overstepping behaviors recently,

821
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:52,500
I've thought it through.

822
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,840
We should just put this friendship ring back on.

823
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,120
We should just put this friendship ring back on.

824
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,780
Can we take a step back and be friends again?

825
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,300
I'm not very good at dating.

826
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,299
And even worse at playing games.

827
01:03:05,299 --> 01:03:08,459
I will easily get myself trapped in it.

828
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:10,760
Being with a skilled player like you,

829
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,159
I really don't know how I'll end up.

830
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:14,979
I really don't know how I'll end up.

831
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,200
You've thought it through?

832
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,639
Yes, I've thought it through.

833
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:27,040
But I don't want to be your friend at all.

834
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,640
Then what do you want to be?

835
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:32,639
I…

836
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:34,900
Forget it. I didn't say anything.

837
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:42,360
Put it back on. Put it on.

838
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,400
- I won't.
- Put it on.

839
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,699
Why? I won't.

840
01:03:45,699 --> 01:03:48,159
- Put it on.
- You won't be able to open my grip.

841
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:49,940
I won't.

842
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,900
Are you trying to reject me, or seduce me?

843
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,380
Xu Ziquan, I finally understand you.

844
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,719
You, you're truly a scumbag.

845
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:09,039
There are so many girls in the world, and you like every one of them. You never reject anyone.

846
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,080
There are so many girls in the world, and you like every one of them. You never reject anyone.

847
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,739
You don't even like me. What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

848
01:04:11,739 --> 01:04:13,079
You don't even like me. What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

849
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:15,679
What are you doing? What are you trying to do?

850
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:18,599
I-I just wanted to see you.

851
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:20,199
I wanted to talk to you about something.

852
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:23,520
What is it, a confession? Confession is okay.

853
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,159
If it's not a confession,

854
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:26,960
then shut up, I don't want to hear it.

855
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,600
Don't speak ambiguously to me anymore.

856
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,800
Or we can be friends, and stop flirting with me.

857
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,660
Or we can be friends, and stop flirting with me.

858
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,740
I'm telling you! My patience has an expiration date, too.

859
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,739
I'm telling you! My patience has an expiration date, too.

860
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:41,020
So, is your patience with me almost gone?

861
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,519
Yes, it's gone. Tonight.

862
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,840
No more ambiguity. I don't want it.

863
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,979
Even if I really want to play games,

864
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,879
I want someone new to play with. I'm tired of you.

865
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,360
Do you want to get off me?

866
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:21,540
I used to love flirting with girls

867
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,919
and not confirm a relationship with anyone.

868
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,100
Because I'm afraid of trouble, afraid of responsibility,

869
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,120
and afraid of getting hurt myself.

870
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:35,810
You called me scum.

871
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:38,680
You were right.

872
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,820
I said from the beginning...

873
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,220
that I haven't dated for several years.

874
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:50,160
Maybe it's because I'm incapable of love.

875
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:53,679
Because I don't know

876
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:54,880
how to manage and how to establish a healthy relationship.

877
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,199
how to manage and how to establish a healthy relationship.

878
01:05:56,199 --> 01:05:58,619
how to manage and how to establish a healthy relationship.

879
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:16,896
Tang Ying,

880
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:20,520
there are many beautiful girls in Beijing.

881
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,439
Each of them attracts me.

882
01:06:22,439 --> 01:06:23,519
Each one is different and has their own shining points.

883
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:25,800
Each one is different and has their own shining points.

884
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,559
As scum like me, should I seduce them one by one?

885
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:30,340
As scum like me, should I seduce them one by one?

886
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:33,719
But I don't know why, ever since I met you,

887
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:36,800
But I don't know why, ever since I met you,

888
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,079
suddenly I'm not interested in flirting.

889
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,599
Unconsciously, and even consciously, you're all I think about.

890
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,619
Unconsciously, and even consciously, you're all I think about.

891
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,560
I know I have a lot of shortcomings.

892
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,900
I'm slowly learning to become better.

893
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,539
Originally, I was hoping

894
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:11,960
you would give me some time.

895
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,519
But if our expiration date is tonight,

896
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:15,860
But if our expiration date is tonight,

897
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,600
if I must, absolutely, make a choice,

898
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,059
then my answer is…

899
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,579
I really don't know...

900
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,199
if I will mess it up in the future.

901
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:53,359
But it's better than messing it up today. Right?

902
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:00,519
I think the ring should return to its original meaning.

903
01:08:00,519 --> 01:08:05,180
I think the ring should return to its original meaning.

904
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:12,599
It used to be a friendship ring.

905
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:20,360
From now on, a couple's ring. Okay?

906
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:23,352
♫ Never expected before ♫

907
01:08:23,352 --> 01:08:27,077
♫ That there would come a day ♫

908
01:08:27,077 --> 01:08:31,776
♫ When I'm no longer alone in this city ♫

909
01:08:31,776 --> 01:08:34,568

910
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:37,345

♫ Every commuting morning, and every late-night supper ♫

916

♫ The charming trivialities ♫

917
01:08:57,564 --> 01:09:00,160
♫ Now have your company ♫

918
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,873
♫ This is love ♫

919
01:09:05,644 --> 01:09:09,126
♫ I wish to go with you to every city ♫

920
01:09:09,126 --> 01:09:12,409
♫ I wish to go with you to every city ♫

921
01:09:12,409 --> 01:09:17,177
♫ Holding each other in neon lights and moonlight ♫

922
01:09:17,177 --> 01:09:22,633
♫ Every street will be marked ♫

923
01:09:22,633 --> 01:09:26,887
♫ With my love for you ♫

924
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:32,038
♫ The world of the two of us ♫

925
01:09:32,038 --> 01:09:34,910
♫ Unexpected scenes ♫

926
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:39,621
♫ Are the future I see from your eyes ♫

927
01:09:39,621 --> 01:09:42,272
♫ It's only us ♫

928
01:09:42,272 --> 01:09:45,314
♫ Who guessed the right time ♫

929
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:48,980
♫ Without a deadline ♫

930
01:10:13,516 --> 01:10:16,038
♫ The daily grind has never changed ♫

931
01:10:16,038 --> 01:10:20,080
♫ The daily grind has never changed ♫

932
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:24,777
♫ Every commuting morning, and every late-night supper ♫

933
01:10:24,777 --> 01:10:27,888
♫ The charming trivialities ♫

934
01:10:27,888 --> 01:10:30,264
♫ Now have your company ♫

♫ This is love ♫

936
01:10:36,377 --> 01:10:39,631
♫ Every day with you ♫

937
01:10:39,631 --> 01:10:42,706
♫ Is so special ♫

938
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:47,263
♫ No longer afraid to face midnight alone ♫

939
01:10:47,263 --> 01:10:50,048
♫ The most romantic thing ♫

940
01:10:50,048 --> 01:10:52,896
♫ Is to waste time ♫

941
01:10:52,896 --> 01:10:57,231
♫ With you ♫

942
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,849
♫ Each of our days ♫

943
01:11:01,849 --> 01:11:05,285
♫ Is worth commemorating ♫

944
01:11:05,285 --> 01:11:09,888
♫ Until time pieces together every detail ♫

945
01:11:09,888 --> 01:11:12,753

♫ Because of you ♫

947
01:11:15,517 --> 01:11:19,131
♫ We fall in love with every day ♫
