183
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:47,214
And your rhinitis…

184
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:48,674
Who's going to write my retention assessment report if she's gone?

185
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,235
Who's going to write my retention assessment report if she's gone?

186
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:52,534
Who's going to write my retention assessment report if she's gone?

187
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:55,427
Don't worry. Da Wang is a senior employee. She won't be fired.

188
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:56,314
Don't worry. Da Wang is a senior employee. She won't be fired.

189
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:57,334
For example, this is a neutral aroma.

190
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:58,935
For example, this is a neutral aroma.

191
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,647
Try it.

192
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:03,215
- How is it?
- It's very fresh, indeed.

193
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:05,175
- How is it?
- It's very fresh, indeed.

194
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:07,103
It fits my preference.

195
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:08,034
- Would you like to try it?
- All right.

196
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:09,443

- All right.

I'll make a call. Grab my coffee. See you out there.

198
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:15,399
Okay.

199
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:27,735
Miss Tang.

200
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:30,400
Here you go.

201

This is my sweet sister,

214
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:57,754
Tang, let me introduce him to you.

215
00:12:57,754 --> 00:13:00,674
He's my childhood friend Zhang Yiwen,

216
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:02,174
a Ph.D. graduate from MIT.

217
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:03,595
a Ph.D. graduate from MIT.

218
00:13:03,595 --> 00:13:06,155
He's been a lecturer overseas since graduation

219
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:08,415
and just came home because of the talent program.

220
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:10,155
and just came home because of the talent program.

221
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:12,195
He's an associate professor at a university.

222
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:13,354
But it's just for now.

223
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:16,675
He'll definitely be a professor in a few years.

224
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:18,515
You're flattering me.

225
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:20,274
It's a long way to go.

226
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,895
I'll keep working on it.

227
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:24,775
You're really humble, Professor.

228
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:27,114
You're really excellent. Impressive.

229
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:28,325
Zhang Yiwen,

230
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:30,074
Tang may seem slender and frail,

231
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:32,115
Tang may seem slender and frail,

232
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:33,434
but she's truly a model of a contemporary women.

233
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:35,634
but she's truly a model of a contemporary women.

234
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:37,714
She's independent mentally and financially.

235
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:40,614
She's really decisive at work

236
00:13:40,614 --> 00:13:43,714
and has helped me a lot.

237
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:46,635
Yeah, nowadays, women are really tough,

238
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:49,395
building careers and caring for families.

239
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,375
She's not "caring for her family".

240
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,614
Tang is still single.

241
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,155
L-Let me get you some soup.

242
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:57,365
I…

243
00:13:57,365 --> 00:13:59,734
Fine, go ahead.

244
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:02,055
I don't want the oil.

245
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:11,755
You still remember that I like chicken drums?

246
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,415
Thanks.

247
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,275
L-Let me do it.

248
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:26,194
N-No need. I got this.

249
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:27,235
I got this. Thank you.

250
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:28,343
Okay.

251
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:36,214
There are many nice Chinese restaurants these days.

252
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:39,455
I'll take you out for food. And Tang.

253
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:41,135
Here, have some chicken.

254
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,647
Okay.

255
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:47,055
I'll go to the bathroom.

256
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:54,754
Mrs. Meiling,

257
00:14:54,754 --> 00:14:56,674
you brought such a handsome guy here.

258
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:58,995
Why didn't you tell me to dress up?

259
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:01,434
Look at me. I'm in my suit.

260
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,195
It's supposed to be a surprise.

261
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,799
Do you like it?

262
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:07,995
I dare not dislike it.

263
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,515
Tang, listen.

264
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:12,515
Do not take it lightly.

265
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:13,955
Do not take it lightly.

266
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,155
Women's prime years are limited.

267
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:17,955
Women's prime years are limited.

268
00:15:17,955 --> 00:15:19,355
If you don't speed up and find a good husband, you'll be doomed.

269
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:20,554
If you don't speed up and find a good husband, you'll be doomed.

270
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:22,074
If you don't speed up and find a good husband, you'll be doomed.

271
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:23,115
If you don't speed up and find a good husband, you'll be doomed.

272
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:25,355
You'll be diminished.

273
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:26,674
What's the point of having a great career?

274
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:27,574
What's the point of having a great career?

275
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:30,714
If you don't have someone by your side,

276
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:31,954
you'll end up alone in the last years of your life.

277
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:34,014
you'll end up alone in the last years of your life.

278
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:35,775
So sad.

279
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:36,875
You're right.

280
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,174
Of course, I'm right.

281
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:41,655
And you, Zhang Yiwen.

282
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:44,074
Devoted to academic life. Not interested in romance.

283
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:45,614
You're almost 40 but you don't even have a girlfriend.

284
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:48,435
You're almost 40 but you don't even have a girlfriend.

285
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:51,095
It's not really on my mind.

286
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:54,235
Zhang Yiwen, remember?

287
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:55,875
We used to go to the cram school our English teacher set up at home.

288
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,495
We used to go to the cram school our English teacher set up at home.

289

Her grandpa, who loved to listen to the piano, knew fortune-telling.

290
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:02,355
Her grandpa, who loved to listen to the piano, knew fortune-telling.

291
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:03,674
He said that you'd get married late.

292
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:05,035
He said that you'd get married late.

293
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:06,074
And your true love would come once you had a great career.

294
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:07,235
And your true love would come once you had a great career.

295

And your true love would come once you had a great career.

But I haven't found anyone.

297
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:12,395
I guess he wasn't that accurate.

298
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:14,674
What? He was super accurate.

299
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,515
He said that I'd get married at 25.

300
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:18,514
See? Didn't I get married at 25?

301
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:21,155
Didn't he say it'd be an unhappy marriage?

302
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:31,475
Seriously. Not accurate at all. It's hilarious.

303
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:33,339
Not at all.

People say that guys change once they get married.

309
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:46,295
But ever since my husband married me,

310
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:47,794
I think he's been doting on me even more unbridled.

311
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:50,554
I think he's been doting on me even more unbridled.

Let's say we're having a watermelon.

313
00:16:52,314 --> 00:16:55,235
He'd gouge out the center with the spoon

314
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:57,235
and forcefully feed it to me.

315
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:59,355
I didn't even want it.

316
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:00,954
And when we go shopping,

And when we go shopping,

he'd get the bags as long as I cast a glance at them.

319

he'd get the bags as long as I cast a glance at them.

I didn't even ask for those.

Then we lived in two cities due to work.

Then we lived in two cities due to work.

323
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:15,155
And I would get the high-speed train home.

324
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:17,395
It might be really late.

325

But no matter how late it was,

326
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,494
he would always wait for me by the first lamppost of the train station.

327
00:17:21,494 --> 00:17:25,495
he would always wait for me by the first lamppost of the train station.

00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:04,326
I heard that the investment bank was quite sure about acquiring Walrus Technology.

536
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:06,207
I heard that the investment bank was quite sure about acquiring Walrus Technology.

537
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:08,647
So as long as we do our job well,

538
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:11,967
we'll get a lot of work in the future.

539
00:31:13,286 --> 00:31:14,847
Got it.

540
00:31:14,847 --> 00:31:16,707
Tang Ying, I've been paying attention to your performance.

541
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:19,107
Tang Ying, I've been paying attention to your performance.

542
00:31:19,107 --> 00:31:22,586
Tang Ying, I've been paying attention to your performance.

543
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:24,547
I hope you can keep up the good work.

544
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:26,906
I hope you can keep up the good work.

545
00:31:26,906 --> 00:31:28,037
Rest assured, Mr. Zheng. I'll keep doing my best.

546
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:29,687
Rest assured, Mr. Zheng. I'll keep doing my best.

547
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,007
Okay.

548
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:33,887
Jiabai.

549
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:36,479
Xinzi.

550
00:31:39,687 --> 00:31:41,206
Why are you here?

551
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:43,346
I brought you pork belly chicken soup.

552
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:45,067
It's good for the stomach.

553
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:46,926
Have some now.

554
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:57,507
Sit.

555
00:32:12,326 --> 00:32:14,647
Why did you drink so much?

556
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,786
I was a bit upset that day.

557
00:32:17,786 --> 00:32:19,046
I was a bit upset that day.

558
00:32:19,046 --> 00:32:21,286
I thought some drinks might cheer me up.

559
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:23,526
But I got even more upset...

560
00:32:24,687 --> 00:32:26,566
and ended up here.

561
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,327
But I guess it's worth it.

562
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:32,906
You came to see me and brought me soup.

563
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:34,327
It's good.

564
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:39,043
Let me.

565
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:54,507
I've been thinking these days.

566
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:56,466
I've been thinking these days.

567
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:01,906
Sure enough, love can't be forced.

568
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:15,027
So I've decided...

569
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:17,147
to stop pursuing you from now on.

570
00:33:17,147 --> 00:33:19,547
to stop pursuing you from now on.

571
00:34:07,526 --> 00:34:09,166
Wang Yu, help. Why can't I turn on my laptop?

572
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:11,247
Wang Yu, help. Why can't I turn on my laptop?

573
00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:12,806
Really?

574
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:20,467
Is your battery broken?

575
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:23,106
Look, it's swollen.

576
00:34:23,106 --> 00:34:24,997
Is it fixable?

577
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:27,487
They fix laptops in Zhongguancun.

578
00:34:27,487 --> 00:34:29,567
I have a meeting with Walrus this afternoon.

579
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,006
Why don't you use mine first?

580
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:35,006
Never mind. I'll figure something out. Thanks.

581
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:49,767
The two of us can really be friends.

582
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:54,566
Wear it and we're good friends.

583
00:34:59,546 --> 00:35:02,427
Hey, my friend. Help.

584
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:11,407
Hey, my friend. What's wrong?

585
00:35:13,227 --> 00:35:15,207
Don't be so anxious.

586
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:18,066
Of course, I'm anxious. We're having a meeting soon.

587
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:19,607
You said you'd fix it.

588
00:35:19,607 --> 00:35:20,546
I'm not an IT. How can I fix a laptop?

589
00:35:20,546 --> 00:35:22,327
I'm not an IT. How can I fix a laptop?

590
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:23,877
But I can solve your problem.

591
00:35:23,877 --> 00:35:25,727
Here we are.

592
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,227
Here.

593
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,827
Okay, let me inspect it first.

594
00:35:30,827 --> 00:35:33,086
- Okay, thanks.
- Just a second.

595
00:35:34,347 --> 00:35:36,766
Are any important files in there?

596
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:38,767
All in the Cloud.

597
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:41,086
One less reason to be anxious.

598
00:35:41,086 --> 00:35:42,706
It's my production tool.

599
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:45,306
How do I stay calm when it's broken?

600
00:35:45,306 --> 00:35:46,686
You don't know why laborers like us are anxious.

601
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,817
You don't know why laborers like us are anxious.

602
00:35:47,817 --> 00:35:49,907
I'm also a laborer.

603
00:35:49,907 --> 00:35:51,246
And rest assured.

604
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:52,506
I told Ms. Hua that we could delay the meeting a bit.

605
00:35:52,506 --> 00:35:54,207
I told Ms. Hua that we could delay the meeting a bit.

606
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:55,427
No way.

607
00:35:55,427 --> 00:35:57,886
How can I make them wait?

608
00:35:57,886 --> 00:35:59,266
Just relax. Okay?

609
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:02,666
Let's not take ourselves too seriously.

610
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:03,986
We think it's Doomsday.

611
00:36:03,986 --> 00:36:06,397
But others may not notice anything. Right?

612
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:07,875
Relax.

613
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:11,307
Hello, the battery is broken. We can fix it.

614
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:12,927
Great, how long will it take?

615
00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:14,827
About two days.

616
00:36:14,827 --> 00:36:15,616
- Two days?
- Yeah.

617
00:36:15,616 --> 00:36:17,547
- Two days?
- Yeah.

618
00:36:17,547 --> 00:36:19,307
How about this?

619
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:21,307
I'll leave it here and get a new one for now.

620
00:36:21,307 --> 00:36:23,006
All right, which model would you like?

621
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:24,327
X1.

622
00:36:24,327 --> 00:36:27,027
Look at the female elite in CBD.

623
00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:29,576
You got it without asking the price.

624
00:36:29,576 --> 00:36:30,947
Come on! If you have so much to say, why don't you reimburse me?

625
00:36:30,947 --> 00:36:32,046
Come on! If you have so much to say, why don't you reimburse me?

626
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:33,427
Sure, no problem.

627
00:36:33,427 --> 00:36:35,107
I'm the male elite in CBD. Okay?

628
00:36:35,107 --> 00:36:37,026
Hello, there is one left. Will you take it?

629
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:38,667
Yeah.

630
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:47,686
QR code or card, please.

631
00:36:47,686 --> 00:36:49,927
- The code.
- What are you doing?

632
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:52,567
- Reimbursing you.
- Go away. Stop kidding me.

633
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:56,467
You're losing the chance.

634
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:59,487
All right. Shall I open it and set it up for you?

635
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:01,119
Okay.

636
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:04,147
We get double the service for one laptop?

637
00:37:04,147 --> 00:37:06,367
We get double the service for one laptop?

638
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:08,986
He's the salesperson. I'm not.

639
00:37:08,986 --> 00:37:10,826
So you are…

640
00:37:11,726 --> 00:37:13,835
One-on-one tutor.

641
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:19,096
Come on.

642
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:21,186
Your fingerprint, please.

643
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:22,606
Do this. Or this.

644
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:26,007
Do this. Or this.

645
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:28,027
This way, you can turn on the laptop with any finger.

646
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:29,646
This way, you can turn on the laptop with any finger.

647
00:37:29,646 --> 00:37:31,486
It's not necessary.

648
00:37:31,486 --> 00:37:33,036
This one is fine.

649
00:37:33,036 --> 00:37:34,586
Why aren't you wearing it?

650
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,807
What?

651
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:38,406
The friendship ring.

652
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:45,407
Do you know why couples have to wear rings?

653
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:48,087
Do you know why couples have to wear rings?

654
00:37:48,787 --> 00:37:50,166
Why?

655
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:54,227
Because rings represent confinement.

656
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:56,687
Rings are only needed for couples, not for friends.

657
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:58,887
Rings are only needed for couples, not for friends.

658
00:37:58,887 --> 00:37:59,706
Because everyone can have many friends.

659
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:01,767
Because everyone can have many friends.

660
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:04,227
But you're my only female friend.

661
00:38:04,227 --> 00:38:05,827
I have many male friends.

662
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:09,386
Okay, I've set it up. Please take a look.

663
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:14,867
Let's take a selfie.

664
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:16,927
Why?

665
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,567
For work.

666
00:38:19,387 --> 00:38:20,951
Okay.

667
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:33,537
Why would a laptop expert need a photo?

668
00:38:33,537 --> 00:38:35,006
To show that I've been working instead of slacking off.

669
00:38:35,006 --> 00:38:37,026
To show that I've been working instead of slacking off.

670
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:39,587
Do you often slack off?

671
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:41,967
All the time.

672
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:44,467
Otherwise, I wouldn't need a photo.

673
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:46,967
Want her WeChat for some lessons?

674
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:47,977
Want her WeChat for some lessons?

675
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:50,806
No, thanks. It's purely for work.

676
00:38:54,727 --> 00:38:56,423
How funny.

677
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,387
You should have asked for his WeChat.

678
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:00,787
You may become friends.

679
00:39:00,787 --> 00:39:03,466
I don't make friends randomly.

680
00:39:05,586 --> 00:39:07,637
How come you only have one friend?

681
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,867
What are the other girls?

682
00:39:10,706 --> 00:39:13,086
The others... maybe lovers?

683
00:39:13,086 --> 00:39:15,487
The others... maybe lovers?

684
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:25,827
Mr. Xu, I think I've made it really clear.

685
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:27,247
Mr. Xu, I think I've made it really clear.

686
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:28,387
Is it really so hard?

687
00:39:28,387 --> 00:39:29,447
We've talked about this. It's pointless to repeat it.

688
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:30,787
We've talked about this. It's pointless to repeat it.

689
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,186
We sent the charts to that Ally or someone.

690
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:33,807
We sent the charts to that Ally or someone.

691
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:34,927
She said that it'd work with a manager's authorization and the price was fine.

692
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:36,837
She said that it'd work with a manager's authorization and the price was fine.

693
00:39:36,837 --> 00:39:37,847
She said that it'd work with a manager's authorization and the price was fine.

694
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:39,847
We're not raising the question.

695
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:41,787
You're the one raising the question.

696
00:39:41,787 --> 00:39:44,207
Of course, we have to.

697
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:46,587
Okay, Mr. Xu.

698
00:39:47,227 --> 00:39:50,487
Let's call it a day. Okay?

699
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:51,943
Thank you.

700
00:40:06,706 --> 00:40:10,306
Would you like a coffee after work?

701
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:17,055
Sure.

702
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,579
Miss Tang.

703
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:30,026
Article 9 applies here.

704
00:40:35,326 --> 00:40:36,659
Right?

705
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:39,066
Wang Yu.

706
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:41,847
You…

707
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:43,527
Sis, well… I'm just helping Ziyao.

708
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:46,646
Sis, well… I'm just helping Ziyao.

709
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:47,787
I evaluated Walrus and left the report on your desk.

710
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:50,647
I evaluated Walrus and left the report on your desk.

711
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:52,127
Okay.

712
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:54,167
When the sly rabbit dies, the hunting dog is boiled.

713
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:56,327
When the sly rabbit dies, the hunting dog is boiled.

714
00:40:56,327 --> 00:40:57,487
Don't talk nonsense. Who's the dog?

715
00:40:57,487 --> 00:40:59,406
Don't talk nonsense. Who's the dog?

716
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:02,066
Miss Tang, I'm swamped.

717
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:03,647
Miss Tang, I'm swamped.

718
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:05,587
Wang Yu is not so busy, so I got him

719
00:41:05,587 --> 00:41:08,306
to check on a few contracts with me.

720
00:41:08,306 --> 00:41:09,266
Don't be mad.

721
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,847
Yeah, Tang Ying. Wang Yu is just an intern.

722
00:41:10,847 --> 00:41:13,097
Yeah, Tang Ying. Wang Yu is just an intern.

723
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:14,066
What can he do? He's not even barred.

724
00:41:14,066 --> 00:41:15,287
What can he do? He's not even barred.

725
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:17,186
Even Da Wang got kicked out like that, let alone him.

726
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:18,507
Even Da Wang got kicked out like that, let alone him.

727
00:41:18,507 --> 00:41:20,287
- Guo Yu.
- Right?

728
00:41:20,287 --> 00:41:22,047
We're all in this together.

729
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:25,806
It's everyone for himself. Right, Tang Ying?

730
00:41:25,806 --> 00:41:28,957
It's okay, Wang Yu. I was just asking.

731
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:30,567
See you around.

732
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:32,327
I'll leave you to it.

733
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,619
Miss Wang.

734
00:41:48,146 --> 00:41:49,247
This is my last time treating you to coffee.

735
00:41:49,247 --> 00:41:52,787
This is my last time treating you to coffee.

736
00:41:52,787 --> 00:41:54,166
Let me treat you.

737
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:55,711
I have coupons.

738
00:41:56,267 --> 00:41:58,887
I won't come back ever again, anyway.

739
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:01,247
The coupons will be wasted.

740
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:02,871
Let's go.

741
00:42:11,066 --> 00:42:13,887
I won't work at a law firm or legal department again.

742
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,027
I won't work at a law firm or legal department again.

743
00:42:15,027 --> 00:42:17,766
Your coffee.

744
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:19,787
But I can't really take a break and do nothing.

745
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,847
But I can't really take a break and do nothing.

746
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:26,726
I've decided to pursue my dream.

747
00:42:26,726 --> 00:42:29,246
What dream?

748
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,146
I want to be a blogger.

749
00:42:31,146 --> 00:42:33,306
Food blogger.

750
00:42:36,907 --> 00:42:39,007
That suits you.

751
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:41,166
Look.

752
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:43,286
This is my Weibo account.

753
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:48,426
I've uploaded quite a few videos.

754
00:42:48,426 --> 00:42:49,666
And I bought devices for filming vlogs.

755
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:51,147
And I bought devices for filming vlogs.

756
00:42:51,147 --> 00:42:53,476
I'm also studying post-production.

757
00:42:53,476 --> 00:42:55,947
Way to go. You never said anything.

758
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:58,207
But you're already a food blogger.

759
00:42:58,207 --> 00:42:59,667
Yeah, and this.

760
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:01,567
It's been a tough day? It's okay.

761
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:03,167
And a video.

762
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:05,366
It's really good.

763
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:07,706
Actually, I've been making videos since my 30th birthday.

764
00:43:07,706 --> 00:43:10,486
Actually, I've been making videos since my 30th birthday.

765
00:43:10,486 --> 00:43:13,427
Slowly, I gathered some fans.

766
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,827
I did pay to get some fake ones.

767
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:19,606
But later, most of them followed me by themselves.

768
00:43:19,606 --> 00:43:21,666
I may not have many fans,

769
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:26,626
but even splints can be dazzling. Right?

770
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:37,966
Actually, I have diabetes.

771
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:40,786
I really wanted to have the cake you gave me,

772
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:42,407
I really wanted to have the cake you gave me,

773
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:44,506
but I didn't dare to.

774
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:49,167
I thought I'd be fine

775
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,066
as long as I take insulin and slack off work.

776
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:53,086
as long as I take insulin and slack off work.

777
00:43:53,086 --> 00:43:56,247
But I kept getting worse

778
00:43:56,247 --> 00:44:00,106
and ended up in the hospital.

779
00:44:21,586 --> 00:44:24,747
Miss Wang, video meeting in five minutes.

780
00:44:24,747 --> 00:44:26,117
Exhaustion and illness are like the scars of the warriors.

781
00:44:26,117 --> 00:44:28,646
Exhaustion and illness are like the scars of the warriors.

782
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:30,627
Senior white collars would almost

783
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,407
feel embarrassed to be fully healthy.

784
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:34,086
Those scars testify to the past.

785
00:44:34,086 --> 00:44:36,657
The uglier they are, the more dedicated we've been.

786
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:39,307
We work like there's no tomorrow

787
00:44:39,307 --> 00:44:40,186
just to increase our savings as much as possible

788
00:44:40,186 --> 00:44:43,166
just to increase our savings as much as possible

789
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:45,666
and become so-called successful people.

790
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:48,346
and become so-called successful people.

791
00:44:49,347 --> 00:44:51,907
When I was rendered helpless in my sickbed,

792
00:44:51,907 --> 00:44:55,467
When I was rendered helpless in my sickbed,

793
00:44:57,827 --> 00:45:00,046
I suddenly realized that...

794
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:07,875
it wasn't worth it.

795
00:45:09,727 --> 00:45:10,757
It's just… I-It wasn't worth it.

796
00:45:10,757 --> 00:45:14,207
It's just… I-It wasn't worth it.

797
00:45:16,106 --> 00:45:17,706
So, I decided to live for myself

798
00:45:17,706 --> 00:45:18,706
So, I decided to live for myself

799
00:45:18,706 --> 00:45:20,947
So, I decided to live for myself

800
00:45:20,947 --> 00:45:22,507
and do what I like to chase my dream.

801
00:45:22,507 --> 00:45:26,207
and do what I like to chase my dream.

802
00:45:36,747 --> 00:45:38,487
What about you?

803
00:45:38,487 --> 00:45:40,467
Do you really enjoy being a lawyer?

804
00:45:40,467 --> 00:45:42,687
Do you really enjoy being a lawyer?

805
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:48,379
Me?

806
00:45:53,347 --> 00:45:55,687
Do I really want to be a lawyer?

807
00:45:58,066 --> 00:45:59,966
I don't know.

808
00:46:02,307 --> 00:46:03,816
The desire of becoming a lawyer. The stressful life

809
00:46:03,816 --> 00:46:06,127
The desire of becoming a lawyer. The stressful life

810
00:46:06,127 --> 00:46:08,227
filled with overwhelming anxiety as if I'm walking on thin ice.

811
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:10,247
filled with overwhelming anxiety as if I'm walking on thin ice.

812
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:12,747
Which one is more realistic?

813
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:15,467
But I do know that nothing can be more ridiculous than

814
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:17,407
But I do know that nothing can be more ridiculous than

815
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,747
discussing "dreams" in CBD.

816
00:46:19,747 --> 00:46:23,887
Those who have stayed only talk about goals.

817
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:27,066
Five-year goals. Ten-year goals.

818
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:29,686
Weigh the pros and cons.

819
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:33,186
Be practical and rational.

820
00:46:33,186 --> 00:46:37,767
The lunatics who "dream" have long escaped this place.

821
00:46:37,767 --> 00:46:41,786
Da Wang is trying to escape.

822
00:46:59,146 --> 00:47:01,066
Door opened.

823
00:47:01,066 --> 00:47:02,506
Sis, you're so early today.

824
00:47:02,506 --> 00:47:04,707
Sis, you're so early today.

825
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:07,346
Yeah, totally.

826
00:47:11,626 --> 00:47:13,319
Want a drink?

827
00:47:15,947 --> 00:47:17,919
Drinking again?

828
00:47:20,467 --> 00:47:23,546
I always leave during the day

829
00:47:23,546 --> 00:47:26,406
and come back after dark.

830
00:47:29,867 --> 00:47:32,406
Don't I deserve dusk?

831
00:47:33,526 --> 00:47:36,206
Isn't that a line from a Korean drama?

832
00:47:37,907 --> 00:47:42,667
Yeah, but it fits my mood perfectly at this moment.

833
00:47:47,706 --> 00:47:49,847
This guy is fake.

834
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:52,247
Look at the protagonist.

835
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:55,886
The corners of the eyes and the brows all reveal reservation and complacency.

836
00:47:55,886 --> 00:47:59,186
The corners of the eyes and the brows all reveal reservation and complacency.

837
00:47:59,186 --> 00:48:02,666
What kind of elite looks like that in reality?

838
00:48:04,307 --> 00:48:06,447
How's that fake?

839
00:48:06,447 --> 00:48:08,227
That's what we think of elites.

840
00:48:08,227 --> 00:48:10,227
Full of confidence.

841
00:48:11,867 --> 00:48:13,227
You're talking about some newbies who just graduated

842
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:16,166
You're talking about some newbies who just graduated

843
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:19,006
and feel great about themselves.

844
00:48:19,006 --> 00:48:20,887
After some years, they realize that in this metropolis,

845
00:48:20,887 --> 00:48:23,147
After some years, they realize that in this metropolis,

846
00:48:23,147 --> 00:48:24,926
they're just insignificant, ignorant, and childish.

847
00:48:24,926 --> 00:48:27,907
they're just insignificant, ignorant, and childish.

848
00:48:27,907 --> 00:48:29,986
There are too many real elites.

849
00:48:29,986 --> 00:48:32,527
Anyone can be better than them.

850
00:48:33,567 --> 00:48:34,947
The way I see it, a typical elite...

851
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:38,207
The way I see it, a typical elite...

852
00:48:40,106 --> 00:48:42,867
should look exhausted

853
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:49,207
from stress and responsibilities.

854
00:48:51,407 --> 00:48:54,907
What happened today?

855
00:48:54,907 --> 00:48:57,486
Why are you so down?

856
00:48:57,486 --> 00:48:59,987
Nothing. My supervisor got fired.

857
00:48:59,987 --> 00:49:02,047
I'm just a bit emotional.

858
00:49:03,546 --> 00:49:05,967
Go ahead. I'll sit on the balcony.

859
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:06,967
Don't be upset.

860
00:49:06,967 --> 00:49:08,327
I'm here with you.

861
00:49:08,327 --> 00:49:10,227
I'm fine.

862
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,386
Xu Ziquan.

863
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:36,803
Yeah?

864
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:39,986
Do you have a dream?

865
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,195
Of course.

866
00:49:46,307 --> 00:49:48,206
What is it?

867
00:49:52,586 --> 00:49:53,987
Self-actualization.

868
00:49:53,987 --> 00:49:56,699
Contribute to society and mankind

869
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:59,727
instead of simply surviving.

870
00:49:59,727 --> 00:50:01,646
Purely idealistic.

871
00:50:03,646 --> 00:50:05,331
True.

872
00:50:06,327 --> 00:50:10,807
I can tell that you've never been battered by life.

873
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:18,186
That's not true.

874
00:50:18,186 --> 00:50:20,687
Why would you assume that?

875
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:29,927
I just haven't… been battered by women.

876
00:50:39,606 --> 00:50:43,506
Come over here. I'll give you a stab.

877
00:51:06,907 --> 00:51:08,686
I'll go for a shower.

878
00:51:17,947 --> 00:51:19,646
I'm done.

879
00:51:19,646 --> 00:51:21,083
Okay.

880
00:51:27,347 --> 00:51:29,187
I'm downstairs.

881
00:51:40,146 --> 00:51:42,183
Sis, I'll be out for a second.

882
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:45,227
Where are you going at this hour?

883
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,147
A friend came to see me.

884
00:51:47,147 --> 00:51:50,057
I'll say hi and come back.

885
00:51:50,057 --> 00:51:52,446
It's a guy, huh?

886
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:56,675
Xu Ziquan.

887
00:51:57,606 --> 00:52:00,307
Sure, go ahead.

888
00:52:00,307 --> 00:52:03,127
I'll wait for the story.

889
00:52:03,947 --> 00:52:04,787
Don't get us wrong. We're just friends.

890
00:52:04,787 --> 00:52:07,586
Don't get us wrong. We're just friends.

891
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:11,147
Yeah, yeah! Change your mood.

892
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:25,606
Why are you here?

893
00:52:25,606 --> 00:52:27,086
To feed someone.

894
00:52:27,086 --> 00:52:28,627
Me?

895
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:33,187
The cats. Are you a cat?

896
00:52:34,486 --> 00:52:36,666
Come on, Qiuqiu.

897
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:39,446
Look, Qiuqiu.

898
00:52:44,586 --> 00:52:45,966
Food for you.

899
00:52:47,327 --> 00:52:49,606
Orange, come here.

900
00:52:58,227 --> 00:53:00,747
Here's one more. Want it?

901
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:04,547
Go ahead. It's not my favorite.

902
00:53:05,427 --> 00:53:06,835
Fine.

903
00:53:14,467 --> 00:53:15,835
Take it back.

904
00:53:45,706 --> 00:53:47,295
Yours.

905
00:53:48,586 --> 00:53:50,111
Mine.

906
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:58,099
♫ Late night, when you look at me ♫

907
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:00,947
♫ It's like you don't know me ♫

908
00:54:00,947 --> 00:54:03,891
♫ I'm the girl you love before ♫

909
00:54:03,891 --> 00:54:08,019
♫ Baby, you should stick with me ♫

910
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:11,065
♫ I want you to show me ♫

911
00:54:11,065 --> 00:54:12,666
♫ Everything you could have got ♫

912
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:18,825
Did you have a bad day?

913
00:54:18,825 --> 00:54:22,070
♫ Oh, everything ♫

914
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:26,259
♫ Day by day ♫

915
00:54:26,259 --> 00:54:30,353
♫ I lay back about it for now ♫

916
00:54:30,353 --> 00:54:33,922
♫ For now ♫

917
00:54:36,347 --> 00:54:39,067
My legs got numb from squatting.

918
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,626
♫ I don't know how ♫

919
00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:46,007
Tang Ying, are you scared of me?

920
00:54:57,066 --> 00:54:58,847
Every time I try to get closer, you avoid me.

921
00:54:58,847 --> 00:55:03,227
Every time I try to get closer, you avoid me.

922
00:55:06,907 --> 00:55:09,706
Yeah, I am scared of you.

923
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,547
I'm scared of falling in love with you.

924
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:16,767
Because you keep flirting with me.

925
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:18,466
It's dangerous.

926
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,811
I'm also scared.

927
00:55:26,467 --> 00:55:29,063
I'm scared that you'd fall in love with me.

928
00:55:29,066 --> 00:55:31,227
I'm scared that you'd fall in love with me.

929
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,426
Then I won't have any friends.

930
00:55:41,447 --> 00:55:43,231
Xu Ziquan.

931
00:55:45,447 --> 00:55:48,847
I am scared of falling in love with you,

932
00:55:50,887 --> 00:55:53,086
but I'm more worried...

933
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:57,326
that you'll fall in love with me.

934
00:55:59,307 --> 00:56:01,027
Goodnight. Bye.

935
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:08,883
♫ Solace in your light in the twilight ♫

936
00:56:08,883 --> 00:56:11,695
♫ You're the star that guides my way ♫

937
00:56:11,695 --> 00:56:13,683
♫ Without a spoken word ♫

938
00:56:13,683 --> 00:56:16,344
♫ I'm reaching out to you ♫

939
00:56:16,344 --> 00:56:19,219
♫ With every breath I feel ♫

940
00:56:19,219 --> 00:56:23,163
♫ The echoes in your voice ♫

941
00:56:23,163 --> 00:56:25,059
♫ It shines ♫

942
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:27,635
♫ I'm under a spell ♫

943
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:31,411
♫ I'm bound by our love ♫

944
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:35,006
♫ With every step we're intertwined ♫

945
00:56:35,006 --> 00:56:36,383
Tang…

946
00:56:36,383 --> 00:56:39,571
♫ I can not help but ♫

947
00:56:39,571 --> 00:56:45,971
♫ Lost in the words I want to say ♫

948
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:53,647
♫ Together we will chase dreams into the sky ♫

949
00:56:53,647 --> 00:56:58,925
♫ With love as our guide we'll soar and fly ♫

950
00:56:58,925 --> 00:57:04,563
♫ In your love's embrace I've found my bliss ♫

951
00:57:04,563 --> 00:57:08,723
♫ Pure and free ♫

952
00:57:10,475 --> 00:57:16,904
♫ Together we will write our symphony ♫

953
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:21,562
♫ With every breath, I'm enchanted anew ♫

954
00:57:21,562 --> 00:57:27,113
♫ Wrapped in your arms in this magical room ♫

955
00:57:27,113 --> 00:57:31,347
♫ Just you and me ♫

956
00:57:55,403 --> 00:57:58,127
♫ I'm under a spell ♫

957
00:57:58,127 --> 00:58:01,087
♫ I'm bound by our love ♫

958
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,499
♫ With every step we're intertwined ♫

959
00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:07,157
♫ Everything feels right ♫

960
00:58:07,157 --> 00:58:09,683
♫ I can not help but ♫

961
00:58:09,683 --> 00:58:16,017
♫ Lost in the words I want to say ♫

962
00:58:18,219 --> 00:58:24,714
♫ Together we will chase dreams into the sky ♫

963
00:58:24,714 --> 00:58:29,253
♫ With love as our guide, we'll soar and fly ♫

964
00:58:29,253 --> 00:58:34,866
♫ In your love's embrace, I've found my bliss ♫

965
00:58:34,866 --> 00:58:39,360
♫ Pure and free ♫

966
00:58:40,856 --> 00:58:47,155
♫ Together we will write our symphony ♫
