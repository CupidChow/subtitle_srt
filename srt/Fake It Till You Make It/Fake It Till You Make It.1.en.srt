[Fake It Till You Make It]

00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,114
[Episode 1]

3
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:38,518
Airport, thank you.

4
00:01:38,518 --> 00:01:39,892
Okay.

5
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:48,817
Mr. Fang has always been very proactive.

6
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,938
His abrupt change of attitude

7
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:52,118
caught us off guard.

8
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:53,518
I'll have a good talk with him today.

9
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:55,817
Hello, welcome aboard.

10
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:58,508
Hello, welcome, sir.

11
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:06,977
Ladies and gentlemen, hello.

12
00:02:06,977 --> 00:02:09,727
Thank you for choosing Air International.

13
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:11,278
I am not sure when it happened,

14
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:13,067
but the definition of social media is no longer about sharing,

15
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,944
but rather a social business card for this era.

16
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:17,298
Everything you see is entirely the product of my own mind,

17
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:18,464
from the choice of words

18
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:20,096
to the editing of photographs.

19
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,536
Is this considered pretending?

20
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:23,840
But everyone requires a decent appearance.

21
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,858
Even if it differs from one's true self,

22
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:27,552
who cares?

23
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:29,118
Please adjust your seat back to the upright position,

24
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:31,138
fold up the tray table and footrest,

25
00:02:31,138 --> 00:02:32,318
open the window shade,

26
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,718
and fasten your seatbelt.

27
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:36,488
We recommend that you keep your seat belt fastened

28
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:38,768
throughout the flight to avoid unexpected turbulence.

29
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:41,067
Pay close attention to the cabin broadcast

30
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,784
and seat belt signal light instructions.

31
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:45,280
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

32
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:06,577
Kid, please fasten your seat belt.

33
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:09,168
- Ma'am, please fasten your seat belt.
- It's fastened.

34
00:03:09,168 --> 00:03:12,618
Zoe, why are you in economy class today?

35
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:14,977
I'm just covering for a friend.

36
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:18,007
Mr. Xu, there's a cancellation in first class.

37
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:19,957
I can upgrade you.

38
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:21,718
Forget it, I'm on a business trip today.

39
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:22,788
The reimbursement process is inconvenient.

40
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:25,284
Economy class is fine for once.

41
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:27,328
All right, call me if you need anything.

42
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:29,048
Thank you.

43
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:34,852
Zoe.

44
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:38,688
Can you get me a blanket? Thank you.

45
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:51,540
Miss.

46
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:55,738
Don't catch a cold.

47
00:03:55,738 --> 00:03:58,177
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

48
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:03,517
Are you visiting Beijing for business?

49
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:05,398
I am going to Shanghai for business.

50
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:08,508
I thought you were a Shanghai girl.

51
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:12,758
Is this how you usually chat up young girls?

52
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:15,872
- What?
- Ladies and gentlemen,

53
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:17,868
our plane will take off soon.

54
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:20,488
Please cooperate with the cabin crew's safety check,

55
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:21,678
fasten your seat belt,

56
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,808
fold up the tray table,

57
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:23,817
and adjust your seat back to the upright position.

58
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:27,158
You are very caring and good at chatting.

59
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:29,817
I think young girls are quite taken with this.

60
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:33,077
This is the first time anyone has brought up this topic with me,

61
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:35,598
and I have no idea if they are taken with it or not.

62
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:37,518
I just thought of it and asked.

63
00:04:37,518 --> 00:04:39,558
After all, you don't know me.

64
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:42,812
I don't think you're going to get upset with a stranger.

65
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:45,692
Xu Ziquan.

66
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:49,936
Tang Ying.

67
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:55,578
Could you tell me

68
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:57,557
what perfume you are wearing?

69
00:04:58,377 --> 00:04:59,720
Is it orange scent?

70
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,758
Your perfume is also very good.

71
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,320
Bergamot?

72
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,288
Try it.

73
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:11,104
I've already applied it just now.

74
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:13,498
I don't know what it smells like when two perfumes mix.

75
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:15,300
Unexpected results may result

76
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,748
from the blending of two scents.

77
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,960
Thank you.

78
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,744
You're welcome.

79
00:05:54,058 --> 00:05:55,498
Hello, Miss Wang.

80
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:57,678
Ying, have you arrived?

81
00:05:57,678 --> 00:05:59,136
I-I have arrived.

82
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:00,897
Mr. Zheng assigned me some tasks,

83
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:02,278
and I can only go there at night.

84
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,198
You can contact Meiling first.

85
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,858
All right, don't worry.

86
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:07,296
Since I can't be there in person,

87
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:09,797
you will have to speak for our law firm.

88
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:10,938
They are a big,

89
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:11,998
serious company.

90
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:13,548
Don't dress up in a flashy manner,

91
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:16,017
like a dancing clown, do you understand?

92
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:17,198
I understand.

93
00:06:17,198 --> 00:06:19,898
I'm— Hello?

94
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,500
Out of battery?

95
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:32,087
Here you go. Power bank.

96
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:35,536
Thank you. I will return it to you once it's been charged.

97
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:37,858
I've already booked the hotel.

98
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:41,658
Why don't you send me your location

99
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:43,878
and I will go directly to find you?

100
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:54,457
I saw your husband a few days ago in another city,

101
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,977
having dinner with a young girl.

102
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:59,148
How could it be, dear?

103
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:01,558
My husband was with me yesterday.

104
00:07:01,558 --> 00:07:03,838
Look at this bracelet.

105
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:05,577
We bought it together yesterday.

106
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:07,197
I told him not to, but he insisted on buying it for me.

107
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:09,137
You must have seen wrong.

108
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,238
I didn't see it wrong. It was your husband.

109
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:12,998
We had dinner together, so I can recognize him.

110
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:14,738
My husband wouldn't dare.

111
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,408
I'd break his legs.

112
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:19,077
All right, it's not possible.

113
00:07:19,077 --> 00:07:22,058
Look at my husband, such a spendthrift.

114
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:24,798
He insisted on spending so much money to buy me a bag.

115
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:27,388
Why not use that money to buy funds?

116
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:29,600
It's so frustrating.

117
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:33,518
No wonder you're upset.

118
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:35,277
Men don't understand anything.

119
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:36,617
They don't know how to spend money.

120
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:39,477
Add a little more money and get a Hermès.

121
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:43,318
It's a completely different class, isn't it?

122
00:07:43,318 --> 00:07:45,777
I'm telling you, that man was your husband.

123
00:07:45,777 --> 00:07:47,264
Absolutely certain.

124
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:49,472
You really need to be careful.

125
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:52,558
Hey, Miss Tang.

126
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:55,717
I am sorry, but I need to make a business call.

127
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:58,498
We can't always live off men. Right?

128
00:07:58,498 --> 00:07:59,857
Yes, you're right.

129
00:07:59,857 --> 00:08:02,158
You really need to be careful.

130
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:05,758
Miss Tang, yes?

131
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:10,052
We will talk about work at the meeting tomorrow. Okay?

132
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,610
[Zen]

133
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:53,112
Mr. Fang, you'll definitely like it.

134
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,847
You are thoughtful.

135
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:56,967
It's the right thing to do.

136
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,918
Perhaps more than one investment bank has approached you.

137
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:02,778
But please believe in the importance we place on Green Energy.

138
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:04,457
We will do our best

139
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:07,064
to meet all of your needs.

140
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:09,817
We are confident in our ability to facilitate the transaction

141
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,758
between Green Energy and Wanguo.

142
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:13,678
Xu.

143
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,997
You were just meditating.

144
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:19,877
Do you know why the layman hit you with the incense board?

145
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:22,797
The first step in meditation

146
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:26,217
is to let go of the ego.

147
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,296
Yes.

148
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:29,356
I've let go.

149
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:31,524
Have you let go?

150
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:34,358
Seems like I've become quite the mentor.

151
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:36,608
Come on, have some tea.

152
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:57,678
You have a good eye.

153
00:09:57,678 --> 00:09:59,878
This is a limited edition from our designer.

154
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:02,092
Would you like to try it on?

155
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,080
No need.

156
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,058
Does your store have anything similar to the professional attire I'm wearing?

157
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:07,077
Something more formal.

158
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:08,587
I'll find a couple for you, please wait.

159
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:10,364
Okay, thank you.

160
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:16,117
Hello, Miss Wang.

161
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,938
Ying, have you arrived at the hotel?

162
00:10:17,938 --> 00:10:19,597
I've arrived.

163
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:20,697
Have you boarded the plane?

164
00:10:20,697 --> 00:10:21,798
I can't make it.

165
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:23,178
Something came up at home.

166
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:24,477
You will have to

167
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:26,438
take charge of this meeting.

168
00:10:27,776 --> 00:10:28,898
But, Miss Wang,

169
00:10:28,898 --> 00:10:31,788
you are the one who made the legal proposal for contract renewal.

170
00:10:31,788 --> 00:10:32,697
I…

171
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:34,997
You're already thinking about competing for a higher-level merger case.

172
00:10:34,997 --> 00:10:36,538
This is just a contract renewal meeting.

173
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:38,538
What are you panicking about?

174
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,018
Anyway, you must have a backup copy

175
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:42,418
of the legal proposal template on your computer.

176
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:44,217
You can modify the specific details.

177
00:10:44,217 --> 00:10:45,832
I have something to do here, I'll talk to you later.

178
00:10:45,832 --> 00:10:47,176
Goodbye.

179
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:57,596
Miss, do you like these two sets?

180
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:00,968
Don't dress up in a flashy manner,

181
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:03,138
like a dancing clown.

182
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:05,058
I don't want this.

183
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:06,908
I want the designer piece from earlier.

184
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:08,244
Hello?

185
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:10,978
Hey, Richard.

186
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:12,578
I've already met with Mr. Fang.

187
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:15,297
But he still refuses to give a definitive answer.

188
00:11:15,297 --> 00:11:16,817
We may need to talk to him again.

189
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:20,004
Elvis, if you can't reach an agreement with Green Energy,

190
00:11:20,004 --> 00:11:23,717
negotiating with Wanguo will be difficult.

191
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,272
You know what happens...

192
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:28,407
if we don't get this project.

193
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,418
Don't worry.

194
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:31,497
I will continue to follow up.

195
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:34,697
I will also be working on Plan B.

196
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:35,808
I will send someone right away to find out

197
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:38,428
what is going on with Mr. Fang.

198
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:41,084
Don't disappoint me.

199
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,480
Okay.

200
00:12:09,518 --> 00:12:11,308
Mr. Fang of Green Energy has abruptly altered his stance.

201
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:13,538
We need to start a new round of background checks.

202
00:12:13,538 --> 00:12:14,752
Jin Hao. Ma.

203
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:17,808
You should figure out his preferred price.

204
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,572
Mu, find out if there is anyone else behind making decisions.

205
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:26,240
Also, find the breakthrough of Wanguo as soon as possible.

206
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,412
We need to prepare Plan B.

207
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:32,608
Understood.

208
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:37,184
You are the best man at the wedding tomorrow.

209
00:12:37,184 --> 00:12:40,256
Don't stand me up like at today's bachelor party.

210
00:12:41,597 --> 00:12:42,868
Don't worry.

211
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:46,997
How could I stand you up on such a joyous day?

212
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:49,312
See you tomorrow. Have fun.

213
00:12:53,697 --> 00:12:55,537
Hello, sorry to bother you.

214
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:57,058
I need to print some documents.

215
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:59,698
- Is it okay?
- Yes, no problem.

216
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:05,958
- It's in here, just one file.
- Okay.

217
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,584
Okay.

218
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:29,418
- Hello.
- Hello.

219
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:30,688
I'm looking for Mrs. Meiling.

220
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:32,764
I have a meeting scheduled with her today.

221
00:13:32,764 --> 00:13:34,288
Please wait a moment, I'll check on the appointment.

222
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:36,597
Miss Tang.

223
00:13:36,597 --> 00:13:38,097
Mrs. Meiling.

224
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:40,838
You look great today.

225
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:44,448
How you dress here is very different from how you dressed in Beijing.

226
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,658
But it's nowhere near as good as how you dress, Mrs. Meiling.

227
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,398
Your figure is too good.

228
00:13:48,398 --> 00:13:50,568
Really? I look like this every day.

229
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,736
This outfit was bought by my husband.

230
00:13:52,736 --> 00:13:54,578
It's ridiculously expensive.

231
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:55,857
But, after all,

232
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:57,638
nothing good comes without spending money. Right?

233
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:59,232
Of course.

234
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:00,907
The conference room is ready. Let's go.

235
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,620
Okay.

236
00:14:04,497 --> 00:14:06,087
Mrs. Meiling, this is for you.

237
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:07,768
Okay.

238
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:13,098
To begin, on behalf of Mr. Zheng,

239
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:16,864
I would like to express our gratitude and greet everyone.

240
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:19,128
We have been working with the Geer Group for four years.

241
00:14:19,128 --> 00:14:21,258
As a supporting legal team,

242
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:23,840
we feel honored to witness

243
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,428
the Geer Group's continued success.

244
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:31,358
Following that, I will present to you

245
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:33,957
the service plan and content that we will provide

246
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,658
for your company in the coming year.

247
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:38,204
You can also take a look at this document.

248
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:41,037
First, I will discuss business negotiations.

249
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:42,898
We already know that the Geer Group

250
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:45,457
will open more franchise locations in the coming year.

251
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:47,018
So, we will take a companion role

252
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:49,628
in the transaction negotiations,

253
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:52,217
avoiding any risks

254
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:54,588
that may arise during the process.

255
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:57,024
Miss Tang,

256
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:59,418
Miss Wang has been quite busy recently?

257
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:00,977
I see she has a lot of cases.

258
00:15:00,977 --> 00:15:02,798
Is she a little busy?

259
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:06,744
It seems that she's doing well in your firm.

260
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:11,498
Miss Wang is very committed to this contract renewal because—

261
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,890
[How was it?]
[Lu Meiling didn't make things difficult for you, did she?]
[I explained to her, but she didn't respond back to my messages.]

262
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,058
Mrs. Meiling,

263
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,938
Miss Wang really wanted to come today.

264
00:15:26,938 --> 00:15:28,917
She values this meeting very much.

265
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,158
But something happened suddenly last night,

266
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:33,038
and she had to cancel her flight at the last minute.

267
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:35,627
It should have been Miss Wang sitting here now.

268
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:36,737
But you can be sure

269
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:37,828
that I am very committed to this plan.

270
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:39,928
If you are dissatisfied with any of the content,

271
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:41,097
you can tell me at any time.

272
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:42,876
I can make changes.

273
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:47,398
Miss Tang, your work attitude

274
00:15:47,398 --> 00:15:50,327
is far superior to Miss Wang's.

275
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:53,077
With Miss Wang's work attitude,

276
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,617
I…

277
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:55,977
I believe I need

278
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:58,500
to speak with Mr. Zheng.

279
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,178
Mrs. Meiling.

280
00:16:00,178 --> 00:16:02,158
Actually, I believe

281
00:16:02,158 --> 00:16:05,188
that having them fly back and forth for meetings

282
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:06,878
is inefficient.

283
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:08,997
When they are not in the same city as us,

284
00:16:08,997 --> 00:16:11,904
work efficiency suffers immediately.

285
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:21,278
Dear friends and family,

286
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:23,797
I want to say a few words from the heart.

287
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:27,072
And set an example for my two good friends.

288
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:33,380
Shasha, you are my dream, my desire.

289
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,158
Thank you for becoming my love and my only one.

290
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:40,320
I love you, only you.

291
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:42,688
I will love you forever.

292
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:45,438
Well said!

293
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,040
Excellent!

294
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:55,597
Please move your positions a bit further back.

295
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,608
Good, thank you.

296
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:59,017
They are so in love.

297
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,167
Good, let's take another one.

298
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:01,888
You guys, move a little further back.

299
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,818
Longing for marriage?

300
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:05,038
Not really.

301
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:06,658
It's just that every time I go to a wedding,

302
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,297
I feel so moved.

303
00:17:08,297 --> 00:17:12,964
Yes, weddings are indeed moving and beautiful.

304
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:14,788
Just how long can something

305
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:16,878
so beautiful last?

306
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:18,298
Don't be so pessimistic.

307
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,408
Now is forever.

308
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:22,968
Look at what you're saying.

309
00:17:22,968 --> 00:17:25,598
Our law firm always puts clients first.

310
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:26,777
One hundred percent commitment.

311
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:28,737
We'll be here anytime you need us.

312
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:30,037
Transportation is very convenient now.

313
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:31,338
We can fly over quickly.

314
00:17:31,338 --> 00:17:33,120
24 hours on standby.

315
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,056
This is not a problem.

316
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,438
Do you guys have any comments

317
00:17:46,438 --> 00:17:48,937
on this contract?

318
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:52,277
If there are no comments,

319
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:55,137
Miss Tang, you can go back and draft the contract.

320
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:57,272
Okay.

321
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,400
[What's wrong with you?]
[Why aren't you replying?]
[What's the situation now?]
[Take the video!]

322
00:18:22,277 --> 00:18:24,056
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:24,997 --> 00:18:28,668
To attend the meeting in this way.

324
00:18:33,728 --> 00:18:35,498
Miss Wang,

325
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:37,638
you are really dedicated.

326
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:40,456
It's what I should do.

327
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:44,258
- The cooperation with your company—
- What are you doing?

328
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:45,797
W-Wait a minute, aunt.

329
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:47,557
- Now is not the time for this.
- I have a meeting.

330
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:49,517
What successful person are you pretending to be?

331
00:18:49,517 --> 00:18:50,578
Hurry up and kowtow, Yanhong.

332
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:52,896
Hurry up, hurry up.

333
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:55,064
Family members return the courtesy.

334
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,598
Then I'll go kowtow first.

335
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:04,997
My third uncle.

336
00:19:06,197 --> 00:19:11,648
My third uncle who treated me like a father.

337
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:16,197
How could you just leave like this?

338
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:20,897
Your firm's professional demeanor

339
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:24,877
earns people's respect.

340
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:36,098
I am not sure what lucky day it is today

341
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:38,958
to come across something so eye-opening.

342
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:44,517
It is truly late summer, with a chill in the air.

343
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,578
Do you see goosebumps

344
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:48,237
on the back of my neck?

345
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:50,158
Mrs. Meiling,

346
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:54,377
I believe the company's air conditioning is overly powerful.

347
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:56,378
You should prepare a silk scarf in the office.

348
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:58,578
This way you won't catch a cold easily.

349
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:00,298
Of course, I need a silk scarf.

350
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:01,757
But my husband said

351
00:20:01,757 --> 00:20:03,338
that he will make the choice for me.

352
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:05,957
That's good, let's see how his taste is.

353
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:08,398
I'll go back and redraft the contract.

354
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:10,717
Then send it to you to have a look. Okay?

355
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:13,237
The contract renewal is not in a hurry.

356
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:16,078
We may need to have a meeting to discuss this.

357
00:20:16,078 --> 00:20:18,577
So the contract doesn't have to be rushed.

358
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:20,318
Fang, my husband will come over in a while.

359
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:22,468
Let him wait at the front desk. Okay?

360
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:25,357
- But we—
- Honey!

361
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:29,297
- Are you done?
- Why are you here so early?

362
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:30,598
Miss Tang, let me introduce you.

363
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:31,718
This is my husband.

364
00:20:31,718 --> 00:20:33,358
- Hello, Mister.
- Hello.

365
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,488
Mrs. Meiling,

366
00:20:34,488 --> 00:20:37,857
you both are really a perfect match.

367
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:39,678
It's a perfect match.

368
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:42,358
Miss Tang, would you like to join us for dinner

369
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:44,308
if you are not in a hurry to catch a flight?

370
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:47,237
My husband booked a newly opened French restaurant.

371
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:48,918
It's really hard to book.

372
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:51,857
Honey, did it take you weeks to get the booking?

373
00:20:51,857 --> 00:20:55,237
Oh my, Mrs. Meiling. You do a great job at work,

374
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,558
and your husband is so sweet.

375
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:58,858
It's really enviable.

376
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,658
I can't join you.

377
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:02,997
Okay, you go catch your flight then.

378
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:05,108
Honey, will you help me with my bag?

379
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:07,392
But the contract—

380
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,930
[I passed your friend verification request, now we can start chatting]

381
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:17,197
What habit is that?

382
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:19,038
You again, Ziquan.

383
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:21,477
So you have already started chatting with the bridesmaid?

384
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:23,318
But I heard their family has a strong background.

385
00:21:23,318 --> 00:21:25,548
They have deep ties with a big investment bank in Shanghai.

386
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:28,308
Her mother is the group leader of Jinrui Consumer Group.

387
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:29,297
I see there's a chance.

388
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:30,808
She keeps looking back at you every few steps.

389
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:33,137
No, no. Wait.

390
00:21:33,137 --> 00:21:34,497
You have not even finished your wedding yet,

391
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:36,057
and you are already thinking about my affairs?

392
00:21:36,057 --> 00:21:38,978
You should sort out your own first. Okay?

393
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:41,340
- I'm really fed up.
- I'm exhausted.

394
00:21:57,838 --> 00:21:59,838
Hello, Miss Wang?

395
00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:01,557
Has Liu Meiling confirmed the renewal?

396
00:22:01,557 --> 00:22:02,737
There's no problem with the renewal. Right?

397
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:03,838
This is how it is, Miss Wang.

398
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:05,078
Today, they feel that—

399
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:06,717
I don't think she'll be able to find anything wrong with it.

400
00:22:06,717 --> 00:22:08,318
When something so big happened in my family

401
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:10,178
and I still wanted to deal with her,

402
00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:14,557
she would be hard-pressed to find another one like that.

403
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,997
How is it? Have you arrived at the airport?

404
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:20,557
Almost there.

405
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:22,976
I'm sorry for your loss, Miss Wang.

406
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,358
You must take care of your health.

407
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:27,158
When you reach my age, you'll understand.

408
00:22:27,158 --> 00:22:30,078
My mother is heartbroken. She has not been able to eat for several days,

409
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:32,357
and I can't help her.

410
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,778
I'm powerless.

411
00:22:36,237 --> 00:22:38,752
Don't worry, I'll follow up on Geer.

412
00:22:38,752 --> 00:22:40,398
You just take care of yourself,

413
00:22:40,398 --> 00:22:43,344
and take care of your family.

414
00:22:43,344 --> 00:22:46,497
Right. About that performance rating you mentioned earlier,

415
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:47,658
and the recommendation letter,

416
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:48,938
I will write it for you when I get back,

417
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:51,857
and I will definitely say a few nice things about you.

418
00:22:53,477 --> 00:22:55,124
Thank you, Miss Wang.

419
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:57,524
Goodbye.

420
00:22:57,524 --> 00:22:58,900
All right.

421
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,948
I think compared to the French restaurant last time—

422
00:23:29,948 --> 00:23:32,864
Mrs. Meiling.

423
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,708
- Hello.
- Miss Tang, have you been waiting here for a long time?

424
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,100
No, I just arrived.

425
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:42,957
I was on my way to the airport

426
00:23:42,957 --> 00:23:44,958
when I noticed a scarf that you would like.

427
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,078
And I thought since I was here,

428
00:23:46,078 --> 00:23:47,297
I should personally give it to you.

429
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:48,438
Otherwise, it would be a shame.

430
00:23:48,438 --> 00:23:51,438
I just bought the flowers, and they are very fresh.

431
00:23:51,438 --> 00:23:53,797
We have strict rules.

432
00:23:53,797 --> 00:23:55,568
Of course, I can't let you break them.

433
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,708
It's not much money.

434
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:59,217
It's nice to wear it around the office.

435
00:24:01,517 --> 00:24:03,778
Then, how about this?

436
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,978
I'll accept the flowers.

437
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:08,352
But let's forget about the scarf.

438
00:24:08,352 --> 00:24:11,264
Miss Tang, I understand your intentions.

439
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,828
In any case,

440
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:14,900
I would like to give my approval for the renewal.

441
00:24:15,477 --> 00:24:18,118
But you sa it today,

442
00:24:18,118 --> 00:24:20,997
Miss Wang with that look…

443
00:24:20,997 --> 00:24:24,297
Miss Wang is in a unique situation.

444
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,318
I hope you understand.

445
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:29,258
She rarely acts this way.

446
00:24:29,258 --> 00:24:31,418
Then how about this? We can agree on the renewal,

447
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:33,837
but the total price must be reduced by 20%.

448
00:24:34,578 --> 00:24:35,680
20%?

449
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,997
20%…

450
00:24:37,997 --> 00:24:39,737
It's really hard for me to explain to Mr. Zheng.

451
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:42,358
We have such a heavy workload this year.

452
00:24:42,358 --> 00:24:43,678
So, maybe…

453
00:24:43,678 --> 00:24:45,436
10% then.

454
00:24:46,517 --> 00:24:49,557
If you had not tried so hard to find me,

455
00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:52,388
Miss Tang, I would not even talk to you.

456
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:56,358
All right, don't stand here.

457
00:24:56,358 --> 00:24:58,317
Hurry up and catch your flight.

458
00:24:58,658 --> 00:24:59,878
All right.

459
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:02,457
Goodbye, Mrs. Meiling. Goodbye, Mister.

460
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:07,417
Look at these flowers.

461
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:10,216
They are a step down from what you bought.

462
00:25:22,818 --> 00:25:25,128
Hello, welcome aboard.

463
00:25:29,118 --> 00:25:31,264
Let me put this away for you.

464
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:52,870
♫ As she sleeps by the waterside ♫

465
00:25:52,870 --> 00:26:00,930
♫ Dreaming of days gone by ♫

466
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:06,740
♫ Floating up high, weeping willows ♫

467
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:12,070
♫ reflecting the sky ♫

468
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:21,970
♫ She's on the wind, dragonfly ♫

469
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,590
♫ When the leaves slowly wander ♫

470
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:46,100
♫ drifting so quietly on ♫

471
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:50,818
Welcome to Beijing.

472
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,058
Ladies and gentlemen.

473
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:53,297
We have arrived at

474
00:26:53,297 --> 00:26:56,197
Beijing International Airport,

475
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,588
Terminal 3.

476
00:26:57,588 --> 00:26:58,918
The temperature outside is

477
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:01,318
21 Celsius.

478
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:10,620
♫ Only for love, she is lost. A love that's long gone ♫

479
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:21,024
I assumed that becoming a lawyer

480
00:27:21,024 --> 00:27:22,464
and working in the central business district

481
00:27:22,464 --> 00:27:24,898
would allow me to live the life I wanted.

482
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:27,157
But as I got closer, I realized

483
00:27:27,157 --> 00:27:29,817
it was a long way from what I wanted.

484
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:31,538
But it's okay.

485
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:33,472
I won't give up.

486
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:41,997
Unlock is successful. Please open the door.

487
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:55,488
Xinzi?

488
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:56,544
You must be starving?

489
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,318
I ordered you some takeout, so eat first.

490
00:27:58,318 --> 00:28:00,717
Why are you here?

491
00:28:00,717 --> 00:28:01,717
You gave me the password

492
00:28:01,717 --> 00:28:03,938
so I could help you water the plants.

493
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:06,678
That was last year.

494
00:28:06,678 --> 00:28:09,098
I have already watered your plants,

495
00:28:09,098 --> 00:28:10,367
and you have not changed the password.

496
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:12,498
Don't you know? Even if you want to come,

497
00:28:12,498 --> 00:28:13,838
you can call me in advance.

498
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:16,277
Sis, stop scolding me.

499
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,557
If I had somewhere else to go,

500
00:28:17,557 --> 00:28:19,918
I wouldn't bother you.

501
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:21,197
Why don't you have anywhere else to go?

502
00:28:21,197 --> 00:28:22,672
Where's Chen Mo?

503
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:27,220
Don't mention that jerk.

504
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,218
Did you guys fight?

505
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:37,317
I don't fight with jerks.

506
00:28:39,838 --> 00:28:41,697
It's all because of ridicule and mockery.

507
00:28:41,697 --> 00:28:42,678
You have no idea.

508
00:28:42,678 --> 00:28:43,918
Previously, when we were not speaking,

509
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:46,777
he would pamper me within half an hour.

510
00:28:46,777 --> 00:28:48,878
Now I have fled from home,

511
00:28:48,878 --> 00:28:50,857
and he has not even texted me.

512
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:52,858
He doesn't really love me.

513
00:28:57,338 --> 00:29:00,017
Do you think I'm being too dramatic?

514
00:29:04,237 --> 00:29:05,918
You have the right to be dramatic.

515
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:06,944
I think so, too.

516
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,118
I'm not being dramatic for no reason.

517
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:10,438
It is just that when it comes to the matter of principle

518
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:12,058
of whether or not he loves me,

519
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:13,318
I make a big deal out of it with him.

520
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:16,118
I am easygoing most of the time.

521
00:29:16,118 --> 00:29:18,578
But you can always

522
00:29:18,578 --> 00:29:20,657
connect it to a principle.

523
00:29:20,657 --> 00:29:24,257
Sis, why are you still defending him?

524
00:29:24,257 --> 00:29:25,777
I'm just being objective.

525
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:27,937
So what are you going to do now?

526
00:29:27,937 --> 00:29:29,697
It is a contest

527
00:29:29,697 --> 00:29:31,538
of ruthlessness or love to see how long two people

528
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:34,008
can go without talking to each other.

529
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:37,357
Anyway, I think I will have to stay at your house

530
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:39,738
for a few days until there is a winner.

531
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:41,888
I was planning on staying in a hotel,

532
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:43,797
but I am worried my mom will find out.

533
00:29:43,797 --> 00:29:44,958
- Don't tell her.
- Wait.

534
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:46,976
When I'm busy,

535
00:29:46,976 --> 00:29:48,957
I can't take care of you.

536
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:50,558
I can take care of you.

537
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:52,048
Forget it.

538
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:53,557
You can't even take care of yourself,

539
00:29:53,557 --> 00:29:55,517
let alone me.

540
00:29:56,918 --> 00:29:58,218
Then I'll sleep on the sofa.

541
00:29:58,218 --> 00:29:59,758
Get your ass in here and sleep in the room.

542
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:02,438
Okay, I was waiting for you to say that.

543
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,580
[Wang]

544
00:30:45,836 --> 00:30:46,660
Hello, Miss Wang?

545
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,477
I thought you were reliable.

546
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:50,998
I thought I could trust you with this task.

547
00:30:50,998 --> 00:30:52,278
But what happened?

548
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:53,477
Reduced 10%?

549
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,997
You might as well not have gone.

550
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:59,012
Mr. Zheng is very angry, you know?

551
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:00,068
Sorry, Miss Wang.

552
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,237
I wanted to tell you about this,

553
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:03,364
but—

554
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:05,798
Liu Meiling is now pressing me for the contract.

555
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:07,788
Revise the details quickly and send them to me.

556
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:08,978
Okay, I got it.

557
00:31:08,978 --> 00:31:10,318
Did Mrs. Meiling say

558
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:13,928
when the contract deadline is?

559
00:31:13,928 --> 00:31:14,752
I'll fill in the date.

560
00:31:14,752 --> 00:31:16,638
You just focus on the legal terms.

561
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:19,218
Do I need to fill in the contract amount?

562
00:31:19,218 --> 00:31:21,108
That's not your job.

563
00:31:21,108 --> 00:31:23,198
Leave blank the parts I didn't tell you.

564
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:24,737
You do not work hard where it is necessary,

565
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:26,468
and you meddle where it is not.

566
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,997
You have no sense of propriety.

567
00:31:27,997 --> 00:31:29,208
Sorry, Miss Wang.

568
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:30,600
I got it.

569
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,448
By the way, I finished the case report

570
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:33,477
Mr. Zheng assigned to me.

571
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:35,337
He might have some questions in a few places.

572
00:31:35,337 --> 00:31:37,147
I need to explain to you in advance.

573
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:38,798
- It's—
- All right. Let's talk about it tomorrow morning.

574
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:40,200
Everything's coming at once.

575
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,556
I'm sick of it.

576
00:31:42,078 --> 00:31:43,798
Okay, Miss Wang, don't worry.

577
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:46,280
I'll get the contract done right away.

578
00:31:49,898 --> 00:31:51,578
The ease with which I'd tried to create

579
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:54,157
was instantly knocked back in this moment.

580
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,288
Opportunity is not my friend.

581
00:31:57,288 --> 00:31:58,957
The more I desire it,

582
00:31:58,957 --> 00:32:01,257
the more unreasonable it becomes.

583
00:32:01,257 --> 00:32:03,520
I thought I could have a chance to move up

584
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,138
if I could just hold it in the palm of my hand.

585
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:08,288
But it not only vanished without a trace,

586
00:32:08,288 --> 00:32:12,316
but it also struck me hard before fleeing.

587
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,568
Hello, Miss Wang?

588
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:22,918
It's a big mess,

589
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,568
and you are sleeping well?

590
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:26,638
How irresponsible are you?

591
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:27,648
I just got off the plane.

592
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:29,376
Let's apologize via video conference

593
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:30,400
with Liu Meiling later.

594
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,468
Check your email for Liu Meiling's contract feedback.

595
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:40,410
[There are logical errors

596
00:33:52,757 --> 00:33:54,496
That's the way my life is.

597
00:33:54,496 --> 00:33:57,277
It can go wrong at any time.

598
00:33:57,277 --> 00:33:59,298
However, a woman in the central business district

599
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:02,318
must maintain her elegance and poise.

600
00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:15,097
- Good morning, Ziyao.
- Good morning.

601
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:16,338
- Morning.
- Good morning, Miss Tang.

602
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:18,272
Morning, Wang Yu.

603
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:21,896
Tang Ying!

604
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:22,808
Come in quickly.

605
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:24,268
Logical error.

606
00:34:24,268 --> 00:34:26,616
Common sense error.

607
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:30,798
Oh, my gosh.

608
00:34:30,798 --> 00:34:33,598
I was at my uncle's funeral yesterday

609
00:34:33,598 --> 00:34:35,698
and did not thoroughly review the clauses for you.

610
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,068
You have done so well today

611
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:39,198
that you almost got me fired along with you.

612
00:34:39,198 --> 00:34:41,218
How many years have you been working with me?

613
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:43,378
And you still make such basic mistakes.

614
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:45,268
Is the contract being cut by 10%?

615
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:47,658
Can you afford to pay it with your bonus?

616
00:34:50,597 --> 00:34:51,898
Sorry, Miss Wang.

617
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:54,498
Don't give me that.

618
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:02,418
Come on, get ready.

619
00:35:02,418 --> 00:35:03,997
Hello, my dears.

620
00:35:03,997 --> 00:35:07,757
I did not expect to see you online so quickly.

621
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:10,997
Meiling, I wish I could see you every day.

622
00:35:10,997 --> 00:35:13,658
Miss you so much.

623
00:35:14,477 --> 00:35:16,177
Common sense error.

624
00:35:16,177 --> 00:35:18,272
The second clause, the contract expires on

625
00:35:18,272 --> 00:35:20,928
June 31, 2022.

626
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:21,938
I'll fill in the date.

627
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:23,097
You just focus on the legal terms.

628
00:35:23,097 --> 00:35:25,238
May I ask you two mighty attorneys,

629
00:35:25,238 --> 00:35:28,117
who thought this up?

630
00:35:28,117 --> 00:35:29,556
Well.

631
00:35:33,157 --> 00:35:35,328
I'm really sorry, Meiling.

632
00:35:35,328 --> 00:35:38,468
Tang Ying, there's no 31st in June.

633
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:43,358
Y-You. This is really funny, isn't it?

634
00:35:44,157 --> 00:35:46,078
Mrs. Meiling, I'm really sorry.

635
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:48,028
I accidentally

636
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:49,677
got it wrong yesterday.

637
00:35:49,677 --> 00:35:51,348
I'm really sorry, I'll amend it right away.

638
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:53,517
P-Pay attention next time.

639
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:55,577
The second mistake, typo.

640
00:35:55,577 --> 00:35:57,438
Section seven, first clause.

641
00:35:57,438 --> 00:36:00,818
Contract amount: one million and five hundred thousand yuan in total.

642
00:36:00,818 --> 00:36:03,518
May I ask how this yuan

643
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:05,358
is written as yuen?

644
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:07,317
Do I need to fill in the contract amount?

645
00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:08,698
That's not your job.

646
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:09,758
Leave blank the parts

647
00:36:09,758 --> 00:36:11,344
I didn't tell you.

648
00:36:11,344 --> 00:36:14,284
You can see that definitely—

649
00:36:19,008 --> 00:36:20,544
Blame me, Meiling.

650
00:36:20,544 --> 00:36:25,088
I recently got mixed up

651
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:27,698
between yuen and yuan.

652
00:36:27,698 --> 00:36:30,178
Plus, I have been…

653
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:33,077
staying up for several nights in a row lately,

654
00:36:33,077 --> 00:36:35,878
and I am getting…

655
00:36:35,878 --> 00:36:37,157
a bit of a fever.

656
00:36:37,157 --> 00:36:40,418
My nose is still stuffed up.

657
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:43,748
A-About this, Meiling, I'm really sorry.

658
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:46,238
Tang Ying, hu-hurry up and correct it.

659
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:48,197
Give me some feedback. Okay.

660
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:51,338
The contract timing fee

661
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:53,098
is waived for your company this time.

662
00:36:53,098 --> 00:36:54,432
What do you think?

663
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:55,900
Okay, fine. That's all for now.

664
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:05,640
Miss Wang.

665
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,464
Mr. Zheng.

666
00:37:06,464 --> 00:37:08,188
There are several questions

667
00:37:08,188 --> 00:37:10,257
in the report you sent me yesterday.

668
00:37:10,257 --> 00:37:11,157
What I sent you yesterday

669
00:37:11,157 --> 00:37:13,318
was the final report on our previous case.

670
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:14,497
Is there anything unclear?

671
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:16,298
I can make changes at any time.

672
00:37:16,298 --> 00:37:19,257
Look at some of the intellectual property clauses cited here.

673
00:37:19,257 --> 00:37:21,856
Like this one and this, they're not very clear.

674
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:23,724
Explain it to me.

675
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:24,480
Understood.

676
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,758
L-Let Tang explain

677
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:29,208
this detail to you.

678
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:32,318
Tang, come and explain to Mr. Zheng.

679
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:34,418
Only ask me if you do not understand something.

680
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,997
Anytime.

681
00:37:36,997 --> 00:37:40,032
Yes, you hurry up and walk a little faster.

682
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,196
Sit.

683
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:57,308
That was fast.

684
00:37:58,637 --> 00:38:00,968
If Wanguo Group wishes to expand its market in China,

685
00:38:00,968 --> 00:38:03,808
the first step must be to seize territory and occupy the track.

686
00:38:04,557 --> 00:38:07,977
We receive internal information earlier than others.

687
00:38:07,977 --> 00:38:11,338
The previous communication with Green Energy was also very smooth.

688
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:13,316
How come Green Energy Inc. has changed its mind

689
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:15,708
when it comes to you with the project?

690
00:38:17,477 --> 00:38:19,617
Mr. Fang's change of mind happened all of a sudden.

691
00:38:19,617 --> 00:38:21,457
I find it strange, too.

692
00:38:21,457 --> 00:38:23,378
But I already sent someone to look into it.

693
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:24,707
The results should be available today.

694
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:27,737
The pressure from this year's key performance indicators is enormous.

695
00:38:27,737 --> 00:38:29,920
If we cannot reach an agreement with Wanguo,

696
00:38:30,677 --> 00:38:32,952
you can easily imagine the outcome.

697
00:38:36,597 --> 00:38:40,676
Is the percentage of layoffs set?

698
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:44,637
Excluding those who receive global pay,

699
00:38:44,637 --> 00:38:47,420
the remaining 5%...

700
00:38:48,198 --> 00:38:49,597
are not simply laid off.

701
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:51,258
This outcome will also determine

702
00:38:51,258 --> 00:38:53,798
the division of large regions in the second half of the year.

703
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,100
You do not want to be forced to compete with small local investment banks, do you?

704
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:07,960
Elvis,

705
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:14,857
don't let me down.

706
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:19,304
Understood.

707
00:39:19,304 --> 00:39:21,927
I have a meeting tonight with the CFO of Green Energy.

708
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,898
You're coming with me.

709
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,738
How's the investigation into Green Energy going?

710
00:39:37,738 --> 00:39:39,677
Family businesses, tend to be conservative.

711
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,312
They're skeptical about mergers and acquisitions

712
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,278
with large companies like Wanguo.

713
00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:44,640
But as long as the price is right,

714
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,208
everything is negotiable.

715
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:48,092
What are the estimated numbers?

716
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:50,637
I—

717
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:53,768
We have not got the exact numbers yet.

718
00:39:55,398 --> 00:39:58,676
I think they probably don't want to be merged and acquired.

719
00:39:59,912 --> 00:40:01,368
Explain it.

720
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:04,480
The boss is indeed conservative.

721
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,557
But Mr. Fang is the boss's son-in-law.

722
00:40:07,557 --> 00:40:09,378
To get to the top, the younger generation

723
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,900
will have to use different strategies to win over the board.

724
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:14,178
The stock market is a great place to be.

725
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,117
Everyone will get more money.

726
00:40:16,117 --> 00:40:17,952
What can the son-in-law still do

727
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:20,388
if the company is sold to Wanguo?

728
00:40:20,388 --> 00:40:22,238
Who has the upper hand?

729
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:26,492
An assumption. It's Mr. Fang.

730
00:40:31,238 --> 00:40:34,196
Have you contacted Wanguo's boss?

731
00:40:40,328 --> 00:40:41,748
Boss,

732
00:40:42,997 --> 00:40:44,177
Ms. Xin, who is the secretary of Wanguo's board of directors,

733
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:45,184
just got back from a trip abroad yesterday.

734
00:40:45,184 --> 00:40:46,368
If we can get her,

735
00:40:46,368 --> 00:40:49,064
we're 80% there.

736
00:40:49,064 --> 00:40:50,664
Not bad.

737
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:52,037
Jin Hao,

738
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:54,560
- give me a detailed number immediately.
- Okay.

739
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,860
- Niu, follow up on Plan B's Walrus Technology immediately.
- Okay.

740
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,037
- Mu, come with me.
- Okay.

741
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:02,116
What about the secretary?

742
00:41:02,116 --> 00:41:03,904
I'll contact her.

743
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:20,868
All right, Bin Zhi.

744
00:41:20,868 --> 00:41:22,748
See you tonight then.

745
00:41:32,484 --> 00:41:34,878
Making tea yourself?

746
00:41:34,878 --> 00:41:38,338
Drinking water yourself? So humorous.

747
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:40,004
What's making you so happy?

748
00:41:40,004 --> 00:41:41,168
Tell us and share the joy.

749
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:43,657
All right, then you join my team.

750
00:41:43,657 --> 00:41:46,144
I will tell you all and everything I know then.

751
00:41:52,488 --> 00:41:53,840
Sit down.

752
00:41:57,764 --> 00:41:59,618
Go ahead.

753
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:01,777
Wanguo.

754
00:42:01,777 --> 00:42:03,717
It is indeed Wanguo.

755
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,880
They've already made contact with Green Energy.

756
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,704
But they hit a wall.

757
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:12,837
Xu Ziquan is most likely planning his next move.

758
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:17,458
I would like to know more specifics.

759
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:18,798
No one should know. Right?

760
00:42:18,798 --> 00:42:19,837
Don't worry.

761
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,912
No one knows I'm investigating this.

762
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:25,478
Then you inform everyone

763
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:27,758
that we will all be working hard and late today.

764
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:29,358
Make a reservation at a good restaurant for tomorrow,

765
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:31,317
and I will treat everyone to a meal.

766
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:51,018
Hello, Princess Gu.

767
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:54,738
Isn't it?

768
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,997
An old classmate in Shanghai

769
00:42:55,997 --> 00:42:58,418
must have this level of status.

770
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:03,318
By the way, back to the point.

771
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:05,444
How did things turn out with

772
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:07,544
the Green Energy I suggested previously?

773
00:43:26,408 --> 00:43:27,738
Miss Tang,

774
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:30,788
Guo Yu from Miss Han's team has handed in the competition materials.

775
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:32,608
Miss Han gave him a high score.

776
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:35,298
We all think you should try.

777
00:43:35,298 --> 00:43:37,038
Don't let him win.

778
00:43:37,038 --> 00:43:39,972
I am irritated by him flaunting himself.

779
00:43:45,324 --> 00:43:46,280
It's okay.

780
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,677
The deadline has yet to arrive.

781
00:43:47,677 --> 00:43:49,777
There's still time.

782
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:51,438
Thank you.

783
00:43:51,438 --> 00:43:52,638
Then I'll go back first, Miss Tang.

784
00:43:52,638 --> 00:43:55,004
- You should rest early too.
- Goodbye.

785
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:05,704
Sis, are you off work?

786
00:44:05,704 --> 00:44:06,858
Let's go for a drink.

787
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:08,896
Many thanks for allowing me to stay in your home.

788
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,138
You're really making a fuss.

789
00:44:13,138 --> 00:44:15,137
You want me to write a recommendation letter and give you a high score

790
00:44:15,137 --> 00:44:18,378
so you can transfer to Gao Huo's team to work on big cases?

791
00:44:18,378 --> 00:44:20,577
In your dream!

792
00:44:55,008 --> 00:44:56,028
Two martinis.

793
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:58,496
- Okay.
- Thank you.

794
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:04,978
Who's the one who just got off work?

795
00:45:04,978 --> 00:45:06,837
When did you get changed?

796
00:45:07,677 --> 00:45:10,138
Of course, I have to be prepared in my work clothes.

797
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:13,937
You never know when the next opportunity will come.

798
00:45:14,858 --> 00:45:17,057
But when did you go to the gym?

799
00:45:17,057 --> 00:45:19,398
That's a good straight shoulder.

800
00:45:19,398 --> 00:45:21,077
Not everyone is born

801
00:45:21,077 --> 00:45:22,557
with such beauty as you.

802
00:45:22,557 --> 00:45:23,738
People like me

803
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:25,478
can only rely on our own efforts.

804
00:45:25,478 --> 00:45:28,137
Only after I have learned some skills

805
00:45:28,137 --> 00:45:30,748
will I be able to compete with you.

806
00:45:30,748 --> 00:45:33,824
What kind of nonsense are you on about?

807
00:45:47,637 --> 00:45:49,236
Bin Zhi,

808
00:45:50,037 --> 00:45:52,998
I heard Mr. Fang is quite ambitious.

809
00:45:54,457 --> 00:45:57,284
He's not a simple man.

810
00:45:57,284 --> 00:46:00,177
On the surface, he appears to be a noble man,

811
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:04,798
but he's actually an enterprising one.

812
00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:08,457
Is not being enterprising a good thing?

813
00:46:08,457 --> 00:46:10,884
The momentum is certainly good.

814
00:46:10,884 --> 00:46:14,698
But after all, Green Energy isn't owned by the Fangs.

815
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,576
Elvis.

816
00:46:22,057 --> 00:46:24,338
Do you not know Mr. Fang's father-in-law

817
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:26,808
is the key to acquiring Green Energy?

818
00:46:27,517 --> 00:46:30,338
Mr. Fang's father-in-law has a nominee for his shares.

819
00:46:30,338 --> 00:46:31,424
It's hard to find out.

820
00:46:31,424 --> 00:46:33,837
But I've already got someone on it.

821
00:46:35,438 --> 00:46:36,798
Go get two bottles of wine from my car.

822
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:38,324
Okay.

823
00:46:42,528 --> 00:46:44,044
Come on, Mr. Xu.

824
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:45,528
Come on.

825
00:46:52,557 --> 00:46:53,698
Macallan Sherry OAK.

826
00:46:53,698 --> 00:46:55,837
From 2012.

827
00:46:55,837 --> 00:46:57,758
On the rocks.

828
00:46:57,758 --> 00:47:00,700
Let's see if your ice cubes are enticing enough.

829
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,330
- Hi.
- Hi.

830
00:47:39,296 --> 00:47:41,248
I was wondering if I could have the honor

831
00:47:41,248 --> 00:47:43,552
of offering you a glass of whiskey.

832
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:53,477
Offering us a drink?

833
00:47:54,758 --> 00:47:56,758
I have a strong taste.

834
00:47:56,758 --> 00:47:59,558
That's perfect. I'll teach you.

835
00:48:00,597 --> 00:48:02,198
Please serve them each a glass.

836
00:48:02,198 --> 00:48:04,358
I don't need the same as him.

837
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:06,792
Do you have any stronger Macallan?

838
00:48:06,792 --> 00:48:07,637
If not, that's okay.

839
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:10,920
Then give me a glass of 10-year-old Michter's Rye, straight.

840
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,128
- Thank you.
- Okay.

841
00:48:14,668 --> 00:48:16,088
Thank you.

842
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,616
For whiskey,

843
00:48:19,616 --> 00:48:22,304
I prefer a stronger peat flavor.

844
00:48:22,304 --> 00:48:24,258
I used to drink

845
00:48:24,258 --> 00:48:25,658
a lot of island whiskey.

846
00:48:25,658 --> 00:48:28,257
Then I got picky and preferred the original.

847
00:48:28,257 --> 00:48:30,268
Later, I went back to basics.

848
00:48:30,268 --> 00:48:32,497
I think any good-tasting whiskey is worth a try.

849
00:48:32,497 --> 00:48:33,778
Of course, when I first began,

850
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:35,272
I was just like you,

851
00:48:35,272 --> 00:48:37,697
drinking only Macallan 12.

852
00:48:37,697 --> 00:48:38,624
But as I drank more,

853
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:42,717
I discovered that, despite being slightly more expensive,

854
00:48:42,717 --> 00:48:44,677
the layers of Macallan 18

855
00:48:44,677 --> 00:48:46,852
are much richer.

856
00:48:49,184 --> 00:48:51,172
Thank you.

857
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,278
By the way,

858
00:48:55,278 --> 00:48:59,318
only straight is suitable for smelling.

859
00:48:59,318 --> 00:49:01,198
Of course, there is not much to smell

860
00:49:01,198 --> 00:49:02,837
with this beginner whiskey.

861
00:49:02,837 --> 00:49:05,497
But you're still very interesting.

862
00:49:05,497 --> 00:49:07,758
Because I have never seen anyone

863
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:12,517
shaking the ice cubes to smell it.

864
00:49:15,584 --> 00:49:17,777
Isn't your nose

865
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:19,548
cold?

866
00:49:25,452 --> 00:49:26,876
Thank you.

867
00:49:31,117 --> 00:49:32,858
Let's meet again.

868
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:34,144
Goodbye.

869
00:49:34,144 --> 00:49:35,458
Let's play golf next time.

870
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:36,557
Together.

871
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,632
Okay.

872
00:49:37,632 --> 00:49:38,856
Take care.

873
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:40,518
Goodbye.

874
00:49:40,518 --> 00:49:44,017
Richard, are you aware of Green Energy's intention to be listed?

875
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:46,848
Why didn't you find out earlier?

876
00:49:46,848 --> 00:49:48,637
I just found out, too.

877
00:49:51,398 --> 00:49:53,952
Have you contacted the people at Wanguo?

878
00:49:55,198 --> 00:49:56,448
I will contact the secretary

879
00:49:56,448 --> 00:49:58,617
of the Wanguo board as soon as possible.

880
00:49:58,617 --> 00:50:00,438
Plan B must be implemented immediately.

881
00:50:00,438 --> 00:50:03,036
Don't give up on Green Energy completely.

882
00:50:03,036 --> 00:50:04,660
Understood.

883
00:50:06,057 --> 00:50:07,798
I am more concerned with the outcome

884
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:10,200
than with the process.

885
00:50:10,898 --> 00:50:13,536
Don't worry, I'll hurry.

886
00:50:15,798 --> 00:50:19,468
I didn't know you knew so much about whiskey, Sis.

887
00:50:19,468 --> 00:50:20,256
My dear sister,

888
00:50:20,256 --> 00:50:22,218
it really doesn't matter if you understand or not.

889
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:24,258
The secret to pretending

890
00:50:24,258 --> 00:50:25,918
is to speak quickly

891
00:50:25,918 --> 00:50:28,128
and with a lot of professional vocabulary,

892
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:31,178
then express your own special insights

893
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:33,617
to convince him that your knowledge is profound.

894
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:35,587
Once you have completely stopped his momentum,

895
00:50:35,587 --> 00:50:38,158
you have won. Right?

896
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,500
[Wang]

897
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:49,124
Do you want to drink something else?

898
00:50:49,124 --> 00:50:50,698
Me?

899
00:50:50,698 --> 00:50:52,104
Just the same.

900
00:50:52,104 --> 00:50:53,160
Still this one.

901
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,368
I don't understand all that stuff you're talking about.

902
00:50:58,378 --> 00:50:59,567
I've sent you a file.

903
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:02,184
Mr. Zheng is pressing us. Come back and work overtime.

904
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,508
What's wrong?

905
00:51:04,557 --> 00:51:07,300
Who's calling you so late?

906
00:51:09,457 --> 00:51:11,097
I have to go back to work.

907
00:51:11,097 --> 00:51:12,984
Will you come with me?

908
00:51:13,778 --> 00:51:15,857
So sudden.

909
00:51:17,938 --> 00:51:20,397
But I still want to play a bit longer.

910
00:51:20,397 --> 00:51:22,618
Be careful.

911
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:24,938
I'm safe.

912
00:51:24,938 --> 00:51:26,920
You be careful.

913
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,838
Don't worry.

914
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:30,208
- I'm leaving.
- You can do it.

915
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:31,696
Goodbye.

916
00:52:09,577 --> 00:52:10,577
Hello, Miss Wang.

917
00:52:10,577 --> 00:52:11,768
Oh my.

918
00:52:11,768 --> 00:52:14,818
Why didn't you answer my call?

919
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:17,137
I-I'm on my way back to the law firm now.

920
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:18,898
All right, get me a cup of coffee.

921
00:52:18,898 --> 00:52:20,416
Double espresso.

922
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:24,260
All right, I'll be there soon. Okay.

923
00:52:36,617 --> 00:52:38,628
Working overtime?

924
00:52:42,438 --> 00:52:44,438
Being a lawyer is too hard.

925
00:52:44,438 --> 00:52:46,458
I am not going to be a lawyer in my next life.

926
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:47,876
Good evening.

927
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,738
I can't do it anymore, I'm too sleepy.

928
00:52:49,738 --> 00:52:52,017
I've only slept three hours in two days.

929
00:52:52,017 --> 00:52:53,380
What the hack.

930
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,838
I want to go home. I don't want to work anymore.

931
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:57,328
I don't want to go home anymore.

932
00:52:57,328 --> 00:52:59,580
I have to work wherever I am.

933
00:53:01,818 --> 00:53:04,448
Do you know the dumpling stall downstairs is open again?

934
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:07,177
Why do not we go there after work today to eat?

935
00:53:07,177 --> 00:53:08,798
They've created a group.

936
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:10,500
I'll add you.

937
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,920
Okay.

938
00:53:18,368 --> 00:53:20,698
Miss Wang, calm down first.

939
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,378
Here's your coffee.

940
00:53:22,378 --> 00:53:24,288
Apart from buying coffee, what else are you good for?

941
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:29,038
I also bought you a small square cream tart in Shanghai.

942
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:31,318
I'm really panicked now.

943
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:34,597
Cream tart. Do I look like a cream tart?

944
00:53:34,597 --> 00:53:36,480
Cui Ziyao.

945
00:53:37,017 --> 00:53:38,948
Miss Tang, we also added you to the group.

946
00:53:38,948 --> 00:53:40,637
Okay.

947
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:42,838
Look at this group.

948
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:44,157
Old woman. Big sis.

949
00:53:44,157 --> 00:53:45,248
Big bro. Boss.

950
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:46,557
I suspect I could find a master

951
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,878
to fix a bicycle in this group.

952
00:53:48,878 --> 00:53:50,678
Miss Han is pressing us.

953
00:53:51,918 --> 00:53:54,338
Miss Tang, we'll go back to work first.

954
00:53:54,338 --> 00:53:56,238
See you.

955
00:54:18,537 --> 00:54:20,518
Sir, drive slowly.

956
00:54:39,536 --> 00:54:40,224
Hello?

957
00:54:40,224 --> 00:54:41,736
I asked for you.

958
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,637
Jinrui and Green Energy are having a deep conversation.

959
00:54:44,637 --> 00:54:46,637
Is it going public or a merger?

960
00:54:46,637 --> 00:54:48,128
I don't know.

961
00:54:48,128 --> 00:54:50,717
But given that there is no leak,

962
00:54:50,717 --> 00:54:52,138
I believe there must be a problem.

963
00:54:52,138 --> 00:54:54,557
Do you remember Yu Chuanchuan?

964
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:57,258
She's been in a hurry to find a painting these days.

965
00:54:57,258 --> 00:54:59,177
At Christie's in Hong Kong.

966
00:54:59,177 --> 00:55:00,898
You're not paying attention to it.

967
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:03,204
Am I able to pay attention to it?

968
00:55:03,204 --> 00:55:04,260
You forgot.

969
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,418
Yu Chuanchuan is from Jinrui.

970
00:55:06,418 --> 00:55:07,557
If you go to Yu Chuanchuan,

971
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:10,820
you might know what Green Energy's next move is.

972
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,924
You could also know if you have a chance.

973
00:55:18,097 --> 00:55:19,264
Miss Wang.

974
00:55:19,264 --> 00:55:20,752
Come in.

975
00:55:21,577 --> 00:55:24,598
Why are you so slow?

976
00:55:26,017 --> 00:55:29,137
Have you looked at the materials for the cross-border merger case?

977
00:55:29,137 --> 00:55:31,917
Translate it all; all of it.

978
00:55:40,177 --> 00:55:42,178
It's because there are no beans in the coffee machine,

979
00:55:42,178 --> 00:55:44,636
that's why the coffee is so slow.

980
00:55:45,457 --> 00:55:48,017
I've also looked at the materials for the cross-border merger case.

981
00:55:48,017 --> 00:55:49,138
There's too much.

982
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:51,552
Miss Wang, there's no use being in a hurry.

983
00:55:51,552 --> 00:55:53,948
You can't finish it in one night.

984
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,728
W-What do you mean?

985
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,597
What I mean is,

986
00:55:58,597 --> 00:56:01,698
I would like to take part in this cross-border merger case

987
00:56:01,698 --> 00:56:04,778
as a formal lawyer.

988
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,858
I've given you the proposal.

989
00:56:05,858 --> 00:56:07,558
I also went to the law firm competition.

990
00:56:07,558 --> 00:56:09,077
Miss Han gave Guo Yu,

991
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:11,744
who is not even an intellectual property lawyer,

992
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:13,996
high marks, how about you?

993
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:14,858
What are you doing?

994
00:56:14,858 --> 00:56:15,838
Suppressing me every day.

995
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:17,117
Discouraging me from going out.

996
00:56:17,117 --> 00:56:18,577
Also, exploiting my spare time.

997
00:56:18,577 --> 00:56:20,218
Not letting me rest, making me translate for you.

998
00:56:20,218 --> 00:56:21,278
If it's translated well, all the credit goes to you.

999
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:23,258
If it's not translated well, it's all my fault. Right?

1000
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:25,177
Why should I?

1001
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:26,627
Big sis,

1002
00:56:26,627 --> 00:56:29,218
Liu Meiling's contract was reduced by 10%.

1003
00:56:29,218 --> 00:56:31,858
- I want to be with you...
- What 10%?

1004
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:32,858
Stop that.

1005
00:56:32,858 --> 00:56:34,418
I'm very tired now, I need to rest.

1006
00:56:34,418 --> 00:56:35,658
I need to sleep.

1007
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:36,657
I'm the one who does all the miscellaneous tasks.

1008
00:56:36,657 --> 00:56:37,657
I'm the one who takes the blame.

1009
00:56:37,657 --> 00:56:38,898
I don't even get the credit.

1010
00:56:38,898 --> 00:56:40,398
You just want to work me to death, don't you?

1011
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:42,858
I have been working extra hours for several days now.

1012
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:43,936
I can't take it anymore.

1013
00:56:43,936 --> 00:56:45,238
Even animals don't live like this.

1014
00:56:45,238 --> 00:56:47,568
Animals also need to eat, sleep, and drink water.

1015
00:56:47,568 --> 00:56:49,128
I'm telling you, tonight,

1016
00:56:49,128 --> 00:56:50,178
I need to rest.

1017
00:56:50,178 --> 00:56:51,838
You'd better rest early, too.

1018
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:52,938
Do you know what time it is now?

1019
00:56:52,938 --> 00:56:53,952
Still drinking coffee?

1020
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,318
Be careful, it might kill you.

1021
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,696
Say something.

1022
00:57:08,804 --> 00:57:10,292
All right.

1023
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,152
Um…

1024
00:57:18,497 --> 00:57:20,558
You take it home and do it.

1025
00:57:24,418 --> 00:57:26,712
T-Thank you, Miss Wang.

1026
00:57:28,036 --> 00:57:29,592
Go ahead.

1027
00:58:10,037 --> 00:58:12,377
We consider ourselves human.

1028
00:58:12,377 --> 00:58:14,596
However, in the central business district's office buildings,

1029
00:58:14,596 --> 00:58:16,458
we are frequently

1030
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:19,738
treated as a tool.

1031
00:58:19,738 --> 00:58:22,698
It's a tacit approval of the times and society.

1032
00:58:22,698 --> 00:58:26,412
One of the millions of small gears in operation.

1033
00:58:26,412 --> 00:58:27,637
Expensive,

1034
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:30,176
yet cheap labor.

1035
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:35,350
[On the 6th night of this year, I can only sleep for more than 3 hours a day. When I wake up in the morning, I don't even have time to get dizzy and I have to wash up. My mind is full of terms and cases. I used to have heart palpitations]

1036
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:39,160
[when I drank coffee, but now I have a cup in the morning, afternoon, and evening. A new round of physical and mental challenges has begun. Believe that if you persist all the way, you will be able to live forever. Thanks to my partners.]

1037
