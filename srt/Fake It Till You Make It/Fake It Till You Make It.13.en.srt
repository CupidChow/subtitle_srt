[Episode 13]

3
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:54,140
Sister, are you okay?

4
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,779
Why are you alone? Where's Xu Ziquan?

5
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:58,060
I didn't tell him.

6
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,999
Why didn't you tell him?

7
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:03,139
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

8
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:04,919
At first, I just felt a bit of pain in my chest.

9
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:06,900
At first, I just felt a bit of pain in my chest.

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,980
It used to hurt only when I pressed it, but now it hurts whenever I move.

11
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,800
It used to hurt only when I pressed it, but now it hurts whenever I move.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,760
So I wanted to come to the hospital for a check-up, just to ease my mind.

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,020
So I wanted to come to the hospital for a check-up, just to ease my mind.

14
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,759
But then the ultrasound results came out yesterday.

15
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,760
The report showed a lump with unclear margins.

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,560
The report showed a lump with unclear margins.

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,139
Then the doctor told me...

18
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,660
that it was highly likely to be malignant, and suggested that I get an MRI.

19
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,259
that it was highly likely to be malignant, and suggested that I get an MRI.

20
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,259
I just checked on the internet, and it seems like

21
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,580
I just checked on the internet, and it seems like...

22
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,440
I might not make it.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,359
Sis, stop scaring yourself by looking things up on the internet.

24
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,580
Sis, stop scaring yourself by looking things up on the internet.

25
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,239
The doctor is only suspecting, and it's not a definite diagnosis yet.

26
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,820
The doctor is only suspecting, and it's not a definite diagnosis yet.

27
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,259
Let's just do the checkup first.

28
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,619
But what if it's true?

29
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,920
What if it's really true?

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,859
I've only just found my love.

31
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,400
My career has just started.

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,479
I still have so many possibilities in my future. I still want to...

33
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,880
With today's advanced medical technology, the success rate of conservative treatment is high.

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,600
With today's advanced medical technology, the success rate of conservative treatment is high.

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,499
Besides, can we stop overthinking? All right?

36
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:20,940
Besides, can we stop overthinking? All right?

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,440
Let's just do the check-up first, and wait for the results.

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,580
Let's just do the check-up first, and wait for the results.

39
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,859
It's okay, really.

40
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,499
Sis, why didn't you tell Xu Ziquan?

41
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:52,100
It could be a big deal.

42
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,439
If I'm really sick,

43
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:58,679
should I drag him in to carry it with me?

44
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,579
Would that be too selfish?

45
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,479
But what if he wants to carry it with you?

46
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,540
You didn't give him the chance.

47
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,159
Isn't that unfair to him?

48
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,920
I don't want to think too much anymore. I'm so tired.

49
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,680
I don't have the time to think either.

50
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,319
How have you two been recently?

51
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,559
We've been good. Always good.

52
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,780
Then, what's wrong?

53
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:36,619
I just feel that he's too independent,

54
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,519
like he doesn't need me.

55
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,679
On the surface, he seems to treat you well, cares about you, and takes care of you,

56
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,039
On the surface, he seems to treat you well, cares about you, and takes care of you,

57
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,719
But he's actually a closed loop.

58
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,260
I can't get in at all.

59
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,520
Xu Ziquan, do you actually not want to come out and play with me?

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,759
Xu Ziquan, do you actually not want to come out and play with me?

61
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,059
Xu Ziquan, do you actually not want to come out and play with me?

62
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:59,260
No.

63
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,159
Isn't it nice to come out and play?

64
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,060
Why do I feel like you have not been in a very good state recently?

65
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,980
Why do I feel like you have not been in a very good state recently?

66
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:17,820
Really?

67
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,780
Is it because I haven't spent much time with you?

68
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,940
Or is it because I've been complaining to you about work?

69
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,959
Or is it because I've been complaining to you about work?

70
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,040
Or is it because I've been complaining to you about work?

71
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,639
Or is there something upsetting you at work?

72
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,779
Or is there something upsetting you at work?

73
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,659
Nothing.

74
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,000
You know my job. It's quite boring. Right?

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,879
You know my job. It's quite boring. Right?

76
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,959
It's fine, actually.

77
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,680
If there's anything that upsets you, you can talk to me.

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,879
If there's anything that upsets you, you can talk to me.

79
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,720
After all, we are now two people.

80
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,120
If two people are together, they should share and bear things together.

81
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
If two people are together, they should share and bear things together.

82
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,260
If two people are together, they should share and bear things together.

83
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,759
You know, since I was little,

84
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,140
I'm not used to sharing any unhappiness with other people.

85
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,760
I'm not used to sharing any unhappiness with other people.

86
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,920
I'm not used to sharing any unhappiness with other people.

87
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,020
It feels so negative.

88
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,420
But I'm not just other people.

89
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,244
No, I…

90
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,720
Honestly, I'm quite tired of this guessing game.

91
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,079
Honestly, I'm quite tired of this guessing game.

92
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,640
But men and women are different in this aspect.

93
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,920
Look at us. When we're unhappy, we vent to each other, complain a bit, and then it's over.

94
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,439
Look at us. When we're unhappy, we vent to each other, complain a bit, and then it's over.

95
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,039
Look at us. When we're unhappy, we vent to each other, complain a bit, and then it's over.

96
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,560
But what about men? When they're under stress, they tend to hide.

97
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,300
But what about men? When they're under stress, they tend to hide.

98
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,539
But what about men? When they're under stress, they tend to hide.

99
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,019
How did you become a love master?

100
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:30,719
Well, I have a wealth of experience.

101
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,684
That's true.

102
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,480
But I used to think in fairy tales, when the prince and princess

103
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,220
But I used to think in fairy tales, when the prince and princess

104
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,340
get to live happily ever after, that's truly the end.

105
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,560
get to live happily ever after, that's truly the end.

106
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,880
But now, I think the ending is just the beginning of the test.

107
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,879
But now, I think the ending is just the beginning of the test.

108
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,580
But now, I think the ending is just the beginning of the test.

109
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,339
Think about it. With Xu Jiabai,

110
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:53,600
it was only after we got to know each other that we realized we were not right for each other.

111
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,240
it was only after we got to know each other that we realized we were not right for each other.

112
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,380
Are we right for each other?

113
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,720
We overcame many obstacles to be together, yet we can't even confirm if we're right for each other.

114
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,960
We overcame many obstacles to be together, yet we can't even confirm if we're right for each other.

115
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,919
Stop sleeping. Get up.

116
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,880
Get up. Look at this.

117
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,600
Look at how well you've set up the tent.

118
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,759
I didn't expect you to be so capable.

119
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,920
- Right? I told you.
- You really set it up.

120
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,020
My practice is always worth trusting.

121
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,399
So trustworthy.

122
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,960
- I'm impatient.
- Perfect.

123
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,079
Xu Ziquan is patient.

124
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,440
Whatever I do, I always follow the plan strictly.

125
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,339
Whatever I do, I always follow the plan strictly.

126
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:33,300
But he believes all roads lead to Rome and is not bothered by details.

127
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,800
But he believes all roads lead to Rome and is not bothered by details.

128
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,219
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

129
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:38,180
Our tent collapsed.

130
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,200
Have you encountered this before?

131
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,920
Why don't I go take a look for you?

132
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,020
That'd be great. Thank you.

133
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,700
Duo, come and help Daddy.

134
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,199
Give this skewer to Daddy. Okay?

135
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,440
- Okay, son, come on.
- Let's go.

136
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
Come on, come over here.

137
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,120
Look at this meat. Look.

138
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,899
- How long does it take for two people to reach this level of understanding?
- We'll eat this later.

139
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:54,900
- How long does it take for two people to reach this level of understanding?
- We'll eat this later.

140
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,860
It's easy to say I love you.

141
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,360
The hard part is to persist without being worn down by trivial matters.

142
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,559
The hard part is to persist without being worn down by trivial matters.

143
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:07,160
Tang Ying. Are you Tang Ying?

144
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,620
Sis.

145
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,040
Come with me.

146
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,520
Miss, can I accompany her inside?

147
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,920
Family members should wait outside.

148
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,520
Come on, follow me.

149
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,339
It's okay, relax.

150
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:18,339
Wait for me here.

151
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,940
Relax, relax! I'll wait for you outside.

152
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,340
Okay.

153
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,000
What's wrong? Thinking about Richard?

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,240
No.

155
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,360
Then, why the long face?

156
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,419
Just a camping trip. Is it that tiring?

157
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,420
I meant well, right?

158
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,600
I thought since we're all on vacation, I'd take her out for some fun.

159
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,720
I thought since we're all on vacation, I'd take her out for some fun.

160
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,259
But she didn't appreciate it at all.

161
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:53,159
What is she focused on?

162
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,219
Setting up the tent, barbecuing,

163
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,360
and she thought I was clumsy.

164
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,212
Have a skewer.

165
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,280
It's from our neighbor.

166
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,000
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,160
Mine is almost cooked, too.

168
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,960
Are you sure about that?

169
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,360
- The color looks fresh.
- Wait a minute, bro.

170
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,259
It was like this when I went out.

171
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,600
It's still like this when I came back. It needs more time.

172
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,560
It's simple. I'll just cook it a bit more.

173
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,852
Wait.

174
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,519
Oh dear, you keep grilling.

175
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,700
I'm going to eat there for a while.

176
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,879
Wait a minute here.

177
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:42,740
So there are times when you can't handle it, huh?

178
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,340
I'm more capable than you.

179
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,460
Don't be so sensitive. I meant things you're not good at.

180
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,400
Don't be so sensitive. I meant things you're not good at.

181
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,360
All right? Not good at.

182
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,860
Let me tell you.

183
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,299
We're both so busy normally that we don't see each other much.

184
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:57,319
We're both so busy normally that we don't see each other much.

185
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,240
I took her to the creek to watch the stars.

186
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,659
How romantic. But what happened?

187
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:04,899
Look, I'll show you.

188
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:07,739
Look! The Summer Triangle is about to appear.

189
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:08,999
You see?

190
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:12,260
Look! The brightest star now is Polaris.

191
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,480
In a while, it will rotate and fall onto the horizon.

192
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,620
In a while, it will rotate and fall onto the horizon.

193
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,159
Then comes Vega, Altair, and Deneb.

194
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,600
Then comes Vega, Altair, and Deneb.

195
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,759
You see, it's good that we didn't go to sleep in the tent. Otherwise, we would have missed it.

196
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,850
You see, it's good that we didn't go to sleep in the tent. Otherwise, we would have missed it.

197
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,800
What are you doing?

198
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,699
I'm replying to an email. Wait a minute.

199
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,360
Can't you reply later?

200
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,759
Look! It'll be gone in a moment.

201
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,419
I'll be quick. Five minutes.

202
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:36,819
- It's so bright.
- I-I'm in a hurry.

203
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,600
Well, it's gone.

204
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,216
All right.

205
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:52,039
Baby, what was the star you mentioned?

206
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,719
Where-Where is it?

207
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,559
It went down.

208
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,659
It went down?

209
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,760
As a married person and a bystander, let me comment a bit.

210
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,800
As a married person and a bystander, let me comment a bit.

211
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,260
Tang Ying is now, in a period of career rise.

212
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,360
And work can get to your head, as you're well aware.

213
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,480
And work can get to your head, as you're well aware.

214
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,120
Especially when you've had some achievements.

215
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,819
If she doesn't push now, when should she?

216
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:15,920
Then naturally, the time left for you will be less.

217
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,559
Then naturally, the time left for you will be less.

218
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,879
Either you try to understand wholeheartedly,

219
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:28,459
or you two should have an honest talk.

220
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:32,860
I know this look you're having now.

221
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,480
It's the look of a man completely in love.

222
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,308
Red light.

223
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,600
How is it? Is the result out?

224
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,640
How is it? Say something.

225
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,299
The doctor said this lump

226
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:59,399
was benign and nothing to worry about.

227
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,720
I just need to check up every half a year.

228
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,080
In fact, it's just two regular lumps stacked together.

229
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,279
So it looked like an irregular large lump on the ultrasound.

230
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,000
So it looked like an irregular large lump on the ultrasound.

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,168
Everything's fine.

232
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:09,799
Don't worry. That scared me.

233
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,960
Don't worry. That scared me.

234
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,140
Thank goodness you were here.

235
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,279
Of course, I am your sister.

236
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,799
If you're not feeling well, can I feel well?

237
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:21,280
But you must tell Xu Ziquan when you go back.

238
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,140
It's all good now, so why bother?

239
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,740
You still have to tell him.

240
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,519
Being together is about experiencing life.

241
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,960
Keeping secrets from each other will only turn into hidden dangers.

242
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,700
Keeping secrets from each other will only turn into hidden dangers.

243
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,980
All right then, I'll think about it.

244
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,440
But let's think about what we're going to eat first. Let's have a good meal to celebrate.

245
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,699
But let's think about what we're going to eat first. Let's have a good meal to celebrate.

246
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:39,519
- Hotpot.
- Let's go! You can order anything you want.

247
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,819
- Hotpot.
- Let's go! You can order anything you want.

248
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:43,939
Sis, do you feel all right now?

249
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:45,500
I feel more than all right.

250
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,160
Having hotpot, it's a total relief.

251
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,540
But earlier, before you came,

252
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,720
when I was sitting there alone waiting for the results,

253
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,979
when I was sitting there alone waiting for the results,

254
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:58,459
my mind was filled with a million things.

255
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:00,179
I was thinking about myself,

256
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:05,072
my dad, my mom, and thinking about you.

257
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,519
Thinking about what happened in the past and thinking about my future.

258
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,880
What am I going to do in the future?

259
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,760
If you ask me, you're just worn out.

260
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,339
Holding that computer all day,

261
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,060
you don't know for how long you're working overtime.

262
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,960
Just think about the hair in your bathroom.

263
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,279
If you don't care about your health, at least consider your beauty.

264
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,080
If you don't care about your health, at least consider your beauty.

265
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,980
I feel like if you keep going like this,

266
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,880
what if the nodule gets bigger and bigger?

267
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,159
Actually, on the way here, I've been thinking about it the whole time.

268
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,840
Actually, on the way here, I've been thinking about it the whole time.

269
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,120
Today's result was good, and that's nice.

270
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,639
But what if it's not?

271
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,699
Yeah.

272
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:40,279
I work hard, and I strive to make money.

273
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,000
Isn't it just to prove myself?

274
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
If I'm gone, who am I proving myself to?

275
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,579
If I'm gone, who am I proving myself to?

276
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:48,600
You've finally woken up.

277
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,759
Really, I told myself on the way here,

278
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,020
that whoever wants to work overtime can work overtime.

279
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,820
Not me.

280
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,720
You remember what you're saying now.

281
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,860
No more overtime. Let's have a drink.

282
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,360
I'll remember to live in the moment.

283
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,539
- Exactly.
- Right?

284
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,059
Hello, Mr. Xie.

285
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,620
When will the document be ready?

286
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,700
I've prepared it. Don't worry.

287
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,000
You have to give it to me. I need it right now.

288
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,519
You have to give it to me. I need it right now.

289
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,279
Don't delay my work.

290
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
Could you please wait for me for ten minutes?

291
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,360
Because I'm outside, busy with something else.

292
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,660
I need to go back to the law firm to send it to you.

293
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,600
The contract is on the computer.

294
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,900
All right then, you hurry up.

295
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,080
Okay, rest assured.

296
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,040
I'll send it right away. Okay.

297
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,240
Oh my god.

298
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,120
So what we said just now was for nothing.

299
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,399
Don't tell me you can't even eat this hotpot.

300
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,740
Don't tell me you can't even eat this hotpot.

301
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,219
Who said no more overtime?

302
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:44,960
No, Sis, this isn't overtime.

303
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,280
I just need to send a contract to someone.

304
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,200
Did you hear how urgent it was?

305
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,879
You can't be too selfish.

306
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,360
Besides, well, I'll come back. You eat first.

307
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,059
Besides, well, I'll come back. You eat first.

308
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,240
You'll come back? No way.

309
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,219
- Rest assured.
- That's bullshit.

310
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,779
Alice, answer the door.

311
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,919
- Who are you?
- Are you Alice?

312
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,140
- Who are you?
- Are you Alice?

313
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,800
- We two are your daddy's colleagues.
- Where's Daddy?

314
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,959
- We two are your daddy's colleagues.
- Where's Daddy?

315
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,120
Daddy is cooking in the kitchen.

316
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,319
Richard, we're here.

317
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,280
You're here so early.

318
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,000
Have you decided when to leave?

319
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,848
Next week.

320
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,660
All these years, be it failure or success,

321
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,660
haven't we all gotten through?

322
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,339
I've thought about this for a long time.

323
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,660
When I was your age, I was just like you.

324
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,620
When I was your age, I was just like you.

325
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,340
All I could think about was work.

326
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,380
But I ignored the most important person,

327
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,100
and I couldn't even give her a complete home.

328
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,539
Daddy, why are you always busy?

329
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:51,220
That's because Daddy wants to do my best

330
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,080
to give you and your brother the best life.

331
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,679
But do you know what we children think?

332
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,940
Tell me.

333
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,660
Adults always want to earn more money,

334
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,480
but actually, children don't care if they live in a big house.

335
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,659
but actually, childrendon't care if they live in a big house.

336
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:10,240
What we want most is to come home every day and see our mom and dad.

337
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,620
What we want most is to come home every day and see our mom and dad.

338
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,859
I'm sorry, Dad. I made you sad.

339
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:23,060
I'm sorry, Dad. I made you sad.

340
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,219
It's not your fault. Dad didn't do well enough.

341
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,240
If Daddy can't earn more money in the future,

342
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,880
can't buy you the best of everything,

343
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,779
you won't blame Daddy, will you?

344
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:38,920
Of course not.

345
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,559
I just want to see you every day.

346
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,279
I promise.

347
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:01,020
I really didn't expect time to pass so quickly.

348
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,200
I haven't even had time to learn to be a good dad,

349
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,599
and the kids are all grown up.

350
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:12,560
I understand, but can you really let go?

351
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,719
In our industry, all the people you know...

352
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:16,770
In our industry, all the people you know...

353
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,080
come for profit and leave when it's gone.

354
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,720
You think you control the capital and the connections,

355
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
but in the end, it's nothing but an illusion; meaningless.

356
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,719
but in the end, it's nothing but an illusion; meaningless.

357
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,920
If you spend too much time in this world,

358
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,500
you won't know what to believe anymore.

359
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,280
I want to live differently in the next phase of my life.

360
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,980
Do you want to know what I regret the most?

361
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:54,920
Back then, Ada and I were on the same team.

362
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,340
We once made a good team.

363
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,100
But once, when she was on maternity leave,

364
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,299
I usurped her project and got promoted for it.

365
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:16,128
Elvis,

366
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,580
you need a "wolfish" nature in the workplace,

367
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,900
but never lose your humanity.

368
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,720
Take this as my parting gift to you.

369
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,760
Take this as my parting gift to you.

370
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,500
Ada.

371
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,019
Richard.

372
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,100
Thank you for coming.

373
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,820
Thank you for having me.

374
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,168
In front of the husband, sorry about that.

375
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:48,799
- Long time no see.
- Hello, Uncle.

376
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,759
What? She's so big!

377
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,960
- Yeah.
- Time flies.

378
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,459
Come on, come on in.

379
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,939
Let's do this together.

380
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,039
Miss Tang.

381
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,599
Are you distributing zongzi?
(Sticky rice dumplings)

382
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,140
I'll help.

383
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,980
Don't bother. We're almost done.

384
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,340
I have a client coming soon. The meeting rooms are all taken.

385
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,960
I have a client coming soon. The meeting rooms are all taken.

386
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,620
It's not appropriate to have a mess here. I'll make it faster.

387
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,720
It's not appropriate to have a mess here. I'll make it faster.

388
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,340
What client is coming?

389
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,439
The boss of Shi Zhi Literature City.

390
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,020
After that case with Maomao,

391
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,160
they think they need a professional legal team.

392
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,880
they think they need a professional legal team.

393
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,480
That's great, Miss Tang.

394
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,240
This is your first time bringing in such a big client. Right?

395
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,720
It's a case sent down by Mr. Zheng, and I just need to do my job.

396
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,419
It's a case sent down by Mr. Zheng, and I just need to do my job.

397
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:33,360
Don't be overly modest.

398
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,119
If you hadn't handled the plagiarism case so beautifully,

399
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,440
If you hadn't handled the plagiarism case so beautifully,

400
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,799
Shi Zhi Literature City, as the plaintiff, would not consider cooperating with us.

401
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,700
Shi Zhi Literature City, as the plaintiff, would not consider cooperating with us.

402
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,620
How could Mr. Zheng promote you without a raise?

403
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,920
If I were the boss, I would hold you in my palm,

404
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,480
afraid that you might jump to another firm.

405
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,340
Maybe he has other considerations.

406
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,920
I've even heard of such a thing as a disguised demotion, forcing people to quit.

407
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
I've even heard of such a thing as a disguised demotion, forcing people to quit.

408
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,559
I've even heard of such a thing as a disguised demotion, forcing people to quit.

409
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,799
That's not likely. But there is another possibility.

410
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,200
Now that she has clients,

411
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,720
they're afraid that clients might feel neglected

412
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,599
talking to someone without a good title.

413
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,164
What are you talking about?

414
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,000
Here.

415
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,059
The client will be here in five minutes.

416
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:14,039
All right.

417
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,600
What are you wearing?

418
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,219
Go change quickly.

419
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:19,008
Okay.

420
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,759
Miss Ada, a toast to you.

421
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,319
- Thank you.
- Come on, together.

422
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,480
Let's toast Richard together.

423
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,820
It's all in the wine.

424
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,704
Thank you.

425
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,440
As you all know, I'm from Taiwan.

426
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,920
When I first arrived in Beijing, I really had a hard time adjusting, you know?

427
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,479
When I first arrived in Beijing, I really had a hard time adjusting, you know?

428
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,060
That period…

429
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,060
But over the years, I've settled down in Beijing,

430
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,660
and have achieved a lot that makes me proud.

431
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
Now that I'm leaving,

432
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,460
it's quite hard for me to say goodbye.

433
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,319
it's quite hard for me to say goodbye.

434
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,759
I'm glad to have worked with you all these years.

435
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,580
If I've offended anyone in the past,

436
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,819
please forgive me.

437
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,000
Life is fleeting, but this is not the end.

438
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,520
If you have the chance in the future, you're welcome to visit me in Taipei,

439
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,100
and I'll treat you to a nice meal.

440
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,260
No problem. Let the past be the past.

441
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,459
It's all in the wine.

442
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:21,040
- Come, let's toast Richard together.
- Thank you, Ada.

443
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,940
- Come, let's toast Richard together.
- Thank you, Ada.

444
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,860
I wish you all the best.

445
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,740
All right, Mr. Xie, shall we call it a day?

446
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,900
All right, Mr. Xie, shall we call it a day?

447
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:43,580
Thank you, Mr. Xie. We will definitely live up to your expectations.

448
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,740
We've seen Miss Tang's work.

449
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,219
I believe this cooperation will also be very enjoyable.

450
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:48,820
I believe this cooperation will also be very enjoyable.

451
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,599
Thank you. I will organize the meeting minutes and send them to you.

452
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,880
Thank you. I will organize the meeting minutes and send them to you.

453
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,039
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

454
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,500
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

455
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,176
All right, thank you.

456
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:00,720
- Thank you.
- You're on your own from now on.

457
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,779
- Thank you.
- You're on your own from now on.

458
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,019
Richard, I'm not alone.

459
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,900
I wanted to bring my girlfriend to meet you.

460
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,159
Her name is Tang Ying, a lawyer.

461
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,140
So she's busier than you.

462
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,160
Yes, she's more addicted to work than me.

463
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,340
When it comes to finding a wife,

464
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,480
you should find someone who's family-oriented.

465
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,300
Otherwise, if both people are not at home, there's no warmth in the house.

466
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,599
Otherwise, if both people are not at home, there's no warmth in the house.

467
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,420
It doesn't feel like a home.

468
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,620
Then I'll just wait for her to get better and better,

469
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,079
and take a step back to become a househusband.

470
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,540
You're kidding me. I know you too well.

471
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,419
You can't leave this industry.

472
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:42,319
Why?

473
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,359
You're born for this industry. You're addicted to overtime.

474
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,060
Let me tell you, Richard. I might have this face that seems

475
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,400
Let me tell you, Richard. I might have this face that seems

476
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,659
to not have been ravaged by time. Right?

477
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:59,559
But sometimes when I think about it, I'm tired.

478
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,759
Well then, before I leave, let me give you some insider news.

479
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,679
Well then, before I leave, let me give you some insider news.

480
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,400
Do you remember, the Mr. Sen I mentioned, who grows grapes in the mountains?

481
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,020
Do you remember, the Mr. Sen I mentioned, who grows grapes in the mountains?

482
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,500
We've had a phone call, Old Sen. Right?

483
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,920
As far as I know, he might have a need for financing.

484
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,319
You can visit him when you have time.

485
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,700
But how big is his vineyard? Does he need financing?

486
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:27,599
All right, I'll go. I'll listen to you.

487
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,959
One of the three pitfalls in the workplace: promotion without a raise.

488
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:48,839
If you encounter this situation, you must be alert.

489
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:52,080
This is likely the boss painting a big picture for you.

490
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,519
There isn't more money, but a heavier workload.

491
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:56,960
This is actually using the so-called official hat

492
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,119
to make you work hard without complaint.

493
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,020
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

494
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,039
I mainly want to tell you that your salary won't be adjusted until the beginning of next year.

495
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,600
I mainly want to tell you that your salary won't be adjusted until the beginning of next year.

496
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,220
I've even heard of such a thing as a disguised demotion,

497
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,720
forcing people to quit.

498
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,000
How could Mr. Zheng promote you without a raise?

499
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,240
If I were the boss, I'd hold you in my palm.

500
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:43,584
Tang Ying, I've been looking for you. Come.

501
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,992
Take this.

502
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,280
Take it back, go through it carefully, and give it to me tomorrow.

503
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,168
Okay.

I have a question.

By all means.

513
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,319
She stared at the computer,

514
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:46,520
with her hands constantly hitting the keyboard.

515
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,179
The empty office was silent.

516
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,139
At this moment, the sound of the printer came faintly to her ears.

517
00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:57,480
At this moment, the sound of the printer came faintly to her ears.

518
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,920
- You scared me.
- You scared me. What are you doing?

519
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,840
- You scared me.
- You scared me. What are you doing?

520
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,459
I'm changing the paper.

521
00:25:20,459 --> 00:25:22,279
Empress Han said there was an urgent report. She asked me to come over and edit it quickly.

522
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,039
Empress Han said there was an urgent report. She asked me to come over and edit it quickly.

523
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,699
Finish it and leave quickly.

524
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:27,460
Okay, you should leave quickly too.

525
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,896
Okay.

526
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,416
Wang Yu?

527
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Sis, how come you're appearing out of nowhere?

528
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,200
Wait! You're cooking noodles in the middle of the night?

529
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,099
Who would expect that?

530
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,319
It smells so good. Can I have a bite?

531
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:59,776
Hungry?

532
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,319
- Take it over there. I'll get a bowl and chopsticks.
- Okay.

533
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,699
- Take it over there. I'll get a bowl and chopsticks.
- Okay.

534
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:07,299
- Be careful.
- Okay, leave it to me.

535
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,259
It smells so good.

536
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,860
- It's good. Right?
- Yeah.

537
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,600
This fried egg is not bad either.

538
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,199
That's right.

539
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,096
Wait for a moment.

540
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,480
There's only one can of cola left at home.

541
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,380
Here you go. Eat slowly, don't burn yourself.

542
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,612
Thank you.

543
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,300
Did you have a nightmare?

544
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,440
How do you know?

545
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,279
You looked lost earlier.

546
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,779
So I guessed.

547
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,739
I also have a stiff neck.

548
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,900
Why are you still up so late?

549
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,680
I have to livestream.

550
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,879
My nightlife is just beginning.

551
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,020
Want to listen to a song?

552
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,019
No problem. Sure.

553
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:23,900
Let me sing a song for you first.

554
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,699
What song would you like to hear?

555
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:29,620
Type it on the public screen.

556
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,359
Let's see them, come on.

557
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:40,850
Okay. Three, two, one...

558
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,710
Stop.

559
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,960
Okay, this one.

560
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,319

Lin Xinzi, wake up.

574
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,800
Lin Xinzi, the sun is shining on your butt.

575
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,000
Are you going to play basketball?

576
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,120
What basketball?

577
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,720
The sun is shining on your butt. And I'm going to bed.

578
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,620
The sun is shining on your butt. And I'm going to bed.

579
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,760
Lin Xinzi, do you not see me as a man?

580
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,940
How can you sleep so soundly in my bed?

581
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:52,159
Are you interested in me?

582
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:57,540
You're really thinking too much.

583
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,520
With your big flower pants guarding,

584
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,860
I think it's hard for a normal man to have any thoughts about you.

585
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,240
I'm going to sleep. Close the door behind you.

586
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,736
Don't touch things. This is not a picking garden. Okay?

587
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:03,820
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?

588
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,880
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?

589
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,299
I'm here to visit Mr. Zhao Linsen.

590
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,188
You've found him.

591
00:32:14,188 --> 00:32:15,860
Mr. Zhao, hello, hello.

592
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,059
I thought Mr. Zhao would be an older man.

593
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:19,900
I thought Mr. Zhao would be an older man.

594
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,580
Well, I'm certainly older than you.

595
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,140
Do you know why I won't let you touch them?

596
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,060
Grapes are very delicate.

597
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,279
It takes one year to breed, two years to bear fruit,

598
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,840
and three years to get to this point.

599
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,080
If you step on it, who can I talk to when something goes wrong?

600
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,559
If you step on it, who can I talk to when something goes wrong?

601
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,419
I'm really sorry. I've learned my lesson.

602
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:37,799
Are you here to invest?

603
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,799
Yes, Richard introduced me to come over today.

604
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,920
So I wanted to talk to you and see if we can work together.

605
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,419
So I wanted to talk to you and see if we can work together.

606
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,919
Richard, huh?

607
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,879
Let's make it clear first.

608
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:54,559
We only grow grapes here.

609
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,580
If you want to do something else,

610
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,659
you better go home now, got it?

611
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,759
You're in a good mood, choosing such a nice place.

612
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:10,639
You're in a good mood, choosing such a nice place.

613
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:12,179
Is there any good news?

614
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,240
I do have good news to tell you.

615
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,179
- I'm leaving.
- Leaving? Where to?

616
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,000
- I'm leaving.
- Leaving? Where to?

617
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,500
Tibet.

618
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:22,680
Tibet?

619
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,860
Tibet has a better offer?

620
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,944
I'm in love, and I'm going to go hiking with my boyfriend.

621
00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:31,720
- Cool, isn't it?
- Well, it's cool.

622
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,000
- Cool, isn't it?
- Well, it's cool.

623
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,400
Who is this boyfriend of yours? Are you getting deceived?

624
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,640
Who is this boyfriend of yours? Are you getting deceived?

625
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,440
You know my boyfriend.

626
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,104
Who is he?

627
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,384
Yan Lvning.

628
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,680
He… Is he quitting being a professor?

629
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,940
Y-You're all crazy.

630
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,080
You want to say that I'm love-brained, right?

631
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,439
No, not at all.

632
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:00,979
That's not… not what I thought.

633
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,059
This doesn't seem like something you would do.

634
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,680
On second thought, it really doesn't seem like something I would do.

635
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,919
On second thought, it really doesn't seem like something I would do.

636
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:10,840
But I found out that my life seems to be opposite to everyone else's.

637
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,080
But I found out that my life seems to be opposite to everyone else's.

638
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,199
Most people are rebellious during adolescence,

639
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,320
Most people are rebellious during adolescence,

640
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,780
and they grow up overnight when they enter society.

641
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,740
But me? I'm always obedient and hardworking,

642
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,260
finding my first love in my thirties.

643
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,800
He's your first love?

644
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,360
I'm just giving an example.

645
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,260
When you meet the right person, doesn't it feel like you are

646
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,840
When you meet the right person, doesn't it feel like you are

647
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,059
encountering your first love again?

648
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:36,780
Anyway, after all these experiences,

649
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,159
sometimes I feel there is not a clear line between right and wrong.

650
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,260
sometimes I feel there is not a clear line between right and wrong.

651
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,320
So isn't it more important to find someone you like,

652
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,900
So isn't it more important to find someone you like,

653
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,540
do things you like, and be happy and self-consistent?

654
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,656
Yes, it is.

655
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,919
If you've made up your mind, no matter what, I'll support you.

656
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,680
- I wish you happiness.
- Thank you.

657
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,559
- I wish you happiness.
- Thank you.

658
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,419
I'm feeling sorry for myself right now.

659
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,400
If you're gone, I'm alone again.

660
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,000
Why are you acting like a baby with me?

661
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,460
I'm not leaving for good. It's just a temporary farewell.

662
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,920
I even thought it was good news to share with you.

663
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,119
I even thought it was good news to share with you.

664
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,719
I just hope you won't end up like me, living more than half of your life,

665
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,800
I just hope you won't end up like me, living more than half of your life,

666
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,319
only to realize that not a single day was spent living for yourself.

667
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,320
Cherish the person in front of you.

668
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,539
Don't regret it when you've missed out.

669
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:31,719
We should all live our lives at our own pace, shouldn't we?

670
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:34,580
We should all live our lives at our own pace, shouldn't we?

671
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,180
Mr. Zhao, you said that breeding new varieties is costly and laborious.

672
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,360
Mr. Zhao, you said that breeding new varieties is costly and laborious.

673
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,919
Have you ever thought about setting up a value chain?

674
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:44,900
Have you ever thought about setting up a value chain?

675
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,080
Right? Even a winery.

676
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,260
Look! The world's largest winemaking group, IWB, went public

677
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,060
Look! The world's largest winemaking group, IWB, went public

678
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,800
on the Milan Stock Exchange in 2015.

679
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,000
You could totally be the Chinese IWB, couldn't you?

680
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,840
You could totally be the Chinese IWB, couldn't you?

681
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,320
IWB.

682
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,359
Do you know the biggest difference between here and IWB?

683
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:05,599
Do you know the agricultural land leasing system of China?

684
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,400
Do you know the agricultural land leasing system of China?

685
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,520
Do you know the agricultural land leasing system of China?

686
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,920
Do you know why in the world, 80% of grapes are used for winemaking,

687
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,400
Do you know why in the world, 80% of grapes are used for winemaking,

688
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,060
Do you know why in the world, 80% of grapes are used for winemaking,

689
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,199
but only 10% in China?

690
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:16,380
but only 10% in China?

691
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,360
Do you know how we can give farmers what they need most?

692
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,019
Do you know how we can give farmers what they need most?

693
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:21,719
Mr. Zhao, this is also why I came to visit you.

694
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,019
Mr. Zhao, this is also why I came to visit you.

695
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:25,080
Please enlighten me.

696
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:28,419
Do you really care?

697
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,559
Are you sure you're not trying to bulldoze this place

698
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:30,639
Are you sure you're not trying to bulldoze this place

699
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,260
and build some CS base or karting park?

700
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,559
You're not sent by the next village's head to play some merger and acquisition game, are you?

701
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:38,119
You're not sent by the next village's head to play some merger and acquisition game, are you?

702
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,979
Let me put it this way, Mr. Zhao.

703
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:41,480
Those places you mentioned, aren't they everywhere?

704
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,060
Those places you mentioned, aren't they everywhere?

705
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,960
If you're just starting now, forgive me for being blunt,

706
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,680
but you might not be able to beat them, because you're late to start.

707
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,320
but you might not be able to beat them, because you're late to start.

708
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,539
But some of your words have touched me.

709
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,180
You started your own business,

710
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,720
and you're keeping this orchard with some farmers.

711
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,519
and you're keeping this orchard with some farmers.

712
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,920
From my perspective, I'd like to see what I can do

713
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,040
From my perspective, I'd like to see what I can do

714
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,939
From my perspective, I'd like to see what I can do

715
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:08,200
based on your foundation and how I can help everyone.

716
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
based on your foundation and how I can help everyone.

717
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,639
I want a sense of accomplishment in making something happen.

718
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,260
I want a sense of accomplishment in making something happen.

719
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,019
All right.

720
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:20,260
Prepare yourself and follow me.

721
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,600
Shall we call a cab?

722
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,400
No need. It's just a short walk back.

723
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,219
Can you walk a kilometer in these shoes?

724
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:34,419
Aren't shoes worn on the feet for walking?

725
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,340
I'm just worried about your shoes.

726
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,780
They cost thousands, and now they're clattering on the cement.

727
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,600
They cost two hundred.

728
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,220
How about that? They look real, right?

729
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,010
I can give you the channel.

730
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,180
What about this bag?

731
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,780
The bag is real. It can't be counterfeited well.

732
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:55,079
I want to ask you something very presumptuously.

733
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,900
You're rich enough to go on vacation in Tibet,

734
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,640
so why did you buy fake shoes?

735
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,000
Shoes, to me, are consumables.

736
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,599
Showing the ability to make money

737
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,159
is more convincing than showing the ability to spend it.

738
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,999
is more convincing than showing the ability to spend it.

739
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,420
When you, as a person, are valuable enough,

740
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,399
you don't need the support of luxury goods.

741
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,979
Actually, I really hate to see you go, really.

742
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:22,840
There's something I didn't tell you.

743
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,400
Actually, before you came to Junheng,

744
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Actually, before you came to Junheng,

745
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,320
I was quite confused about my career prospects.

746
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,880
I was quite confused about my career prospects.

747
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,199
I didn't know what I wanted.

748
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,419
But after you came,

749
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:38,280
I figured it out, and I know what I want to do.

750
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
I have a clear vision of the person I want to be.

751
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,519
I have a clear vision of the person I want to be.

752
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,400
I have a clear vision of the person I want to be.

753
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,119
I didn't know I did that.

754
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,760
Of course, you're my best leader.

755
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,320
So, I'm your white moonlight?

756
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,719
- White moonlight, show me the channel then.
- Why don't you learn well?

757
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,960
- White moonlight, show me the channel then.
- Why don't you learn well?

758
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:03,280
♫ The choice. It started out like any other night ♫

759
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,030
♫ They will be there ♫

760
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,679
Look. These grapes are the ones we've cultivated.

761
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,880
Look. These grapes are the ones we've cultivated.

762
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,880
Just like I said, double vine pruning.

763
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,770
♫ Soon, we're gonna go upstairs in the dark room ♫

764
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:22,640
♫ Beat by the drum, as we walk through the park ♫

765
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,750
♫ Give out the feeling of fire in your heart ♫

766
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,870
♫ You give out the feeling of fire in your heart ♫

767
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,710
♫ Soon, we're gonna go upstairs in the dark room ♫

768
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,750
♫ Beat by the drum, as we walk through the park ♫

769
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,660
♫ Give out the feeling of fire in your heart ♫

770
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,150
♫ You give out the feeling of fire in your heart ♫

771
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:45,000
The court is about to start, and I have to accompany the client to gather evidence today.

772
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,460
I might be very late tonight.

773
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,999
Work is important, but don't overdo it. Okay?

774
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,856
Boss.

775
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,300
♫ In the road... ♫

776
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:03,330
♫ We'll always cross over to the brighter side ♫

777
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,099
There's champagne from clients in the cabinet. Chill it when you get back.

778
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:15,880
I'll bring your favorite Spanish food home.

779
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,159
Today in the vineyard, I saw cute little wildflowers

780
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,780
which reminded me of the bouquet you gave me.

781
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,719
They're already on the table.

782
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,540
Miss Tang, the documents are sorted for you.

783
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,368
Thank you.

784
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:31,190
[I love you]

785
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:33,960
Greetings, Miss Tang.

786
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,499
Okay, give me the documents. Thank you.

787
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,560
Here you go, Miss Ying.

788
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,024
Okay.

789
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,780
Okay, thanks.

790
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,000
Okay, okay.

791
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,300
Today is not bad.

792
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,880
Mrs. Li, you picked a lot.

793
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,800
Not bad today. 16 catties.

794
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
16 catties, note it down.

795
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,360
Put it here.

796
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,800
Miss Zhao.

797
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,176
Mr. Li, thank you.

798
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:03,400
Take care.

799
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Let's see how we did today.

800
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,340
- Xiaomei, you lost some weight.
- 16 catties.

801
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,980
- 16 catties.
- Take care.

802
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,420
That's a lot. That's great.

803
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,320
Everyone seems very happy.

804
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,719
Yes.

805
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,160
Today's harvest is quite good.

806
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,880
I always tell them

807
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,819
to always sow, often expect, and sometimes harvest.

808
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:20,740
to always sow, often expect, and sometimes harvest.

809
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,359
Sometimes harvest.

810
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,920
Often expect and sometimes harvest.

811
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,200
Six catties, six catties.

812
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,300
Let's have a talk tonight.

813
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,359
Can you come home early?

814
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,944
Cosplay?

815
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:49,320
What cosplay?

816
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,899
Don't I look cute?

817
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:54,619
Yes, you do.

818
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:55,960
But don't you think it's a bit… too much?

819
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,180
But don't you think it's a bit… too much?

820
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,539
Then what do you think I look good in?

821
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:02,939
You're great just being yourself. You don't need to change.

822
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,079
Do you have plans later?

823
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,019
Come listen to me sing.

824
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,559
What? What singing?

825
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,960
I hear you sing at home every day, isn't that enough?

826
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,280
The atmosphere is different.

827
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,240
Should I bring a camera?

828
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,400
No need. When you see pretty things,

829
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,259
just enjoy with your eyes.

830
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,200
Then I'll change my clothes.

831
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:35,200
You said it was too much.

832
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,319
I'll wait for you.

00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:46,650

Lo que quieras beber te invito.
(I'll invite you to drink whatever you want.)

851
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:06,816
What?

852
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:10,379
It's Spanish. What would you like to drink? It's on me.

00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,500
No, thanks.

854
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:19,660
Boss, a Mojito.

855
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,408
Mojito.

856
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,000
This drink has a lower alcohol content and is more suitable for you.

857
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,400
Have you seen a variety show called

00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,400
Ride the Wind?

859
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,579
Sorry, I don't watch variety shows.

860
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:39,239
There is a guest I really like in it.

861
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,280
She said something really famous.

862
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,360
She said something really famous.

863
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,539
What did she say?

864
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:49,239
I hate show-offs the most.

865
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:04,199
Can you watch your step?

866
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,600
What's wrong? Not singing anymore?

867
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,700
I'm tired from singing. I can't sing all the time.

868
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,519
I just took a handsome photo of you.

869
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:26,419
You can use it as your screen saver.

870
00:46:26,419 --> 00:46:28,480
You sounded good, really.

871
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,859
Who was that guy just now? A bit creepy, right?

872
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:34,700
I have no idea.

873
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,639
Just a low-level guy,

874
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:39,719
not worth taking a second look.

875
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:41,700
Right, he looked bad.

876
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,200
Right?

877
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,640
You're sitting a bit off to the side here.

878
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:52,300
Let me find a spot for you. Come to the front to listen to me sing.

879
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,399
I dressed up so handsomely today, and you should take a good look.

880
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,119
Are you that thirsty?

881
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:02,920
- What's wrong?
- This is my water.

882
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,080
- What's wrong?
- This is my water.

883
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,339
So what? What age are we in?

884
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:09,760
So what? What age are we in?

885
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,160
Don't mind the indirect kissing thing.

886
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,016
Childish.

887
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,899
Here you go.

888
00:47:17,899 --> 00:47:19,776
Let's go.

889
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:28,119
The door's open.

890
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:29,792
Tang Ying.

891
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,730
Ying.

892
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,780
Tang Ying.

893
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,280
I'm in here.

894
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,500
Can I come in?

895
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,219
Of course.

896
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,080
I see you're enjoying yourself.

897
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,440
You weren't home yet, so I thought I'd take a bath to relax.

898
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,039
You weren't home yet, so I thought I'd take a bath to relax.

899
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:19,700
I visited a vineyard in the suburbs today, and it's a bit far.

900
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,440
There was a traffic jam on the way back.

901
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:26,880
Take your time. I'll go out.

902
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,864
Don't.

903
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,320
Read me a story.

904
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:46,899
"And then, he continued,

905
00:48:46,899 --> 00:48:49,959
'Go and look at the rose again.

906
00:48:49,959 --> 00:48:53,539
You will understand that your rose

907
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:55,979
is unique in all the world.'

908
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,740
Because I watered her,

909
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,679
sheltered her,

910
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:05,880
shielded her,

911
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,440
and got rid of caterpillars for her.

912
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:13,800
I've listened to her complaints

913
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,820
and her bragging,

914
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,340
and sometimes we sat in silence.

915
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,780
Because…

916
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,539
because she is my rose."

917
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,152
Xu Ziquan,

918
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,060
kiss me.

919
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,660
I went to the hospital a few days ago.

920
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,336
What's wrong?

921
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:18,900
Remember when we went camping last time, and I had chest pain?

922
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,440
Remember when we went camping last time, and I had chest pain?

923
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,500
I went for a check-up later.

924
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,200
What did the doctor say?

925
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,279
There are two… two small nodules.

926
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:30,860
There are two… two small nodules.

927
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,619
Nothing serious.

928
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:34,260
I just need regular check-ups.

929
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,192
So…

930
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,480
Did you go alone?

931
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,599
I went there first, and then my sister came.

932
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,019
I went there first, and then my sister came.

933
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:47,220
You don't trust me.

934
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,519
Of course, I trust you.

935
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:50,760
I was just afraid that I'd be a burden to you.

936
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,160
I was just afraid that I'd be a burden to you.

937
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,660
Just like you don't tell me when you're unhappy.

938
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,479
Just like you don't tell me when you're unhappy.

939
00:50:58,479 --> 00:50:59,460
I understand. You're afraid that your negative emotions will affect me.

940
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:03,040
I understand. You're afraid that your negative emotions will affect me.

941
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:07,439
I'm sorry, Ying.

942
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:13,719
I was so used to being alone,

943
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:15,840
and now suddenly I'm sharing my world with someone else,

944
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,180
and now suddenly I'm sharing my world with someone else,

945
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,440
I'm not fully adapted.

946
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,300
I'm a bit caught off guard.

947
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,340
It's not that I don't want to tell you,

948
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,840
it's just that I'm afraid once I tell you, these negative emotions will affect you.

949
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,579
it's just that I'm afraid once I tell you, these negative emotions will affect you.

950
00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:29,039
After all, sometimes,

951
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,860
you know I'm also trying to avoid what I don't want to face.

952
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,260
you know I'm also trying to avoid what I don't want to face.

953
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:38,300
Many people can't go on because

954
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,159
their emotional rhythms are not synchronized.

955
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,760
But being with you,

956
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,159
I love you and I cherish you.

957
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,159
So from now on, can you share your joys...

958
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:55,939
So from now on, can you share your joys...

959
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:58,319
and sorrows with me?

960
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,840
But if all the bad sides are exposed to you,

961
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,719
But if all the bad sides are exposed to you,

962
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,660
are you sure you can take it?

963
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:11,959
Do you know how good you are?

964
00:52:11,959 --> 00:52:14,439
You're really good.

965
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:15,760
What could be so bad compared to your goodness?

966
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,919
What could be so bad compared to your goodness?

967
00:52:17,919 --> 00:52:20,820
And if I can only see the good parts,

968
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:23,260
what kind of love is that?

969
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,460
I also have many, not-so-good traits.

970
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,519
Haven't you been tolerating me?

971
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:30,139
In many aspects.

972
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:34,380
The only thing is you don't trust others much.

973
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,280
Just like you said, you are too independent.

974
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,900
But can you trust me?

975
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,780
Just like what the little fox said.

976
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,880
You... are my bondage.

977
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,639
Yes, come and tame me.

978
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:01,130
♫ In your love's embrace I've found my bliss ♫

979
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:05,370
♫ Pure and free ♫

980
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:13,440
♫ Together we will write our symphony ♫

981
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,040
♫ With every breath, I'm enchanted anew ♫

982
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:23,660
♫ Wrapped in your arms in this magical room ♫

983
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,150
♫ Just you and me ♫

984
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:30,160
Autumn is here. I'll help you put on some weight in advance.

985
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,519
You never eat properly.

986
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,559
Look at you. Always thinking about work.

987
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,519
Look how skinny you've become.

988
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:38,960
If I really eat a lot and get fat, you'll probably dislike me.

989
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,940
You can't get fat after one or two meals.

990
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,960
Do you know that when you evaluate

991
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,820
the food, you're particularly pretentious?

992
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,619
- Am I?
- Let me show you.

993
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:47,800
- Am I?
- Let me show you.

994
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,480
All right.

995
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,520
First of all, gentleman, look at our table.

996
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,359
First of all, gentleman, look at our table.

997
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:55,040
What first catches our eye is this dish, a famous Ningbo dish,

998
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,940
What first catches our eye is this dish, a famous Ningbo dish,

999
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,639
Eighteen Cuts,

1000
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:01,400
splitting a crab into eighteen pieces.

1001
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,680
See? The cutout crab is completely different

1002
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,980
from the usual ones.

1003
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,559
Just like a flower, blooming in front of you.

1004
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:12,299
Next up, is this soy sauce duck.

1005
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:14,579
Try its flavor.

1006
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:23,360
Amazing! And it melts in your mouth.

1007
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,900
This marinade must be a family secret recipe of this chef.

1008
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,480
It's cooked on high heat.

1009
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,639
- No, no, wait. Hold on, hold on.
- Then it will be… a month-long of…

1010
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,320
- No, no, wait. Hold on, hold on.
- Then it will be… a month-long of…

1011
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,140
- Look.
- Can't stand it, can you?

1012
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,960
I'm telling you. This is what you do.

1013
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,320
Then there's this duck…

1014
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,459
Do you have a mirror?

1015
00:54:41,459 --> 00:54:43,159
I think you should take a look.

1016
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:45,000
- Not that trick.
- It's not a trick.

1017
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,079
When I look in the mirror, you'll say you've never seen such a beautiful girl.

1018
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,800
When I look in the mirror, you'll say you've never seen such a beautiful girl.

1019
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,079
Yes, I've never seen one before.

1020
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:51,719
You're so beautiful that I'm transforming. Take a look.

1021
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:54,039
If this is a prank, I'll kill you.

1022
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,260
I'm so ugly.

1023
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,440
Don't look at me anymore.

1024
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,559
We're almost home.

1025
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:05,559
Now, do I look like a pig head?

1026
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:07,280
Don't worry, even if you've become a pig head, you're still the cutest, most beautiful pig head.

1027
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,079
Don't worry, even if you've become a pig head, you're still the cutest, most beautiful pig head.

1028
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:11,168
Come on, give me a kiss.

1029
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:15,159
I'll become a pig head with you. Okay?

1030
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,560
Am I this ugly now?

1031
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,880
Stop messing around.

1032
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,599
I feel sad now.

1033
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,599
You're so annoying.

1034
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,479
Xu Ziquan. Is this your girlfriend?

1035
00:55:35,479 --> 00:55:37,300
Xu Ziquan. Is this your girlfriend?

1036
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,159
One uglier than the other. Is this your type?

1037
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:40,860
One uglier than the other. Is this your type?

1038
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,560
Why are you here again?

1039
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,639
Didn't we make things clear last time?

1040
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:48,320
Let's go.

1041
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,639
You go in first. I'll send her away.

1042
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:02,336
- Door is open.
- Go ahead.

1043
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:05,640
Yes, don't worry.

1044
00:56:12,199 --> 00:56:13,900
So she really is your girlfriend, huh?

1045
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,820
So her WeChat profile picture is highly edited.

1046
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,480
She looks like a different person in life.

1047
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,440
No, Yu Chuanchuan, that's too far.

1048
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,380
Yu Chuanchuan, is it?

1049
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,160
You've been standing here for a long time, and you must be tired.

1050
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,040
Why don't you come inside for a cup of tea?

1051
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,599
Why don't you come inside for a cup of tea?

1052
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:34,879
Sit for a while, and let's have a chat.

1053
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,352
Interesting.

1054
00:56:49,879 --> 00:56:52,771
♫ Never expected before that there would come a day ♫

1055
00:56:52,771 --> 00:56:56,696
♫ Never expected before that there would come a day ♫

1056
00:56:56,696 --> 00:57:01,095
♫ When I'm no longer alone in this city ♫

1057
00:57:01,095 --> 00:57:03,987
♫ Still don't understand ♫

1058
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:06,764
♫ The fact that I fall in love with you ♫

1059
00:57:06,764 --> 00:57:10,507
♫ Yet you know ♫

1060
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:12,683
♫ All the answers ♫

1061
00:57:12,683 --> 00:57:15,070
♫ The daily grind has never changed ♫

1062

♫ The daily grind has never changed ♫

1063
00:57:18,819 --> 00:57:23,787
♫ Every commuting morning, and every late-night supper ♫

1064
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:26,983
♫ The charming trivialities ♫

1065
00:57:26,983 --> 00:57:29,579
♫ Now have your company ♫

1066
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:33,292
♫ This is love ♫

1067
00:57:35,063 --> 00:57:38,545
♫ I wish to go with you to every city ♫

1068
00:57:38,545 --> 00:57:41,728
♫ I wish to go with you to every city ♫

1069
00:57:41,728 --> 00:57:46,396
♫ Holding each other in neon lights and moonlight ♫

1070
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:51,652
♫ Every street will be marked ♫

1071
00:57:51,652 --> 00:57:56,306
♫ With my love for you ♫

1072
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:01,457
♫ The world of the two of us ♫

1073
00:58:01,457 --> 00:58:03,929
♫ Unexpected scenes ♫

1074
00:58:03,929 --> 00:58:09,040
♫ Are the future I see from your eyes ♫

1075
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,691
♫ It's only us ♫

1076
00:58:11,691 --> 00:58:14,733
♫ Who guessed the right time ♫

1077

♫ The most romantic thing ♫

1082
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:37,338
♫ Is to waste time ♫

1083
00:58:37,338 --> 00:58:41,673
♫ With you ♫

1084
00:58:43,302 --> 00:58:46,291
♫ Each of our days ♫

1085
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:49,327
♫ Is worth commemorating ♫

1086
00:58:49,327 --> 00:58:54,330
♫ Until time pieces together every detail ♫

1087
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,295
♫ Because of you ♫

1088
00:58:57,295 --> 00:58:59,959
♫ Because of me ♫
