1
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,694
But…

2
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,323
to be honest…

3
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,703
I don't agree with
what Yu-bin's mother is saying.

4
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:23,416
Someone as kind as Jul-pin's mother
would never do something like that.

5
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,295
I think that's
Yu-bin's mother's misjudgment.

6
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,298
I believe that Julpin's mother

7
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,009
has good intentions.

8
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,135
That's right.

9
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,305
-I wonder why she distorted--
-So…

10
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,308
what are you trying to say right now?

11
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,727
Get rid of the class for gifted students?

12
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,146
Or are you just
trying to pick a fight with me?

13
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,440
Yu-bin's mother. How could you say--

14
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,361
Whenever you called me you said,

15
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,321
"A kid that's on Yu-bin's level."

16
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,949
I hated the way you phrased it.

17
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:02,539
All of our kids are equal and precious.

18
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:07,335
Why do you insist on ranking
the children against each other?

19
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,223
What's Henry's mother's problem?

20
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,100
Why is she stirring the pot like that?

21
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,018
She's rich, so is that it?

22
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,479
She can send her kid
anywhere if she wanted to.

23
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,481
What about regular people like us?

24
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,941
I know.

25
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,820
If they get rid of the class for gifted
students, what about their resumes?

26
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,031
-Use private services for portfolios?
-Exactly my point.

27
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,493
We're not even allowed to use
any honors from outside of school.

28
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,830
If Sangwe is the only one without
that program, we'll be falling behind.

29
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:44,789
Exactly.

30
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,833
I came here because of that program.

31
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,295
This could even end up affecting
the housing prices in the neighborhood.

32
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,337
Come on.

33
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,301
Aren't you going to
do something, Chun-hui?

34
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:02,640
I feel like all my stress
went away in an instant.

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,560
Thank you, Henry's mother.

36
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:09,772
I never knew you were
such a forward-thinking person.

37
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,193
There's no need for all the praise.

38
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,237
Oh, please.

39
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,698
I feel so confident
and reassured because of you.

40
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,117
You know what,

41
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,828
why don't we go to my place and discuss--

42
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,996
No, thank you.

43
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,875
I have quite a bit of work to do.

44
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,294
Oh, okay.

45
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,767
Did Dad go somewhere?

46
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,144
I don't know.

47
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,022
All right, enjoy your book.

48
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,737
Hello, ma'am.

49
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,073
You have a guest waiting.

50
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,252
Hello, Director.

51
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,883
The top 0.01 percent?

52
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:23,096
But at school, they've been telling me
he lacks concentration.

53
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,640
Right, that happens sometimes.

54
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,559
When gifted children are given a text,

55
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,187
they get into
what's called divergent thinking.

56
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,023
And it's often misdiagnosed as ADHD.

57
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,483
I see.

58
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,903
Have you ever heard of the phrase
"gifted underachiever"?

59
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,198
Even with students as bright as Dong-seok,

60
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,411
they often fail to reach their full
potential and their talents fade away

61
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,705
if their intelligence is misdiagnosed.

62
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,916
Which is why we stress
the importance of parents' support.

63
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,711
Dong-seok.

64
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,840
Do you remember bundle numbers
from the open class day?

65
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,092
How did you come up with 495?

66
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,469
It was a chocolate bar.

67
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,179
What?

68
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,808
Look, there are 15 pieces.

69
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,727
So if there are 33 chocolate bars,

70
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,062
that means
there are 495 pieces of chocolate.

71
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:18,735
But don't you have trouble
learning your multiplication tables?

72
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,406
It's easier to count in my head.

73
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,579
Then what about the picture of our house
in the back of the classroom?

74
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,456
Why did you draw butterflies?

75
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,585
Our house looks like a butterfly.

76
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,711
What?

77
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,549
Our apartment looks like a butterfly
from a bird's-eye view.

78
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,259
Didn't you know that, Mom?

79
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,483
WONDERFUL VIEWS APARTMENTS

80
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,151
Goodness gracious, look at him.

81
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,446
It looks like he just wanted
to go outside and play.

82
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,333
GIFTED PERSON SPECIAL
PARK JONG-HUN, 8 YEARS OLD

83
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,085
THE LITTLE EDISON
SEEMS TO BE MAKING SOMETHING TODAY

84
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,462
Eun-pyo.

85
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,047
Did Dong-seok make this?

86
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,007
Yes.

87
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,426
Hang on a second.

88
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,970
Is he a genius?

89
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,516
How does he know the principles
of a crane and a watermill?

90
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,935
Everyone thinks their child is a genius.

91
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,145
Stop messing around and tidy up.

92
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,939
This is really something else.

93
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,654
Let's be bats

94
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,782
Bats see the world upside-down

95
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,618
Dong-seok, is it okay
if I throw away this box?

96
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,787
No, don't throw it away!

97
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,542
Let's be bats

98
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,378
DONG-SEOK'S TREASURE CHEST
DON'T OPEN

99
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,589
TITLE: LET'S BE BATS

100
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,433
LET'S BE BATS
THE CAVE IS WET AND DARK

101
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,793
EPISODE 4
ENTERING GREEN MOTHERS' CLUB

102
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,754
This is how I feel.

103
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,843
When I think of artists that lived
with more passion than anyone else,

104
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,680
I wonder why I feel

105
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,892
so very jealous.

106
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,854
It could be an artist's instinct.

107
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,366
Do you know of Jeanne Hébuterne,

108
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,702
Modigliani's muse?

109
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,079
No.

110
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:41,896
Jeanne was nine months pregnant
when Modigliani passed away.

111
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,400
Was it because he asked her to be
his model even after he went to heaven?

112
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,403
The day after Modigliani died,

113
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,822
she jumped from the sixth floor

114
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,825
and followed her husband
into the afterlife.

115
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,791
That's…

116
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,461
a really inspirational story.

117
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,050
I knew a great story would get
a strong reaction out of you.

118
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,095
Director,

119
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,639
I hope you write a story

120
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,935
that is as passionate
and beautiful as theirs.

121
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,878
You must be pretty upset.

122
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,507
I was so stressed out.

123
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,967
I apologize.

124
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,053
Are you trying to be nice after all that?

125
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,098
You're here, Mom.

126
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,308
Gosh, I'm hungry.

127
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,268
This looks great.

128
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,688
What do you want?

129
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,481
Let's eat first.

130
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,191
Gosh, I'm getting frustrated!

131
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,319
Stop beating around the bush.

132
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,195
Just tell me.

133
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,908
Mother, we decided

134
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,952
not to sell the house.

135
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:20,870
Why?

136
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,875
Didn't you say you wanted to
move out to the countryside?

137
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,376
Dong-seok is a gifted child.

138
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,757
They say he's a highly gifted child
who's in the top 0.01 percent.

139
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,176
It's probably because
he takes after Eun-pyo, right?

140
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,512
Please, you imbecile…

141
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,681
So?

142
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,601
Tell me more about it.

143
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,646
Yes, his teacher from school called us

144
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,315
and said we should raise him well
because he's special.

145
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,193
And when he took an aptitude test,

146
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,987
he scored in the top 0.01 percentile.

147
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,794
-How's the food?
-It's really good.

148
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,422
Gosh, he must take after his father.

149
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:18,386
If only I was more supportive
when you were a high school senior.

150
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,262
Police University? Please.

151
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,390
You would've gone to Geoseong University.

152
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,809
Police University is considered
much better than before…

153
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,311
I think I might be able to
get you that part-time job.

154
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,729
Do you want to give it a try?

155
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,398
-Eat up.
-Still…

156
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,484
-Eat up, Mother.
-Sure.

157
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,820
PARENTING TIPS TO HELP YOUR CHILD
BUILD THEIR POTENTIAL

158
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,285
I'm here for the meet-up
for the parents of gifted students.

159
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,495
What's your ID?

160
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,830
"Tiny Conqueror."

161
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,084
You want to go around
telling people that your child

162
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,294
has been classified as gifted, right?

163
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,712
You want to brag, right?

164
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,797
However…

165
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,049
I urge you not to.

166
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,801
They will only become a target.

167
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,637
Moreover, gifted students have a tendency

168
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,098
to absorb information right away
so they find it hard to write down

169
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,183
their process of solving problems.

170
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,103
CCI ACADEMY FOR GIFTED CHILDREN

171
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,610
CCI ACADEMY FOR GIFTED CHILDREN:
A PROVEN SYSTEM, HIGHEST PASS RATE

172
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,122
Eun-pyo.

173
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,708
Are you still mad at me?

174
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,210
Of course.

175
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,755
Eun-pyo, can you try and understand me?

176
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,216
You know I have a big mouth.

177
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:46,682
And you know what? I was actually
trying to stand up for Dong-seok

178
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,726
and that's when you butted in…

179
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,520
Goodness…

180
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,984
So where are you moving to?

181
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,280
We decided not to.

182
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,782
That's great!

183
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,369
You know boys are slow to bloom.

184
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,080
That's not reason enough
to move out of this neighborhood.

185
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,791
This is great.

186
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,422
Eun-pyo, I'm late. I better run.

187
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,590
Where are you going?

188
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,761
Yu-bin's mom wanted to get everyone
together to come up with a plan.

189
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,514
Can I go with you?

190
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,934
You?

191
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,108
Is she not moving out?

192
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,489
What kind of situation is this?

193
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,078
Gosh, she can't take a hint.

194
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,705
Like mother, like son.

195
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,101
-Hey.
-Yes?

196
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,853
-Jae-bin goes to a science academy, right?
-Yes, of course.

197
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,065
Then will Jae-bin be attending
the Rube Goldberg Contest this time?

198
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,611
Really? Then can Su-bin
maybe join his team?

199
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,698
She really wants to join
but it's so difficult to find a team.

200
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,075
-Yes, it is hard.
-That's what I'm saying.

201
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,996
The thing is, I'm not the one
that can make the decision.

202
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,582
Exactly, so…

203
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,418
Can't you put in a good word for us?

204
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,211
-But I can't really…
-But still--

205
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,421
She's finally here.

206
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,797
Hurry up.

207
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,965
Hey, Chun-hui.

208
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,092
-Sorry for being late.
-No worries.

209
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,176
Have a seat.

210
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,014
Goodness, it's Dong-seok's mom.

211
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,557
Hello.

212
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,185
I told her we had a meeting today
and she said she wanted to join.

213
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,690
I wonder what you want to know
when you're moving out soon.

214
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,358
That's what I'm saying.

215
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,360
Eun-pyo isn't moving out.

216
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,905
You're not moving?

217
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,323
No.

218
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,200
Then why did you come here?

219
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,580
If you're here to insist on getting rid of
the class for gifted students,

220
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,749
you've come to the wrong meeting.

221
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,917
I'm for it.

222
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,464
I agree that there should be
a class for gifted students.

223
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,357
Did something happen?

224
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,735
You did a complete 180 on your stance.

225
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,656
Well, I thought
I should come to my senses.

226
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,993
Sure, you did the right thing.

227
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,329
Anyone can talk about ideals.

228
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,375
So, on that note…

229
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,545
Yu-bin is getting ready
for the Rube Goldberg Contest, right?

230
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,468
Can you let Dong-seok join her team?

231
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,557
I don't know about other subjects,
but he's pretty good at science.

232
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,150
I'm sorry,

233
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,196
but I don't like to mix my personal
relationships with my child's education.

234
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,824
I'm not trying to
take advantage of our connection.

235
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,868
Dong-seok is sharper than people think.

236
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,372
But we're in it to win.

237
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,584
They look upon achievements like this
very highly at Geoseong University.

238
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,004
We'll win. I promise you.

239
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,012
How can I believe that?

240
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,014
Do you have a hidden card up your sleeve?

241
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,018
Henry's not an option anyway.

242
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,021
It won't be easy
to find someone to fill his shoes.

243
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,234
Why not try betting on someone new?

244
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:25,335
GENERAL HONG-YI'S GINSENG TONIC

245
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,213
Guys, let's drink this.
You have to stay healthy.

246
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,924
This one is for Dong-ju.
This one is for Dong-seok.

247
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,222
That's a good boy.

248
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,808
Dong-ju, you too.

249
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,363
Dong-seok, there's an academy
where they teach

250
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,240
a bunch of interesting stuff like this.

251
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,825
Do you want to go?

252
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:03,290
Mommy really wants to show everyone
how special you really are.

253
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,667
Do they have a lot of toys?

254
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,837
Of course! I bet they have
100 times more toys than we do.

255
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,963
Okay, then.

256
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,006
All right.

257
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,096
Yes!

258
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,235
She's definitely up to something.

259
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,362
Who is, Mom?

260
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,115
It's nothing.

261
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,459
There's something I want to discuss.

262
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:09,565
I'll be your celebrity

263
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,986
I'll entertain you

264
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,864
Acting and dancing…

265
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,782
Get out!

266
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,620
Wait.

267
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,331
It's Mr. Lee Man-su.

268
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,499
Mr. Lee Man-su!

269
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,709
Hello.

270
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,127
Mr. Lee Man-su!

271
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,879
You punk.

272
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,422
Jeez, you punk.

273
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,591
-Hey!
-Yes, sir.

274
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,259
I'm glad you're here, Man-su.

275
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,929
Hey, wait.

276
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,056
Everyone listen up!

277
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,309
Come on, you punks.

278
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:46,894
This is…

279
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,814
This is a very special guest, okay?

280
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,109
Even his name is sophisticated.

281
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,238
It's Mr. Lee Man-su from Pharm de Lyon!

282
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,656
Sit down, Man-su.

283
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,200
Man-su, sit down.

284
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,493
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes, sir.

285
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,621
I'm glad you came.

286
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,498
I'm glad you came.

287
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,252
Good.

288
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,596
Hey.

289
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,722
Yes, sir.

290
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,391
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

291
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,605
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

292
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,365
No one here knows

293
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,867
that I made someone croak.

294
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,370
Right.

295
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,996
You didn't say anything, did you?

296
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,582
No, I didn't.

297
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,752
That's funny.

298
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,880
Good.

299
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,883
Good job.

300
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,052
-Have a drink.
-Yes.

301
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,762
Good, drink up.

302
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,181
-Hey, drink.
-Yes.

303
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,100
-Finish it all the way.
-Thank you.

304
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,852
-Have a drink, okay?
-Yes, sir.

305
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,271
Have a nice long drink.

306
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,358
You're back?

307
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,322
I told you not to buy more.

308
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,782
Seriously…

309
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,703
You only had two cans to carry…

310
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,040
Why did you pay 50 won for a plastic bag?

311
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,085
You always spend money
on things you shouldn't.

312
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,672
What's the reason?

313
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,550
Don't be so quick to judge.

314
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,054
Sometimes there can be more
to boys than meets the eye.

315
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,473
That depends on
which kid you're talking about.

316
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:34,186
What if the kids work their butt off
only to lose because of him?

317
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:38,190
Chun-hui, what do you think about Su-in?

318
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,525
-She's pretty smart.
-No.

319
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,944
We don't need any more girls.

320
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,864
Then you should've had Henry join.

321
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,491
Why did you choose the blacklisted kid?

322
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,617
That's what I'm saying.

323
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,541
Then maybe you should've done it yourself.

324
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,046
Are you just going to complain
when you haven't done much?

325
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,008
Stick to one thing.

326
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,136
She was your worst enemy
when she went against us

327
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,430
but now you want her to be on your team?

328
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,815
We'll give it a shot.
If it doesn't work, I'll kick him out.

329
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,068
How's that?

330
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,027
She's right.

331
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,155
Have some tea.
I just bought it. It's good.

332
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,407
Oh, yes, it's really good.

333
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,536
Jeez, that's hot.

334
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,412
Oh, it smells so good…

335
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,877
What's taking so long?

336
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,767
I'm sorry, Yun-ju.
Dong-seok will be joining the team.

337
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,103
Dong-seok?

338
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,690
Why Dong-seok all of a sudden?

339
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,236
He was highly recommended by Chun-hui.

340
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,491
How can you steal that place from me?

341
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,535
Do you really think
Dong-seok can handle it?

342
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,287
Do you know the level of those kids?

343
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,831
Is Dong-seok still
some kind of joke to you?

344
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,748
I…

345
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,962
If you keep disrespecting my son,
I'm not going to let it slide.

346
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,387
This is so annoying.

347
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:39,477
DIDIMJAE

348
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:06,588
It was a good idea, wasn't it?
It pays a lot better than translating

349
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,800
and they'll be even happier since
you're also well-versed in humanities.

350
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,928
You were the first person I thought of.

351
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,263
Thank you.

352
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,099
So who will it be about?

353
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,184
Right.

354
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:23,396
CHOI JAE-SEOK

355
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,899
He must be famous…

356
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,526
Isn't he good-looking?

357
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,986
He was adopted in France.

358
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,821
He's a general manager
at a pharmaceutical company.

359
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,157
Right. Since you were coming today,

360
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,201
I asked him to drop by if he had time.

361
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,588
What a coincidence.

362
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,175
It sure is a small world.

363
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,887
So, are you the one
who introduced him to his wife?

364
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,724
Yes.

365
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,604
Do you think your wife
might have anything against this?

366
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,315
You can never be too cautious
as married individuals.

367
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,609
That…

368
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,028
won't be an issue, I think.

369
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:18,451
I'd prefer for Ms. Lee to do this
rather than someone I don't know.

370
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,375
It won't make things uncomfortable?

371
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,795
Why? Are you uncomfortable?

372
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,756
No, there's nothing
to be uncomfortable about.

373
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,259
What are you saying?

374
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,054
Just stuff about the book.

375
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,815
Hello?

376
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,984
Rhéa, it's me.

377
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,238
I was wondering if you could introduce me
to some French publishers?

378
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,657
I'd like to publish
a translated copy soon.

379
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,828
Yes.

380
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,804
Jae-seok, I appreciate you
getting me this job,

381
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,932
but I think it'll be better
if you find someone else…

382
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,481
Dong-seok's mom, join the science team.

383
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,942
Each class is 100,000 won,
so it's 400,000 won per month.

384
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,527
Extra for special classes.

385
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:41,409
JAE-SEOK

386
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,707
No! I can't win a prize
with him on my team!

387
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,210
Just give it a shot, okay?

388
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,462
We can try and if doesn't work out,
we can stop.

389
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,006
It's obvious what's going to happen.

390
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,842
He's such a dummy in school!

391
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,097
I won't do it.

392
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,349
Sit down, would you? Listen to me.

393
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,604
Mom, I don't want to do it.

394
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,231
I'm not doing it.

395
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,629
Jung Dong-seok, look at Mommy.

396
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,884
She's only doing that
because she doesn't know you.

397
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,471
You're the brightest
of all the gems in the world.

398
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,850
You haven't had practice
which is why nobody saw it.

399
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,643
That's why we're here to practice.

400
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:53,273
Let's go and show them
how great you are, okay?

401
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,108
No.

402
00:28:55,775 --> 00:29:00,488
She's always mean to me at school.

403
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,533
Which is why you should do this
so she doesn't do that.

404
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,245
If you run away now,
she's going to think you're a scaredy-cat.

405
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,913
Are you a scaredy-cat, Dong-seok?

406
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,545
How about we try it just for one day?

407
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,840
And if you don't like it, we can stop.

408
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,554
It's Mommy's wish.
Do you really not want to??

409
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,185
Dong-seok.

410
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,814
Thank you, Dong-seok.

411
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,816
Come on.

412
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,737
There's no need to be sad and cry.
Not over something like this.

413
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,003
Is Yu-bin okay?

414
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,431
Yes.

415
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,568
I felt really bad.

416
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,071
You know how competitive Yu-bin is.

417
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,616
Shouldn't we think objectively,
especially at a moment like this?

418
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,168
You think I don't know that much?

419
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,312
Does she have some dirt
on Chun-hui or something?

420
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,692
Hey! Jung Dong-seok!

421
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,158
You're really something else, aren't you?

422
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,328
How did you come up
with such an amazing blueprint?

423
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,331
Did you really come up with this?

424
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,920
You're so good.

425
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,632
Has Dong-seok tried making
a Rube Goldberg machine before?

426
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,385
-No, not really…
-Oh, really?

427
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,430
That's so strange.

428
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,392
He's showing a comprehension level
of a middle-schooler or higher.

429
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,144
He also knows about energy transfer.

430
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,732
If he's this good without having been
to academies, he's a genius.

431
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,109
-What's this?
-Dong-seok's remarkable.

432
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,993
-Mom.
-Yes?

433
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,536
My printouts and pencil case!

434
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,788
Printouts and pencil case?
Oh, it's on the desk.

435
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,500
All right.

436
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,378
Dong-ju, you need to eat well on your own
like your brother, okay?

437
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,172
And learn to use your chopsticks too.

438
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,423
-Let's go!
-Wait.

439
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,592
-We have to hurry.
-Oh, we're late!

440
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,218
Hurry up.

441
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,763
Dong-seok, do you have everything?

442
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,222
Oh, right. My shoe bag!

443
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,100
-I have all my stuff.
-You do? Put your backpack on.

444
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,352
-Let's go.
-Yes.

445
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,730
I'm going to make
a fruit basket out of clay today.

446
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,065
Here we go…

447
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,566
Good morning.

448
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,151
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

449
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,078
Spill the beans now. Where did he study?

450
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,789
We really haven't sent him anywhere.

451
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,459
That's not what it looked like though.

452
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,003
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

453
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,381
What are you going to do
at kindergarten today?

454
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,509
Me? I'm going to have lots of fun.

455
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,635
All right.

456
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,727
Eun-pyo.

457
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,653
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

458
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,406
-Good morning.
-Are you on your way to work?

459
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,824
Yes.

460
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,994
We should all have
a meal together with Yun-ju sometime.

461
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,870
Indeed.

462
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,706
-Is he our uncle?
-All right, then.

463
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,833
Bye.

464
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,757
You know Eun-pyo?

465
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,678
Oh, she's my wife's cousin.

466
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,725
You know her too?

467
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,685
Yes.

468
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,771
I see.

469
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,693
The bell rings, just like that.

470
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,194
What are dominos?

471
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,905
Gosh, you're so noisy.

472
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,783
Where does Su-in's father work?

473
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,995
Pharm de Lyon, a pharmaceutical company.

474
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,872
I see.

475
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,252
Has he been working there for a long time?

476
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,547
He used to work at a shop.

477
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,508
A shop?

478
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:17,305
Su-in's mother's side of the family runs
a sweet and spicy chicken shop in Incheon.

479
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,556
He worked in that area.

480
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,356
-Good morning.
-Bye, Mom.

481
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,400
-Good morning.
-Bye, Dong-seok!

482
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,443
-Bye.
-Bye.

483
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,653
-Hello.
-Good morning.

484
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,489
Good morning.

485
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,615
Chun-hui.

486
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,994
-Did you hear about Su-in?
-What?

487
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,788
She teamed up with Henry!

488
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,707
-What?
-I can't believe that woman.

489
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,959
I thought she was the one
who made all that fuss

490
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,504
about getting rid of
the class for gifted students.

491
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,590
Forget about winning.

492
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,425
Henry will probably win!

493
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,223
It's not over until it's over, no?

494
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,984
Su-in.

495
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,153
What could this be?

496
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,864
I can't figure it out.

497
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,784
You managed to find the place.

498
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,244
Oh, hello.

499
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,539
I can't believe there's such
a great place like this.

500
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,666
What is this place?

501
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,627
It's a place where my seniors
work with engineers.

502
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,755
Henry and his friends
come once a week to learn things.

503
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,676
With artists and engineers?

504
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,346
There's this thing called kinetic art

505
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,182
where art merges with science.

506
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,436
-Come this way.
-Yes.

507
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,067
Henry, you're doing great.

508
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,653
Try doing it over here like this as well.

509
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,155
Good.

510
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,782
Su-in, should we try pulling the pulley?

511
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,367
That's so cool.

512
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,453
This is the principle of
potential energy and a pulley.

513
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,455
-Let's try it together.
-Jin-ha.

514
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,667
Thanks to you,
I get to come to a fancy place like this.

515
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,794
I feel like I'm getting spoiled.

516
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,758
I really hope
we can make it to the finals.

517
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,637
To be honest,
I don't care about the trophy.

518
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,807
I just thought it'd be
a good experience for the kids.

519
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,602
But why not?

520
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,981
A Ministerial Prize from the contest
will look great on anyone's portfolio.

521
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,323
Eun-pyo's lucky she has
someone like you as her cousin.

522
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,283
Me?

523
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,495
Having such a bright person
by one's side is sure to bring happiness.

524
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,373
My goodness.

525
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,834
I've never been complimented
like that before.

526
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,214
Gosh, Eun-pyo's the only one
who doesn't realize it.

527
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,924
All she does is rag on me.

528
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,969
We should all meet up
and have a meal sometime.

529
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,472
I want the three of us to get close.

530
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,975
Yes, sure.

531
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:19,070
By the way, do you know what
Eun-pyo's husband does for work?

532
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,905
Oh…

533
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,576
She wouldn't be happy
if I talked about her husband.

534
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,538
The thing is…

535
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,874
nine years ago,

536
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,836
my uncle's paint shop burnt down

537
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,047
and he passed away.

538
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,345
It turned out one of my uncle's
friends got angry and started the fire.

539
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:49,058
Eun-pyo's husband was
the detective who was on that case.

540
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,527
Can I come in?

541
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,167
Is something the matter?

542
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,712
I wonder what it's like…

543
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,966
to lose parents that you love.

544
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,345
You know,

545
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,014
I'm…

546
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,728
I'm even jealous of that.

547
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,940
I'm going to be the first one
to make the Turtle Ship!

548
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:42,320
I'm going to protect
our country with the Turtle Ship!

549
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,530
I'm also going to protect our country!

550
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,533
Transforming back into turtle mode!

551
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,958
-Yes.
-Did the boys eat?

552
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,793
Transformation complete!

553
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,295
-Then, for me…
-Yes.

554
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,673
You're not giving them
junk food again, are you?

555
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,050
No.

556
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,845
Make sure to close the lids
of the side dishes tightly.

557
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,889
And no more TV for the boys.

558
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,893
Also, don't let Dong-ju eat
anything with peanuts in it, okay?

559
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,562
Okay, I got it.

560
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,689
When are you coming home?

561
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,068
I'll try to get back as early as I can.

562
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,570
Clean the house.
The kids will get hurt if they fall.

563
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,280
All right.

564
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,619
The bridge is complete!

565
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,831
I'm almost done!

566
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,459
MISSING CHILD RECORD CHART
JANG HYUN-SUNG

567
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,341
Is Jang Hyun-sung my birth name?

568
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,551
We're not sure.

569
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,011
It's not confirmed.

570
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,972
It's just something we received
from Daejeon Children's Home.

571
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,647
The title of the book is

572
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,900
An Adoptee, the Eternal Stranger.

573
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,072
The reasons why I'm writing this book…

574
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,907
First,

575
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,453
I want to help other adopted children
like me and give them hope.

576
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,081
Second,

577
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,378
I want to help my son
understand his father.

578
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,798
And finally…

579
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,885
I want to comfort my sister,

580
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,347
who's grieving the loss of her parents.

581
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:43,524
They said I refused to learn anything
about Korea when I was young.

582
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,279
They said whenever something
about Korea came up on TV,

583
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,699
I would yell at everyone not to watch it.

584
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,201
Why?

585
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,457
I think even as a boy, I was desperate
to integrate myself into France.

586
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,918
But…

587
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,755
when you first saw me, why…

588
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,467
Because then,

589
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,220
I wanted to become Korean again.

590
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,058
Are you Korean?

591
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,817
Are you not going to sleep?

592
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,654
No, I am.

593
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,909
This part-time job…

594
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,827
Does it pay well?

595
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,370
Why?

596
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,747
Well, the thing is…

597
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,001
I almost died taking care of
the boys all day.

598
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,629
They asked me to pick them up
and they wanted to wrestle.

599
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,089
I think I might have
dislocated my shoulder.

600
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,009
-Please. Don't be a baby. You're fine.
-It hurts here too.

601
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,886
Jeez, stop it.

602
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:58,098
But you still had a loving family.

603
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,935
You're right, I did.

604
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,604
But it was never mine to have.

605
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,027
-Oh. Wait up, please.
-Hang on.

606
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,994
Is it true

607
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:23,165
that you'll be entering
the Rube Goldberg contest?

608
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,584
Yes.

609
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,798
I'm really disappointed in you,
Henry's mother.

610
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,927
I thought you were against
the idea of ranking our children.

611
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,388
You put on such a show
saying all those moving words,

612
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:40,474
but now you're back to
that same rotten education system--

613
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,728
You seem to have rather fixed thoughts,
Jul-pin's mother.

614
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,313
Sorry?

615
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,358
I think you should think flexibly

616
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,944
as a wife of an artist.

617
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:55,030
That way you can inspire him.

618
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,284
Are you insinuating

619
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:02,538
that I'm someone
my husband can't communicate with?

620
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,207
My goodness.

621
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:11,797
I'm one of the few critics that
truly understand my husband's work and…

622
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,968
Well, then…

623
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,471
why don't we save
this talk for another time?

624
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,183
Goodbye.

625
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,317
Guys, slow down.

626
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,652
-Don't forget your materials for tomorrow!
-We're done!

627
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,362
Don't forget to bring
your things tomorrow.

628
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,488
Thank you, teacher.

629
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,656
Thank you.

630
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,700
The class is over

631
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,910
but Dong-seok doesn't seem
to want to leave.

632
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,246
-Bye.
-Bye, see you later.

633
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,041
-Thank you for everything.
-Hello, ma'am. See you tomorrow.

634
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,096
Dong-seok, can we go home now?

635
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,807
Dong-seok.

636
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,810
Let's go home, okay?

637
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,606
2022 RUBE GOLDBERG CONTEST
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE

638
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,154
ELEMENTARY
HANSEL AND GRETEL

639
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,747
-Chun-hui.
-Where are you going?

640
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,666
-Oh, you're here. Hello, teacher.
-Hello.

641
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,834
-Did you bring everything you need?
-Of course.

642
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,670
-Did the kids eat?
-No.

643
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,546
-Did you bring something?
-I brought gimbap and drinks.

644
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,507
Thank you. Where did you find the time?

645
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,967
Chew well.
You're going to get an upset stomach.

646
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,636
Is it good?

647
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,764
The other team is here.

648
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,516
What?

649
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,396
I wonder what materials they brought.

650
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,732
It would be nice
if someone could go take a peek.

651
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,276
I'm going to go to the bathroom…

652
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,154
I was asking you to go and look…

653
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:00,989
Eun-pyo.

654
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,753
-How have you been, Eun-pyo?
-Fine.

655
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,464
I teamed up with Yun-ju.

656
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,008
She seems like such a great person.

657
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,552
Does she?

658
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,139
I heard you're not moving.

659
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:29,017
Why didn't you tell me?

660
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:35,899
Does that mean there's a chance
for us to be close friends again?

661
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,409
Dong-seok's mom.

662
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,498
I can't seem to find
the cardboard cut-outs.

663
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,417
You were supposed to bring those, right?

664
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,421
Did you get everything?

665
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,298
Let's go.

666
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,764
Eun-pyo, how could you?

667
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,309
Where are you going to
find that right now?

668
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,060
You're so careless.

669
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,147
Okay, we have ten minutes left
so please make your way inside.

670
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,774
What do we do?

671
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,861
Do you know how hard we prepared for this?

672
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,238
It's over.

673
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,991
It's not over, don't cry.

674
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,129
Jin-ha.

675
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,174
Let's watch out for our team first.

676
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,769
Excuse me.

677
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:57,773
Is there anywhere around here
that might sell cardboard?

678
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,276
We don't provide
any materials to the participants.

679
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,197
Mom.

680
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,117
-Mom.
-Dong-seok, give me a second.

681
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,871
-Mom.
-Dong-seok, I'm busy right now.

682
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,790
It's not that.

683
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,418
-Can you rip off some of that for me?
-What?

684
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:22,881
If we use that, we don't need cardboard.

685
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,176
What?

686
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,140
Sorry, honey.

687
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,601
Sorry, Dong-ju.
Mommy will buy you another one.

688
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,812
It's okay, Dong-ju.

689
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,522
Mommy's going to buy you a new one.

690
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,357
-Mommy's sorry.
-I'm sorry.

691
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,503
What are you going to do?

692
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,965
You said that you'd be
responsible if anything happens.

693
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:07,509
So?

694
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,554
We're obviously not going to win.

695
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,889
Are you just going to let it slide?

696
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,228
You want me to pay you or something?

697
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,273
Why are you talking about money?

698
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:26,778
I'm saying maybe we should
exclude Dong-seok from our team now.

699
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:27,779
No.

700
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,531
You're getting kicked out first.

701
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,202
Chun-hui.

702
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:37,039
How dare you
let your anger out on your teammates?

703
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,250
The contest isn't over yet.

704
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,252
Are you lashing out
because you know the result?

705
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,587
Lashing out?

706
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,716
Why do you keep taking her side?

707
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,886
We've known each other for much longer!

708
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,890
Stop fighting, you two.

709
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,226
I'll leave the team.

710
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,730
It's only right that I leave.

711
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,525
I'm genuinely very sorry.

712
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,447
If it's monetary compensation you want,
I'll provide that as well.

713
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:14,117
Once again, I apologize.

714
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,332
Why is everyone talking about money?
Are you guys all rich?

715
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,084
Why don't you pay in installments?

716
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,552
Chun-hui.

717
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,784
Dong-seok's mom.

718
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:02,374
I thought you had some guts, but I guess
there's a lot you need to work on.

719
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,545
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

720
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,348
Raising a child

721
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,643
means you have to be bold
every step of the way.

722
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,355
There's no need to get
so discouraged over something like this.

723
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,528
You even made it through childbirth.

724
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,905
What's the big deal?

725
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:39,244
Just think of it as an experience
and put it behind you.

726
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,539
If the mom is intimidated,

727
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,042
the kids will be more intimidated.

728
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,885
Either way…

729
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,181
Even if we don't win the prize,

730
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:04,060
let's go to the sky garden
and have a glass of wine like last time.

731
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,866
-Okay, let's move on.
-Sure.

732
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,659
Don't you think we'll win?

733
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,244
They used the centrifugal force

734
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,580
generated by the funnel
to get the marble to drop.

735
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,124
-It's definitely creative.
-It's a great idea.

736
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,793
-Yes.
-You're right.

737
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,503
All right, should we give it a go?

738
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,568
For our Participation Prize,

739
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:57,322
congratulations to our third-grade team
from Uin Elementary, the Flying Turtles!

740
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,034
Could I please have everyone
come up on stage?

741
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:05,163
Judge Lee Sun-hwa
will be presenting the award.

742
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,290
The Participation Prize receives

743
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,751
-a prize money of 300,000 won!
-It's over.

744
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:13,672
If we didn't even win
the Participation Prize, it's over, right?

745
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,006
It's over.

746
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:16,967
And now

747
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,302
I'll be presenting
the Excellence Prize winners.

748
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,720
The Excellence Prize goes to…

749
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,348
Please.

750
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,398
The first graders from Sangwe
Elementary School, the Neverland team!

751
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,942
-We got it!
-We won!

752
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,991
Judge Jeon Jeong-il
will present the award.

753
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,827
The prize money
for the Excellence Prize is 500,000 won.

754
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,080
They did so great.

755
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:49,833
-Mom, let's go home.
-And now, it's time to present

756
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,210
-Okay, it'll be over soon.
-the Grand Prize,

757
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,713
-I'm hungry.
-which is given by

758
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,923
-Why did she bring her little one?
-the Ministry of Science.

759
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:01,344
Which team do you think
will win the Grand Prize?

760
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,848
The Grand Prize winner

761
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,309
for the 2022 Rube Goldberg
Elementary Competition is…

762
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,687
They're from the same school.

763
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,816
Congratulations to the Tiny Conquerors
from Sangwe Elementary School!

764
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:19,070
-What? It's our kids?
-Oh my gosh, that's my boy!

765
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:27,329
The Grand Prize will be presented
by our director, Mr. Jeong Seung-jun.

766
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,957
-The prize money is one million won!
-Mommy's right here!

767
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,753
Okay, one last round of applause please.

768
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,421
-Mom!
-My boy!

769
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,256
2022 RUBE GOLDBERG CONTEST
GRAND PRIZE, 1,000,000 WON

770
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,800
You did it!

771
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,385
Mom!

772
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:49,100
-Dong-seok, you did great.
-Well done.

773
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,478
Dong-ju, check this out.

774
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,481
You guys!
Congratulations on winning the prize.

775
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:58,777
Isn't Sangwe Elementary amazing?
We swept the major prizes today!

776
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,528
Are you having an after-party?

777
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,323
Of course. Everyone worked so hard.

778
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:07,035
How about we join you guys?

779
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:11,164
We can leave the kids with the husbands
and the moms can go have some fun.

780
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:13,166
Can we join too? Let's all go together.

781
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,585
All right. Let's all go.

782
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,337
Let's go.

783
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:18,797
Let's go.

784
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,341
Let's go.

785
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,929
Here's to Sangwe Elementary School!

786
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,442
So how did everyone meet their husband?

787
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,028
I want to hear it.

788
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,951
Me first?

789
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,711
I'm sorry.

790
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,964
I was thinking about when we used to date.

791
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,091
Well…

792
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:06,678
I'm not one to toot my own horn,

793
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,180
but even though I look like this now,

794
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,934
people used to tell me
how pretty I was back when I was young.

795
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:18,189
So, that's probably
how I caught Su-in's father's attention.

796
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,780
Hello.

797
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,050
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

798
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,844
It's hot, isn't it? Here, have this.

799
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,846
Oh, thank you.

800
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,434
What is this?

801
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:03,610
When I used to work in a pharmacy,
a new salesman

802
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:07,405
was assigned to our store
and kept sneaking me presents

803
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,657
and buying me things to eat.

804
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,119
Hello?

805
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,663
Mr. Lee Man-su?

806
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,541
I'm calling from Dongdo Pharmacy.

807
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,506
You didn't have…

808
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,716
any plans for tonight?

809
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,717
No.

810
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,806
I can help you with that.

811
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,557
No, it's fine I can…

812
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,692
And then one day, despite me saying no,

813
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:48,279
he stayed after work
just to help me organize the inventory…

814
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,781
-Oh, no!
-Oh, my!

815
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,839
COME IN FOR A SESSION
COUNSELLING ROOM

816
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,007
And he just wouldn't send me home!

817
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,177
I never made it home that night!

818
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,516
So ever since that day…

819
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,103
All right, that's it.

820
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,855
Who's next?

821
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,022
Who's turn is it?

822
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,860
Jin-ha, how did you meet your husband?

823
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,904
Eun-pyo introduced me to him.

824
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:36,327
I wasn't interested in dating,

825
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,247
but she urged me to meet him.

826
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,377
I think she felt bad
because I looked so lonely.

827
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,045
I did?

828
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,090
That's what you said.

829
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,926
You said he was a good guy
and that I should meet him.

830
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,178
There's no…

831
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,391
Did I?

832
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:07,150
How did you meet Dong-seok's father?

833
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,114
Well…

834
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,372
It was a blind date.

835
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,513
What does Dong-seok's father
do for a living?

836
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,599
Well…

837
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,309
He just…

838
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:44,646
He just works at a small company.

839
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,857
I guess your in-laws must be well off.

840
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:51,110
-No.
-Of course, they are.

841
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,405
Her mother-in-law practically
gave her their current house.

842
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,782
-Hey.
-I'm right, though.

843
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,492
-Really?
-Yes.

844
00:58:57,575 --> 00:59:00,954
Look at you. You're married to a rich guy.

845
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,914
The second round is on you.

846
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:03,998
Oh, please.

847
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,241
Cheers!

848
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,168
-Where are you going?
-I don't know!

849
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,795
Gosh, what's gotten into her?

850
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,463
Oh, dear.

851
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,966
She's going out there again.

852
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,467
You have to empty your glass.

853
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,219
-Okay.
-Are you going to waste this?

854
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,975
I'm playing catch-up here.

855
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,019
Where did you learn to dance like that?

856
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,187
You're so much better.

857
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,565
-I've always been a dancer.
-Oh, really?

858
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:15,445
-My gosh, she went up there.
-Oh, no.

859
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:18,781
She looks like a yellow baby chick.

860
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,245
Hey!

861
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,498
-Hey!
-Goodness me.

862
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,542
-Oh, no!
-Get up!

863
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,462
Oh, no. She drank way too much.

864
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,422
Wake up, Jin-ha.

865
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,262
Guys, the taxi's here!

866
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,723
-Okay, let's do this.
-Wait.

867
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,892
I'll take Chun-hui home, and you can take…

868
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,144
All right. Come on, Chun-hui.

869
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,437
Oh, please. Come on.

870
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,064
Hey!

871
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,447
Hey!

872
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,497
To be honest…

873
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,666
I…

874
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,294
I think it's a miracle.

875
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,173
How could a daughter
like that come out of me?

876
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,342
She's smart.

877
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,220
She has a big heart

878
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,138
and she's good at studying.

879
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,266
You know,

880
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,228
I'll do whatever it takes

881
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:35,274
to make sure Su-in
does whatever she wants.

882
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,403
I'll make sure
she does everything she wants.

883
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:43,366
Su-in's father is going to
break his back to support all that.

884
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,750
What a pitiful life.

885
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:09,016
Jin-ha's pretty drunk.

886
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,230
No!

887
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:17,775
I want Eun-pyo to help me.
Take me home, Eun-pyo.

888
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,235
Eun-pyo…

889
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,287
Jin-ha, right here.

890
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,336
You know…

891
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:44,677
how much I like you, right?

892
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,973
Eun-pyo.

893
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,145
You and I…

894
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,649
are back on good terms now, okay?

895
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,780
I left a change of clothes by the door.

896
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:28,865
I'll go now.

897
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:50,863
How about you write the introduction
for my exhibition, Eun-pyo?

898
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,365
There's no point in doing it.

899
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,076
There's someone
I want to introduce you to.

900
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:57,870
I shouldn't have bought this…

901
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,915
Is this Ms. Byeon Chun-hui's…
Chun-hui, is that you?

902
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:04,293
Don't get involved in my life in any way.

903
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,046
I always thought I was the weird one.

904
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,422
You don't like me.

905
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,383
Don't ever contact me again.

906
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:14,053
I think I might be too selfish
and weak to be a mother.

907
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,930
I'm not qualified to be one.

908
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:19,433
I want to know why you left me

909
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,018
for Jin-ha back then.

910
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:23,771
Why are you here?

911
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:30,653
