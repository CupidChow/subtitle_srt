1
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,783
What are you here for?

2
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,371
Mom, does he not like me too?

3
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:25,001
No, Dong-seok has just gotten really shy.

4
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,796
He sometimes can't speak at all
even if he wants to.

5
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,007
It's not because he doesn't like you,
so let's understand him, okay?

6
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,854
Hey, wait for me!

7
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,361
Yu-bin looks so excited
for the first time in a while.

8
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,659
She's been down lately.

9
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,664
She's been anxious because she thought
I've been keeping a close eye on her.

10
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,751
And not going to her academy classes
has been making her nervous too.

11
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,797
She stopped going to her academy
for quite some time.

12
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,592
I don't think studying
is her top priority right now.

13
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,401
We came to see a doctor
because Yu-bin kept on lying.

14
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,533
When I scolded her, she started crying
and said she didn't know either.

15
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,327
Then slowly…

16
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,456
she started to believe in her own lies.

17
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,795
That's when I realized

18
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,841
something's gone terribly wrong.

19
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,221
I thought

20
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,852
raising children was all about
standing firm and being strong.

21
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,857
But it turns out that was just hubris.

22
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,528
Nothing turns out the way I want it to.

23
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,665
They said Dong-seok has selective mutism.

24
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,502
I must've…

25
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,547
given him too much stress.

26
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,801
I was so excited
when I learned how smart he was

27
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,762
and ended up pushing him so hard.

28
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,558
I wanted to crush everyone
who used to make fun of my boy.

29
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,686
I never realized
that he was festering on the inside.

30
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,111
Don't you now get

31
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:02,116
why adults say that raising a child
is the most difficult job in the world?

32
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,246
You and I both…

33
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,332
are learning things the hard way.

34
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,896
EPISODE 12: CAN ADULTS BECOME FRIENDS
WITHOUT MOTIVES TOO?

35
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,816
Don't just play video games
at home just because it's winter.

36
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,860
Make sure to exercise
and don't forget to study either.

37
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,279
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

38
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,155
All right, let's pack our bags.

39
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,699
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

40
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,618
I'll see you again after the break.

41
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,787
-Okay!
-Okay!

42
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,792
Yes, I was the bully in high school!

43
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,129
-Really?
-Yes, but it's not like I did bad things

44
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,923
or take money from other kids.
I just knew how to fight.

45
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,966
Seriously?

46
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,843
-Really?
-Is that true?

47
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,927
Ladies, look.

48
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,972
My gosh, what is that?

49
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,682
-She's not joking.
-Well…

50
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,933
Are you for real?

51
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:13,229
There used to be a group of girls called
"Bond Girl" in the school next to ours.

52
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,357
It's a battle scar from
when the two gangs duked it out.

53
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,486
And get this, it was 17 on 2.

54
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,031
-What? 17?
-Please, I don't believe it.

55
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,616
-I wasn't part of the 17. I was the 2!
-Gosh, please.

56
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,202
-You sure it wasn't seven on two?
-You don't believe me?

57
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,330
-No, we don't.
-I swear!

58
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,290
-You were the two?
-I was the two!

59
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,958
Are you serious?

60
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,629
I'm serious. So then I was like…

61
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,632
That school bully.

62
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,678
Does she think being a bully
in the past is something to brag about?

63
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,221
She has no decency.

64
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,766
I know, right?

65
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,685
Why are they even interested in her?

66
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,315
Then who wants to be
the leader of my fan club?

67
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,232
Let me do it.

68
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,652
But honestly, you were quite wild
back then too, weren't you?

69
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,281
You used all kinds of
wild swear words the other day.

70
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,783
Gosh, what?

71
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,452
Hey, if someone is insulting me,
that would piss me off

72
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,245
and I would want to fight back.

73
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,831
I was so shocked that I don't even
remember anything from that day.

74
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,751
But when you spoke in a dialect,

75
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,294
it did come off pretty strong.

76
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,463
Dialect?

77
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,175
Are you prejudiced against people
from the countryside?

78
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,677
You're basically being racist,
do you know that?

79
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,013
-When was I ever racist?
-Yes, I wasn't squeaky clean.

80
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,474
I ranked in the top-tier
university entrance exams in my province.

81
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,101
What did you rank on your exams in Seoul?

82
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,400
Eun-pyo, aren't you coming today?

83
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:45,029
No, we were planning to go,
but he got scared.

84
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:49,033
It's going to be the last time everyone in
their class gets together for a playdate.

85
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,704
It must be rough to make him lunch
separately every day.

86
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,749
I don't even know what to make him.

87
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,550
Hey, did the class president go?

88
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,717
Byeon Chun-hui?

89
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,596
Eun-pyo, she hasn't shown up
to places like this in a while.

90
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,351
Jeez, we all voted her, but she's not
even organizing the meet-ups.

91
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,354
Why do you ask?

92
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,358
I was just asking.

93
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:45,047
Chun-hui, I'm making
fried rice omelet right now.

94
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,884
Do you want to come over
if you haven't had lunch yet?

95
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,026
Sounds great.

96
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,115
You go up the stairs like this
and collect the coins.

97
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,076
Then you can use those coins
to buy new characters.

98
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,119
Got it?

99
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,333
By the way,

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,836
why haven't you been saying
anything this entire time?

101
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,215
Oh, he said it's hard
for him to talk sometimes.

102
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,800
It's like how I have
a hard time not telling lies.

103
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,511
It's similar to that.

104
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,720
I see.

105
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,391
Anyway, so if you go up like this,
you'll get to 600.

106
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,060
At 600, you get the spaceship…

107
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,366
It would've been a simple lunch for you,

108
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,618
but it turned into
a big thing because of us.

109
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,621
It's fine. Food tastes better
when everyone shares.

110
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,625
Plus, it's the first day of winter break
and I feel bad for the kids.

111
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,465
Guys, let's all have this
before we have lunch.

112
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,217
-Okay.
-Here you go.

113
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,553
-Don't forget to say thank you.
-Thank you.

114
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,971
-Here.
-Thank you.

115
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,139
-Here, Dong-ju.
-Thank you.

116
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,436
You guys are eating so well.

117
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,980
Eat as much as you want.

118
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,106
-Okay.
-Okay.

119
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,948
Thanks for the meal.

120
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,951
Oh, that's right.

121
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,162
Let's try the wine you brought.

122
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,969
Cheers.

123
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,934
This is delicious!

124
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,190
Don't drink too much of it though.

125
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,110
You're a lot to handle when you get drunk.

126
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,864
Mom, it tastes so good.

127
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,616
The sausage is really good, too.

128
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,783
-You like it?
-Yes.

129
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,285
-Eat as much as you want.
-Okay.

130
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,710
Eun-pyo is having a hard time
because she feels so bad for him.

131
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,629
But Dong-seok is not getting any better.

132
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,674
It's rough.

133
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,178
Don't worry, Jae-ung.

134
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,431
Kids get sick and then get better
in just one day

135
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,807
like nothing happened.

136
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,978
Also, kids that give their parents
a rough time turn out better.

137
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,898
How do you know so well
when you don't even have a kid?

138
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,026
Why wouldn't I know? I'm living proof.

139
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,154
My mom used to pray every day
so that I wouldn't become a gangster.

140
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,074
And look at me now.
I'm a government employee.

141
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,035
Gangsters and detectives
aren't that different though.

142
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,954
Your mom never knew that, did she?

143
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,625
-Don't you dare talk about my mom.
-I'm right, though.

144
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,168
You're a total gangster
when you catch bad guys.

145
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,171
At least I don't look like a gangster.
Whatever, forget about it.

146
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,094
Right.

147
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,888
Did you ever check up on that thing?

148
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,932
Oh, that lady?

149
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,226
She works at Red Sun in Daewe-dong.

150
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,520
And there's definitely
something fishy going on.

151
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,648
She was questioned by the police
for some drug charges a while ago.

152
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,235
But she tested clean,
so they just let her go with a warning.

153
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,236
When was that?

154
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,947
It was two years ago
when the joint task force was formed.

155
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,865
They did shake down the entire network.

156
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,786
But it's possible that they have
a new supply chain in place by now.

157
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,456
I told you. I got blackout drunk
and fell down the stairs.

158
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,668
Then why did you run away
instead of getting patched up?

159
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,379
Because the punk I was drinking with
threatened to kill me

160
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,005
and came to the emergency room.

161
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,425
Would it hurt less
if I get stabbed in the emergency room?

162
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,218
Who gave you a ride to the hospital?

163
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,054
Someone who worked there.

164
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,932
A coworker who worked the rooms with you?

165
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,935
Sure, maybe?

166
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,312
I don't really remember.

167
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,857
Why are you guys asking me
all these stupid questions?

168
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,567
Is it a crime that I didn't stay
and get treated?

169
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,237
Ms. Shin.

170
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,157
We're not after the people

171
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,076
who took the drugs.

172
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,328
We're looking for the sellers.

173
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,373
I think you know what I'm talking about.

174
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,126
Sellers are never the type of people
who want to lose track

175
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,211
of their customers.

176
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,338
All right.

177
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,132
Please mull it over.

178
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,010
I hope you make the right decision.

179
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,303
JUNG JAE-UNG

180
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,018
Have a good day.

181
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,982
Go ahead

182
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,486
and investigate everyone
related to that girl.

183
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,862
Yes, sir.

184
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,130
What?

185
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,256
Won-tae!

186
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,258
The cops were just here.

187
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,928
They asked all sorts of questions.

188
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,013
What exactly did they ask you?

189
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,517
They said to call them because they're
after the sellers, not the buyers.

190
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,269
Darn it.

191
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,148
You didn't say anything stupid, did you?

192
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,775
Are you insane?

193
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,068
Hello.

194
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,361
Sit tight for now.

195
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,700
Damn it, you're lucky
I don't stomp you out right now.

196
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,743
Hey.

197
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,496
Hey! Clean that up.

198
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,125
So what do you want?

199
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,252
Well…

200
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:02,049
I was just wondering what you thought
of laying low for a little while.

201
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,469
-Won-tae.
-Yes, sir.

202
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,846
Is it that hard to get some product?

203
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,806
Sorry?

204
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,352
All I asked you was to get a new supplier

205
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,521
so I could write off
the rest of your debt.

206
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,650
Why the hell are you talking about
what the cops are up to?

207
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,985
Wait.

208
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,822
Are you trying to pull a fast one on me
to try and wriggle your way out of this?

209
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,204
I would never do anything like that.

210
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,458
Then why are you trying
to get out of this?

211
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,420
It's the girl that keeps
coming up with all these excuses.

212
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,213
Jeez, this punk…

213
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,967
How did you manage to
prey on girls when you're like this?

214
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,470
What do you have your brain for?

215
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,556
She has a lot to lose.

216
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,558
What do you think would scare her most?

217
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,312
Your very existence
is the most damage to her.

218
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,773
Are you still not getting it?

219
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,191
I am.

220
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,444
Don't just call her.

221
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,613
Go out there and make things happen.

222
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,864
Yes, sir.

223
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,911
If you're done,
then get going, Mr. Won-tae.

224
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,829
Yes, sir. I'll get going.

225
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,998
Is that as fast as you can run?

226
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,502
Mom, when you spin around really fast,

227
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,880
the crystals on the skirt
sparkle like crazy.

228
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,341
It's so pretty when that happens.

229
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,053
So can you buy one of those tutus for me?

230
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,890
I want one that has even more sparkly
beads than the one that Seo-hyeon has.

231
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,393
Is ballet really that fun?
You literally started learning it.

232
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,189
Yes, of course. I get to be pretty like
a princess and it's healthy for me too.

233
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,609
How about you, Yeong-bin?
Do you like your orchestra class?

234
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,735
It's fun.

235
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:48,364
If I'm lucky, I might even get to play
a solo pretty soon.

236
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,698
Really?

237
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,826
When did you get so good?
I didn't even know.

238
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,120
Let's hurry up guys.

239
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,997
I'll cook something delicious for you.

240
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,791
Okay.

241
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,337
Yeong-bin really likes playing the violin.

242
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,923
Mom, I like the violin too.

243
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,342
I know you like it too.

244
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,930
You're not going to light that, are you?

245
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,391
You're not trying to
smoke that here, right?

246
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,392
What is it, Mom?

247
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,024
Mom…

248
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,486
And this is a non-smoking area,
so you can't smoke here.

249
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,196
That's all.

250
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,949
-I won't light it then.
-Good.

251
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,538
Put that in your pocket.
You can't smoke here.

252
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,831
I said I won't.

253
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,041
Damn it.

254
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,811
Enjoy.

255
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,107
You can cut it
on your own, right Yeong-bin?

256
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,025
Yes.

257
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,651
I'll cut it for you Yu-bin.

258
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,617
Where are you, girl?

259
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,665
Aren't you coming home today?

260
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,044
Yu-bin, eat up.

261
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,796
Thank you for this meal.

262
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,849
Why are you ignoring my calls?

263
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,478
Is this really how you're going to be?

264
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,485
Should I just go talk
to your old man directly?

265
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,797
I'm on a trip.

266
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,965
I'll call you later.

267
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,443
Mom, where are we going now?

268
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,486
Right…

269
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,407
We're going on a trip.

270
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,160
Then why did we go grocery shopping?

271
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,289
Because we're camping.

272
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,999
Really? No way.

273
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,584
Wake up, Yeong-bin.

274
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,879
Mom said we're going camping.
Aren't you excited?

275
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,297
-Really?
-Yes.

276
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,842
But why are we going camping
all of a sudden?

277
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,303
I don't know. That's what mom said.

278
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,529
Hurry up and eat, Yu-bin.

279
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,409
Eat up.

280
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,410
Okay.

281
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,840
28 MISSED CALLS
17 UNREAD TEXT MESSAGES

282
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,853
The plane is now landing.

283
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,815
Dong-ju, I'm worried you might
spill your milk on the couch.

284
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,735
Oh gosh.

285
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,948
It's okay, we can wipe it up like this.

286
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,993
Mom, we're on winter break,
but how come we're not going anywhere?

287
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,621
We'll go when your dad
gets some time off of work, okay?

288
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,540
When's that?

289
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,918
Dong-seok never plays with me.

290
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,720
Hey, Chun-hui.

291
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,805
Hey.

292
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,348
What are you up to?

293
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,892
I'm just at home.

294
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:09,810
What's up?

295
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,311
Well…

296
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,816
If you're not busy,
do you want to come here and join us?

297
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,943
Where's that?

298
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:22,072
We're at a campsite in Gapyeong.

299
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,158
If it's possible,

300
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:30,330
could you also grab my down jacket,
some underwear for the kids,

301
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,375
and a phone charger from my place?

302
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,211
What do you say?

303
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,983
Mom, we made snowmen!

304
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,611
Be careful.

305
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,779
Okay.

306
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,365
-You did such a good job.
-Right?

307
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,913
We made snowmen
for everyone in our family.

308
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,464
Mom, is Dong-seok's family
not going to join us?

309
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,548
Well…

310
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,011
I'm not too sure. Maybe something came up.

311
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,306
That's Dong-seok!

312
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,475
Dong-seok!

313
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,482
-Hey, guys.
-Hello.

314
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,691
Hello.

315
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,779
-Hey.
-Hey, Dong-ju.

316
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,696
Hello.

317
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,407
We already made some snowmen,
but let's go make it again.

318
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,742
You came.

319
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,577
Hello.

320
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,330
Hey.

321
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,499
We put them over there.

322
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,959
What's with the camping all of a sudden?

323
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,128
I just needed some fresh air.

324
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,256
You can't be dressed like that
in a place like this.

325
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,342
Thanks.

326
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:11,306
It was a spur of the moment thing,
so I really didn't come prepared at all.

327
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,893
I never knew you had that kind of side.

328
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,730
-Thanks for coming.
-Don't mention it.

329
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,692
The boys were on the verge of
being really bored.

330
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,530
Gosh, it's so nice out here.

331
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,157
And the air is so fresh too.

332
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,911
-We're right over there.
-Oh, right over there?

333
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,163
The kids are going to love it here.

334
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,498
It's so white.

335
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,626
Be careful.

336
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,426
Careful, kids.

337
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,514
Watch your step, guys.
Follow Dong-seok and don't run.

338
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,506
But why did you ask us to come

339
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,300
instead of coming with their dad?

340
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,094
I see.

341
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,470
You guys fought, right?

342
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,389
No.

343
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:01,059
We never really do
a lot of things together.

344
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,728
We kind of stick to our responsibilities.

345
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,021
You're kidding.

346
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:09,025
Every time I've seen him,
he looks like such a kind man.

347
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,283
I guess he's just good
at selling that image.

348
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:24,541
I guess things have a way
of turning out like that as life goes on.

349
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,336
Everyone focuses on their own work,
so they don't burden the other one.

350
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,921
I once heard someone say

351
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,175
that you should never tell your husband
about your hopes and dreams.

352
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,636
Why is that?

353
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,848
Because he's not interested
in them in the slightest.

354
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,935
Gosh.

355
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,324
How did the two of you meet?

356
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,039
I never told you?

357
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,542
No one told you anything either?

358
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,257
Well…

359
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,513
I wanted to get married to a doctor,
so I asked someone to introduce me to one.

360
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,307
You know I'm a materialistic person.

361
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:25,894
So…

362
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,231
there never was any spark
or anything between us.

363
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,861
We just got married because there wasn't
anything wrong with either of us.

364
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,155
That's why we're still not that close.

365
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,698
Unlike you guys.

366
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,535
Please, we fight all the time too.

367
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,954
Detectives' wives
have all kinds of gripes.

368
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,374
They always work overtime
or have to stay overnight.

369
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,167
That's still a good thing.

370
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,254
You're in a healthy relationship
if you're upset that he's not coming home.

371
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,940
I recently…

372
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:17,070
went over to Jin-ha's place

373
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,825
because Dong-seok
said that he missed Henry.

374
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,204
I think there was a lot

375
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,666
that I misunderstood about her.

376
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,628
Jin-ha really meant it
when she said she liked me.

377
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,798
But because of
my twisted inferiority complex,

378
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:42,470
I could never see her true feelings.

379
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,935
I think maybe…

380
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,814
I might've been doing
the same thing to you.

381
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,066
Maybe I had

382
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,987
such a distorted view of things
that I couldn't see anything properly.

383
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:06,202
That's what's been on my mind lately.

384
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,622
No.

385
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,335
The only person who couldn't see
anything properly…

386
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,796
was me.

387
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,883
My anxiety and greed

388
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,969
are what got you into all that trouble.

389
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,722
I was aware of it,

390
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,560
but I didn't have the courage
to set things straight. I'm sorry.

391
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,201
But the thing is,

392
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,622
I'm still scared.

393
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,420
I'm scared that it might've been me
that made Jin-ha kill herself.

394
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,259
I'm scared that it might've been
those last scathing words

395
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,847
that I threw at her
that pushed her over the edge.

396
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,560
I keep trying to forget it.

397
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,733
But I don't think it'll ever go anywhere.

398
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,701
With that being said…

399
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,164
Do you think

400
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,960
you can tell me what happened

401
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,630
that night?

402
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,135
I want you to come over right now!

403
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,347
I haven't slept in three days.

404
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,432
It's not even that far.
Why can't you come?

405
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,142
Why are you acting like this?

406
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,688
-I told you I don't do that anymore.
-No, you have to come over right now!

407
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,065
Or I'm going to call the cops.

408
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:02,652
I'm going to tell everyone that
I saw you and Su-in's father at a hotel.

409
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:07,073
So you better come over right now!

410
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,452
Eun-pyo, the thing is…

411
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,210
In life,

412
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,424
knowing the truth
can be like poison sometimes.

413
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:29,262
It can be better to live your life
without knowing the whole story.

414
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,141
The one thing

415
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,896
I can tell you…

416
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,821
is that it wasn't because of you.

417
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,491
That's one thing you should know.

418
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,635
Chun-hui, are you sleeping?

419
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,263
No, why?

420
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,352
Thanks for inviting us today.

421
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,565
Don't mention it.

422
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,486
Honestly,

423
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:31,491
things are starting to
fade little by little.

424
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,620
It felt like things were bound to get
better someday, but at the same time,

425
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,164
I wondered when

426
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,668
and if it would even be possible.

427
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,214
Thanks to you,
I was able to forget about everything

428
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,424
and enjoy myself today like before.

429
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:57,684
How can our paths
be so intertwined like this?

430
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,939
Even after going through
all those things together,

431
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,358
we're right here next to each other.

432
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,027
I know, right?

433
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,198
Your existence

434
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,994
is the biggest comfort to me
than anyone else's.

435
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,372
I'm really bad, aren't I?

436
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,917
No.

437
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,753
I feel the same way.

438
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,091
Good night, Chun-hui.

439
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:31,884
Good night.

440
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,711
Chun-hui, did the kids say
there were going somewhere?

441
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,466
They're probably playing out
in the front or something.

442
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,078
Dong-seok!

443
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,330
Dong-ju!

444
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,208
Yu-bin!

445
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,794
Yeong-bin!

446
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,313
Where did they go?

447
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,371
Excuse me, did you happen to see
four kids passing by?

448
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,331
-No, I didn't see anyone.
-I see.

449
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:35,675
Excuse me, did you happen to see
four kids walking together?

450
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:36,968
-Did you see anything?
-No.

451
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,011
-We haven't seen any kids.
-Yes, we haven't.

452
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,138
Thank you.

453
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,025
Hey.

454
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,903
Chun-hui, are the kids back?

455
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,822
They're not there?

456
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,449
Okay, I'll start looking around.

457
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,034
-Okay.
-All right.

458
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,039
Enjoy your food.

459
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,458
-The fishcakes taste really good.
-Does it?

460
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,960
I'm going to have another one.

461
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,462
-Can I have more soup, please?
-All right.

462
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,755
Here you go.

463
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,090
-Thank you.
-Yes.

464
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,676
What are you kids doing here?

465
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,262
-Are you their mother?
-Yes.

466
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:25,683
The kids were just staring at us,
so I figured we should invite them in

467
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,518
to have a bite to eat.

468
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,936
Oh, dear…

469
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,480
Were you worried that you lost them?

470
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,775
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine.

471
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,569
Come here right now.

472
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,862
Quickly!

473
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,991
-I've been looking all over for you.
-Guys, your mom's here.

474
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,452
-Thank you.
-Bye, guys.

475
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,703
-Thank you.
-Bye.

476
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,413
-Bye.
-Bye, kids.

477
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,915
You should've told me
where you were going.

478
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,666
Bye, guys.

479
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,045
Guys. Where in the world did you go?

480
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,672
They walked over to another campsite

481
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,217
to get a bite to eat
because we were still sleeping.

482
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,178
Gosh, you should've woken us up.

483
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,346
Kim Yeong-bin!

484
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,598
You're the oldest one here.

485
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,017
You should've told me
where you were going.

486
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,143
I was so scared!

487
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,812
-Hurry up, let's go.
-Let's go.

488
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,189
It's time to head home.

489
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,193
They said we just need to
put this stuff inside the tent.

490
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,194
Okay.

491
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:23,783
Mom, I can't breathe too well.

492
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:25,952
What?

493
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,330
Since when?

494
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,291
Dong-ju, what did you eat?

495
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,672
What did you eat?

496
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,549
I told you not to go around
eating candy from strangers.

497
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,887
Yu-bin, where did you get this?

498
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,139
The lady from the other tent

499
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,809
gave it to us to eat.

500
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,394
Did Dong-ju have one of these?

501
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,478
Yes.

502
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,233
Does Dong-ju have a nut allergy?

503
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,234
Yes.

504
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,653
It's the macarons!

505
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,905
The main ingredient
in macarons is almonds!

506
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,824
Oh, no. Dong-ju!

507
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,367
-Dong-ju, are you okay?
-Dong-ju.

508
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,618
What do we do?

509
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,371
-Did you bring a Jext pen?
-Yes.

510
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,498
Dong-ju, it's going to be okay.

511
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,500
Dong-ju, it's going to be okay, all right?

512
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,169
Don't cry guys, it's going to be okay.

513
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,671
It's okay, Dong-ju.

514
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,965
I switched bags before I came.

515
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,050
What do I do?

516
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,470
-What do we do?
-What do I do?

517
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,638
Call 911.

518
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,390
-Everyone, we have to get to the hospital!
-Dong-ju!

519
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,558
Dong-ju!

520
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,854
Hello, is this 911?

521
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,732
We're located at
Healing Moonlight Camping Grounds,

522
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:41,152
and my son is having an allergic reaction
and is having trouble breathing.

523
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,945
Please send an ambulance
as fast as you can.

524
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,705
How fast can you get here?

525
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,206
The campground is far from here.

526
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,417
-So it'll probably take about 20 minutes.
-No.

527
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,878
My kid might die
if he has to wait that long.

528
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,185
What's going on?

529
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:32,244
-Okay, just hold on.
-Let's call the insurance company first.

530
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,748
-Jeez, don't talk nonsense.
-It wasn't my fault, okay?

531
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,375
There's an accident ahead of us.

532
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,585
I don't think
you'll be able to take this road.

533
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,212
Are there any detours we can take?

534
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,224
If you head back,
it's nothing but mountains.

535
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,559
You have to make it
to the bottom of the mountain.

536
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,271
Dong-ju.

537
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,941
Dong-ju! You have to stay with me.

538
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,818
Wake up, Dong-ju!

539
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,821
Chun-hui, what do we do? Dong-ju, wake up!

540
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,364
What do we do? Dong-ju, wake up!

541
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,032
What are we going to do?

542
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,494
Dong-ju, wake up!

543
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,662
Dong-ju!

544
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,206
Chun-hui, what are we going to do?

545
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,792
Dong-ju! What are we going to do?

546
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,007
Dong-ju!

547
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,093
Chun-hui!

548
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,763
Why are you parking the car?

549
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,182
Chun-hui!

550
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,600
Chun-hui!

551
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,687
Dong-ju, you have to stay with me!

552
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,107
-Get out of the car right now.
-What are you doing?

553
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:48,779
You have to stay awake, Dong-ju!

554
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,833
Dong-ju!

555
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,335
Please stay awake, Dong-ju!

556
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,380
Dong-ju. What do I do?

557
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,466
Gosh, what do I do? Dong-ju!

558
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:12,845
Dong-ju, look at Mommy.

559
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,639
-Dong-ju.
-Hurry and get out of the car!

560
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,155
Dong-ju.

561
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,374
Dong-ju…

562
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,739
Dong-ju.

563
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,575
Are you okay, Dong-ju?

564
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,178
Have a small snack.

565
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,936
HE COLLIDES WITH THE HIKER

566
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:44,979
Thank you.

567
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,286
What is it?
Is there something you want to say?

568
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,537
No.

569
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,331
There's just so much dust here.

570
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,709
Goodness.

571
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,089
Why haven't you been going to
Sangkemo these days?

572
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,048
Well…

573
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,553
We just picked a new leader
for the seventh term,

574
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,389
so all I have to do
is sit in as an advisor.

575
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:23,058
I also figured

576
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,477
that I've been neglecting you lately.

577
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,188
You also need to focus on
writing your script.

578
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,235
I told you I didn't want to succeed
with the sacrifice of others.

579
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,406
I don't need anything from you,
so let's just focus on our own lives.

580
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,074
Sure.

581
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,716
HIKER: IT’S FINE. DO YOU LIKE CANDY?

582
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,386
Gosh, my head.

583
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,515
LIKE I WAS NEVER HERE AT ALL
SCREENPLAY AND DIRECTOR: OH GEON-U

584
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,326
SAVE

585
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,790
SHUTTING DOWN

586
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:36,006
-Are you leaving, Geon-u?
-Yes, I'm going to be late.

587
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,092
I'm having a meeting with the actors,
so I'll be having some drinks too.

588
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,885
Which actors?

589
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,011
Song Hae-seon.

590
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,347
My goodness.

591
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,932
I hope it goes well.

592
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,102
If they want to meet up in person,
it has to be a good sign, right?

593
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,019
One second.

594
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,902
I wonder if she'll be able to truly grasp

595
00:44:56,985 --> 00:45:00,447
the profundity of your creative world.

596
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,698
Have a good meeting.

597
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,411
Yeong-mi.

598
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,915
I've been really
sensitive lately, haven't I?

599
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,670
I'll be back.

600
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,473
SWIPE THE VIDEO TO FAST-FORWARD OR REWIND

601
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,911
WELCOME

602
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,712
SCRIPT

603
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,476
Jin-ha?

604
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,919
EMERGENCY ROOM

605
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,515
Thank you, Chun-hui.

606
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,476
For saving Dong-ju.

607
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,900
I used to be a nurse.

608
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,196
But I never told anyone.

609
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,534
I didn't want people to gossip about it.

610
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,540
A doctor and nurse…

611
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,794
It's obvious what people would talk about.

612
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:08,176
I hesitated back there
because I didn't want you to find out.

613
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,307
But that almost got Dong-ju killed.

614
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,017
So you don't have to thank me.

615
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,437
No, I'll be thankful to you
for the rest of my life.

616
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:25,068
That's already twice now
that you've saved Dong-ju's life.

617
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:27,946
Eun-pyo.

618
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,823
What happened?

619
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,533
Is Dong-ju okay?

620
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,243
Yes, he's okay.

621
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,079
How did he end up eating peanuts?

622
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,081
And why didn't you tell me
you went on a trip so far out?

623
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,416
Do you know how shocked I was?

624
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,380
Hello.

625
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,886
I'm going to head out first.

626
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,472
Okay. Thank you, Chun-hui.

627
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:57,142
It's not like I did anything.

628
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,734
I'll see you back in Seoul.

629
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,627
Get inside.

630
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,801
Why aren't you going inside?

631
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:29,317
Are you now bringing
gangsters into our house?

632
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,904
How much do you owe them?

633
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,574
How much do you owe them

634
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,326
for gangsters to come to our house?

635
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,203
Quiet down, damn it.

636
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,289
How can I calm down
in a situation like this?

637
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,918
I begged you to please…

638
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,504
I begged you to stop gambling!

639
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,716
You're so damn loud.
I can't get any sleep!

640
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,218
Damn it.

641
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,597
Hey.

642
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,724
This is all your fault.

643
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,184
What?

644
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,812
You're the one who killed someone
and cut off a perfect way to make money.

645
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,691
That's how everything you do
ends up though, isn't it?

646
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,694
Is that just
how you were born or something?

647
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:13,904
Damn it.

648
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:15,864
Jeez.

649
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,243
Did you…

650
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:22,537
know about that?

651
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,457
Are you crazy?

652
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,799
If you knew about it this entire time,

653
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,094
how come you acted like
you didn't know anything?

654
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,888
Hey.

655
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,431
How many times have I told you?

656
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,267
You're responsible
for cleaning up your own mess.

657
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,644
Then what about me?

658
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,188
What about me?

659
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,942
Why do I have to be responsible
for your gambling debts?

660
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,485
Why do I deserve that?

661
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,278
You can't even do that for me?

662
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,447
I'm living with a nurse
who killed someone.

663
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,742
You're the one who killed that patient.

664
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,037
You're the one who killed him!

665
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,833
Why are you acting
like it wasn't you all this time?

666
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,335
You're talking nonsense.

667
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,131
Just go get some money, okay?

668
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:19,553
Because if you don't,
both of our lives are over.

669
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:34,693
I only gave him the anti-anesthetic.

670
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:41,366
I double-checked and even triple-checked
before administering it.

671
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,285
Ms. Byeon.

672
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,371
You administered Vecaron, Ms. Byeon.

673
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,708
You mixed the two of them up.
Why are you acting like that?

674
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,459
No, I didn't!

675
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,421
I only gave him the anti-anesthetic!

676
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:59,718
Aren't you the one who gave him Vecaron
and framing me for it?

677
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,928
You're trying to implicate
a completely innocent bystander!

678
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,763
Do I look like an easy target to you?

679
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,016
Am I some kind of joke to you?

680
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,475
Are you serious right now?

681
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,437
I didn't!

682
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:14,524
I only gave him the anti-anesthetic!

683
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,527
Somebody say something!

684
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:21,406
You all know that I really only gave him
the anti-anesthetic.

685
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:25,410
I really only gave him
the anti-anesthetic. It wasn't me.

686
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,370
It really wasn't me.

687
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,933
Ji-yeon…

688
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,228
What do you want?

689
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,948
Okay, fine.

690
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,034
I'll…

691
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,953
I'll take…

692
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,872
the blame for you.

693
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,876
Instead of ruining the life
of a high and mighty doctor,

694
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:18,213
the hospital would rather have

695
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,591
a lowly nurse to cover for them
since it's much less of a risk.

696
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,427
But…

697
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,973
I have one condition.

698
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,311
Gosh.

699
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,524
I knew it.

700
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,117
How much do you want?

701
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,876
Marriage.

702
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,961
What?

703
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,343
This is crazy.

704
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,263
Hey.

705
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,850
Do you even want to get married to me?

706
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,101
Yes.

707
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,102
Why?

708
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,479
I want to take this chance…

709
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,025
to take you down with me.

710
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,193
And if you don't marry me,

711
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,822
I'm going to do everything
I can to make your life a living hell.

712
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,934
Hey…

713
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:22,522
How did you and the neighbor lady
make up all of a sudden?

714
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,986
The kids get along with each other.

715
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,863
Dong-seok?

716
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,039
We ran into them at the clinic.

717
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:41,875
The clinic?

718
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,710
What clinic?

719
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:50,592
Apparently, Yu-bin has
a habit of lying all the time.

720
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,053
Oh, I see.

721
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,724
So that's why…

722
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,899
I guess every family has their own
trouble when raising a kid.

723
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,151
It sure isn't easy.

724
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:13,990
I'm off to bed.

725
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,071
Chun-hui, did you get some rest?

726
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,823
Thank you so much for today.

727
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:06,793
CHUN-HUI, DID YOU GET SOME REST?
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TODAY.

728
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,173
In life,

729
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,428
knowing the truth
can be like poison sometimes.

730
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:29,399
It can be better to live your life
without knowing the whole story.

731
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,300
Jeez.

732
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,105
What are you doing in here?

733
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:11,816
What are you doing?

734
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,738
You know I don't like you coming into
my office without my permission.

735
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,409
What is it?

736
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,373
I see.

737
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:31,753
You're wondering what
the actors said, aren't you?

738
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,631
They're all a bunch of idiots!

739
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,842
Of course, they're dying
to play a role in my movie.

740
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:40,511
They literally begged me like dogs

741
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,556
because they wanted me to cast them.

742
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,352
You should've been there
to see it, Yeong-mi.

743
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,358
That wasn't what you wanted to ask me?

744
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,444
Darn it.

745
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,906
What is it then?

746
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,076
I see.

747
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:04,911
Is it because of the kids?

748
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,708
Is that really even a big issue though?

749
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,794
Just as you said,

750
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:16,923
sometimes a dad can get scary
when he's disciplining his kids.

751
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,717
Isn't that the proper way
to raise children?

752
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,719
Why did you lock them in the bathroom?

753
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:24,847
Why did you throw the cup
and act like you didn't know about it?

754
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:28,351
How could you do those things
when you know how hard I work

755
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:30,561
to lay a healthy
groundwork for my children?

756
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:35,149
A healthy groundwork for your children?

757
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:39,070
Jeez, I'm really sick of your attitude
of trying to be like a virtuous person.

758
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:41,239
I've been with you for years
and I'm still not used to it!

759
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:42,490
Yeong-mi!

760
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,078
Can't you just speak normally?

761
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:57,422
Who said you could look at my computer?

762
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,257
Is that really important right now?

763
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,093
What in the world is this?

764
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,974
I told you before.

765
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:13,187
That woman was my muse
and the subject of my articles.

766
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:18,901
And you're my companion,
compatriot, and support system.

767
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,821
A muse is just a muse.

768
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:26,200
Something like a spirit
that exists to inspire my work.

769
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:30,788
And now, you get to be
the wife of a genius director.

770
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,916
Isn't it exhilarating
just thinking about it?

771
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,586
What kind of ridiculous nonsense is that?

772
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,838
What are you saying?

773
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:42,300
Did you…

774
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,260
sleep with her?

775
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,432
I did.

776
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,518
I slept with her.

777
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,693
Did this woman…

778
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,696
die because of you?

779
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,073
How would I know?

780
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,410
But actually, a woman
like her deserves to die.

781
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:12,371
You're also forgetting that
all of this is already in the past.

782
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,082
That woman is dead and gone, okay?

783
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,627
And Yeong-mi, can you give up on me?

784
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,671
You're going to be an intellectual woman
who supported the greatest director.

785
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,716
Do you want to give that up
and become a divorcée again?

786
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:25,468
No.

787
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,805
You could never do that. You know why?

788
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,893
Because the one thing that's most
important to you is your reputation.

789
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:08,511
Let's look into the period
of Belle Époque in the next class.

790
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,638
That will be all for today's lecture.

791
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,181
Good work everyone.

792
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,684
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

793
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,485
-Good work.
-You too.

794
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,705
Do you have any loose change?

795
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,498
No, I don't think so.

796
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,042
That means I can only get one then.

797
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,712
-Oh right, did you hear the rumor?
-About what?

798
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:45,590
-About Seo Jin-ha, the artist.
-Of course, I heard.

799
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,216
She committed suicide
because she had an affair, right?

800
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,095
Yes. Then did you also see the naked photo
of her that the guy spread around?

801
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:54,265
I haven't seen it myself
but Seong Min-jun says he saw it.

802
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,475
Maybe the assistant
only let the boys see it.

803
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,354
Gosh, that's crazy though.
How could he do something like that?

804
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,731
Tell me about it.

805
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,524
So nobody knows who he is?

806
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,067
No one knows.

807
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,739
Or maybe they do know
and they're just not telling anyone.

808
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,407
Excuse me…

809
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:16,495
What are you talking about?

810
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:05,544
GWANGHWAMUN

811
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:32,631
Jin-ha's photos are all over the Internet.

812
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,051
You're aware that
this is a serious crime, right?

813
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,344
It's a serious criminal offense that
falls under defamation of the deceased.

814
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,055
Just tell me
where you got that photo from.

815
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:41,057
Is he her boyfriend or something?

816
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,100
I heard she had an affair.

817
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,019
Please handle this as soon as possible.

818
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:47,605
I don't want my wife's personal life
to be disclosed any further.

819
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,106
Do you know Lee Eun-pyo?

820
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,817
What's going on?
You said you'd take care of it.

821
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,111
What are you trying to do to the deceased?

822
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:57,656
Honestly, I don't think you should
get yourself involved in this issue.

823
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:00,868
Stop. You're the one
who's trying to complicate things.

824
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:02,787
Don't you think he would want

825
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,289
to keep only beautiful memories of her?

826
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:14,965
