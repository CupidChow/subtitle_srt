00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,573
Do you want to pick out a toy
you'd like to play with?

3
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:02,122
There are a lot of fun toys.
How about you go and pick something out?

4
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,003
Isn't there anything
that you want to play with?

5
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,800
-Dad, open this for me.
-All right.

6
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,413
PRESSURED, HATE, BORED

7
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,624
LONELY, SAD

8
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,084
Can you take a look

9
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,046
and pick out one of these cards
that best describes

10
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,007
how you're feeling, Dong-seok?

11
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,141
He's a very bright child.

12
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,020
He's in the top one percent
among his peers.

13
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,609
Gifted children tend to be as sensitive
as the level of their intelligence.

14
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,404
So you must have had a much
harder time raising him than most parents.

15
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,284
Usually, many parents of gifted children
overlook their children.

16
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,411
Being intellectually gifted doesn't mean

17
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,414
that their emotional development
is also at an adult level.

18
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,918
It's no easy task to cope
with that kind of imbalance.

19
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,463
So what about Dong-seok?

20
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,800
We can't be sure
what external factor caused this

21
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,137
but it seems that he's suffering from
a conversion disorder due to PTSD.

22
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,515
In his case, it seems to be manifesting
itself as selective mutism.

23
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,396
But ma'am.

24
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,650
Why is this happening all of a sudden?

25
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,989
We're not the type of parents
who abuse our children.

26
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,077
I raise them with so much love.

27
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,122
It may be because he's a gifted child.

28
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,960
Being born with such a gift is not
the same as hitting the lottery.

29
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,882
Gifted children have to endure
the frustration that an adult

30
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,052
might experience when they are forced
to only interact with children.

31
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,639
If they express their frustration,
then they're labeled as being a show-off.

32
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,892
It's hard for them to find
friends that they can relate to.

33
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,729
But how many people do you think
can live without any friends?

34
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,149
Without the proper emotional support
in times like that,

35
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,944
they are emotionally damaged
more than others.

36
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,490
Jae-ung.

37
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,785
Do you think…

38
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,163
I've done something wrong?

39
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,504
What did I do wrong?

40
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,221
Move, Dong-seok.

41
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,849
Mom, hold me instead of Dong-seok.

42
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,310
How come you're not holding me?

43
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,646
Dong-ju, it's dangerous.
Sit properly in your booster seat.

44
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,067
No! Tell Dong-seok to move!

45
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,361
I want you to hold me!

46
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,781
Dong-seok's older than me, and I'm a baby!

47
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,451
So Dong-seok should be sitting by himself!

48
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,202
Your brother is also a baby!

49
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,831
Your brother…

50
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,417
is also a baby.

51
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,670
Your brother

52
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,467
is still a baby to me.

53
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,052
He's a baby.

54
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,057
Your brother is still a baby to me.

55
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,114

57
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,410
Father…

58
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,955
Father!

59
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,833

Father!

62
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,800
Father…

63
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,719
Father, what do I do?

64
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,264
What do I do?

65
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,019
Father…

66
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,280
Dong-seok!

67
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,782
Dong-seok!

68
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,076
Dong-seok!

69
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,997
-Dong-seok!
-Dong-seok!

70
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,542
Dong-seok!

71
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,211
Dong-seok!

72
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,004
-Dong-seok!
-Eun-pyo, no!

73
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,381
-Dong-seok!
-No!

74
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,508
Dong-seok!

75
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,009
Dong-seok!

76
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,762
-No!
-Dong-seok!

77
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,389
Dong-seok!

78
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,850
-Dong-seok!
-It's dangerous!

79
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,352
-No!
-Dong-seok!

80
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,818
Dong-seok!

81
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,027
-Dong-seok!
-Dong-seok!

82
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,655
-Dong-seok!
-Dong-seok!

83
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,618
Dong-seok!

84
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,668
Dong-seok!

85
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,794
Eun-pyo.

86
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,297
Hey, Eun-pyo.

87
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,299
Dong-seok…

88
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,678
Lee Eun-pyo. Snap out of it.

89
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,596
Dong-seok.

90
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,849
Eun-pyo, wake up.

91
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,267
Dong-seok!

92
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,982
Were you having a nightmare?

93
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,071
Dong-seok…

94
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,143
What kind of dream was it?

95
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,563
Eun-pyo.

96
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,487
Dong-seok…

97
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,742
was inside a burning paint shop.

98
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,371
And I had…

99
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,998
no idea.

100
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,968
It's all my fault.

101
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,888
I didn't know what was going on with him
and I was just happy about everything.

102
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,140
-It's not your fault.
-Then whose fault is it?

103
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,685
Even you told me
I was pushing him so hard.

104
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,357
Sorry.

105
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,610
But…

106
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:34,532
no matter how much I think about it,
I can't come up with an explanation.

107
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,328
Could it really be because of
how much I was pushing him?

108
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,663
Is that really it?

109
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,710
Do you think

110
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,796
maybe something happened
to him at the academy?

111
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,674
The kids could've ostracized him.

112
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,176
There's no other explanation

113
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,929
for why he would suddenly
be like this, don't you think so?

114
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,852
I'm positive that there's something
we're just not thinking of.

115
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,482
I'm sure he'll start talking
if we find the reason.

116
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,069
Yes, I'm sure he will.

117
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,282
He'll be right as rain in no time, right?

118
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,715
After his appearance on Genius Kids Show,
he received a lot of attention

119
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,216
and I'm sure that came
with a lot of jealousy.

120
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,928
But those types of emotional battles
are commonplace at academies like here.

121
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,264
I understand that it may be upsetting,

122
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,850
but I'm sure we're not
responsible for this.

123
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,648
He's at a much more
advanced level than his peers

124
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,234
and that sometimes caused difficulties
in getting along with his friends,

125
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,403
but more than that…

126
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,992
Couldn't it be because of his academies?
Maybe they pressured him too much.

127
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,454
I mean, he was always doing
homework even during recess,

128
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,164
so when I asked him why,

129
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,669
he said he'd be in a lot of trouble
with his academy teachers if he didn't.

130
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,640
You're flattering us.

131
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,476
It's not because of us.
It's that Jun-u performed very well.

132
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,269
All we did was point him
in the proper direction.

133
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,187
Yes?

134
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,272
Of course. Come in.

135
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,566
Yes.

136
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,779
He's burned out.

137
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,949
But it happened so fast.

138
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:44,120
Usually, if it happens fast,
it happens around 5th or 6th grade.

139
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,580
What do you mean by burned out?

140
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,374
As kids start to pick up
the pace of their studies,

141
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,210
some of them start
to lose touch with reality.

142
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:55,256
That means they're susceptible to stress,
so you'll have to find another plan.

143
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,759
If you run the risk
of the kids burning out,

144
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,387
why would you push them so hard?

145
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,849
We can't tell them not to do anything
just because they could be burned out.

146
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,727
But Dong-seok was following your guidance

147
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,646
and that's how he stopped talking.

148
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,982
As someone who was responsible
for his education,

149
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,818
don't you feel any guilt at all?

150
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:22,116
I'm sorry, but I think you're getting
something wrong here, ma'am.

151
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,118
Why are you trying to force
that responsibility onto us?

152
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,454
We're responsible for their results,

153
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,539
not for them to build their characters.

154
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,625
And are you saying
that you weren't pushing him?

155
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,962
How about you ask yourself
who is responsible for this whole--

156
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,424
Then are you saying all of this is
the mother's fault for wanting too much?

157
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,927
You said you were an expert!

158
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,598
What you're doing is taking advantage
of parents who are ignorant of education!

159
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,184
All right.

160
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,145
I understand that you're trying
to skirt the responsibility.

161
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,608
Either way, I think you should find
your own way to educate him.

162
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,651
I'd like you to leave now.

163
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,865
I regret being ignorant enough
to have trusted you as an educator.

164
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,951
I hope you start being honest

165
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,954
and start calling yourself a salesman
instead of an education expert.

166
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,674
My mom and dad
both graduated from Harvard.

167
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,092
-Come on!
-Nonsense!

168
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,845
-Come on!
-Don't you know that my dad's a doctor?

169
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,639
My mom's a doctor too,

170
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,350
but she only stopped working
because she had to raise us.

171
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,353
I didn't want to say anything about this,

172
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,774
but my grandpa's actually
the director of Eulju Hospital.

173
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,986
They told me all I had to do was
become a doctor and inherit the hospital.

174
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,655
I don't believe any of that.

175
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,698
All she does is lie.

176
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,908
What?

177
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,078
You guys will only end up
going to community college.

178
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,331
I'm on a different level than you guys.

179
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,085
The driver overheard their conversation

180
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,170
and felt that he needed
to make a recording.

181
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,675
She was obviously coming up with lies

182
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,971
and he was concerned that the other kids
might eventually start to exclude her.

183
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,184
Kim Yu-bin.

184
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,980
When did I ever tell you
that I was a doctor?

185
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,315
Why do you keep lying?

186
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:22,111
No one is going to be friends
with you if you keep lying like that.

187
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,239
You said you graduated from a good school.

188
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,742
That means you graduated from Harvard.

189
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,290
Then what about grandpa?

190
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,834
Why did you say
he was the director of a hospital?

191
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,587
Grandpa has been
bedridden this entire time!

192
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,630
You saw him yourself the other day!

193
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,841
I don't know.

194
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,052
I don't know why I keep lying.

195
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,641
I want to stop lying,

196
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,228
but they just keep on coming out.

197
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,190
I can't help myself.

198
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,320
Okay, so what is it?

199
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,489
So are you saying she's insane or what?

200
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,076
Watch your words, she could be listening.

201
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,496
Is she a pathological liar or something?

202
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,293
Well, good job.

203
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,254
You pushed them so hard

204
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,214
and now one of them is a liar.

205
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,009
Look what happened
after looking down on me like that.

206
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,344
Is this the result
that you've come up with?

207
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,679
Is putting all the blame on me
going to solve anything?

208
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,932
That's why I'm trying to
talk about it together.

209
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,768
Why are you asking me to help you
clean up the mess you made?

210
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,977
You're pissing me off.

211
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,979
Damn it.

212
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,531
This is so annoying.

213
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:01,126
PATHOLOGICAL LYING IS THE CHRONIC
BEHAVIOR OF COMPULSIVE OR HABITUAL LYING

214
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,006
Damn it.

215
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,894
Welcome, sir.
You came without getting any sleep?

216
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,604
-Is there still a game going on?
-Of course, sir.

217
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,658
-That's five million won.
-Thanks.

218
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,576
-I hope you win big, sir.
-Thank you.

219
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,008
Mom.

220
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,176
What is it?

221
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,263
Am I going insane?

222
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,600
Come over here, Yu-bin.

223
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,277
It's not like that.

224
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:14,450
Your dad just got angry and said
some things that he didn't mean.

225
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,412
But…

226
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,668
Let's find out why you keep lying.

227
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,796
There's bound to be a solution, okay?

228
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,839
Okay.

229
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,509
It's fine.

230
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,098
My girl. Come here.

231
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,144
Gosh, my baby.

232
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,391
Can anyone recommend
a good pediatric psychiatrist?

233
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,563
I think my child has tic disorders.

234
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,776
NEWS FEED

235
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:47,126
WEChild Clinic is the most famous
one in the neighborhood.

236
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,548
Thank you.

237
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,135
It's not easy looking up things like this

238
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,470
and I'm struggling.

239
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,808
I feel like it's all my fault
that my child is having a hard time.

240
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,855
I totally understand you.

241
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,691
When a child runs into trouble,

242
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,528
all of the fingers seem to
point back toward the mother.

243
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,696
Either way,

244
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:20,909
it's a mom's job to take care
of their children until the very end.

245
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,580
Don't give up.

246
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,088
Dong-seok, what are you doing here?

247
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,266
Jung Dong-seok. Open the door.

248
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,519
Didn't I tell you not to lock the door?

249
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,562
Open the door this instant!

250
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,064
Jung Dong-seok!

251
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,607
What's going on?

252
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,952
Jung Dong-seok!

253
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,206
Where is he?

254
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,541
Dong-seok!

255
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,755
What do you think you're doing right now?

256
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,840
Eun-pyo.

257
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,260
Dong-seok.

258
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,929
Let's get out of the closet first.

259
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,056
Daddy's going to hold you.

260
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,315
All right.

261
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,162
TOP MATH

262
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,844
When did you finish this workbook?

263
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,057
Have you been staying up
at night to finish this?

264
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,018
I said you didn't have to study
this kind of stuff anymore!

265
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,227
Stop it!

266
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,605
Why are you shouting at him?
He's scared enough.

267
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,275
Everyone stop it!

268
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,071
It's so loud I can't sleep at all!

269
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:49,284
I want to sleep!

270
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,139
This side.

271
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,812
Yu-bin, do you know
where we're going today?

272
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,772
Yes.

273
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:23,819
Be honest when answering
the psychiatrist's questions.

274
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,654
Okay?

275
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,989
Let's go.

276
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,244
Mom, I have to pee.

277
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,456
Take your shoes off.

278
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,093
-Hello.
-Hello.

279
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,344
You're just a bit early.

280
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,388
Mom, I want to eat a snack.

281
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,848
Snacks!

282
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,932
Okay.

283
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,017
Mom, let's eat some snacks.

284
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,563
-I want some tasty snacks.
-All right, jeez.

285
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,149
This one or this one?

286
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,193
-Pick one out for yourself too, Dong-seok.
-This one or this one?

287
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,113
-Walnuts.
-You can only pick out one each.

288
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,118
We have an appointment for Kim Yu-bin.

289
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,078
-At 2 p.m., right?
-Yes.

290
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,371
-You can head right in.
-Thank you.

291
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,249
Only pick one.
We have to eat dinner later.

292
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,085
I don't think
this is different from that one.

293
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,921
Do you want something too, Dong-seok?
How about orange juice?

294
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,178
Pick one. Are you done picking?

295
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,849
It seems like he was privately solving
problems from his workbook every night.

296
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,268
That difficult workbook
was solved in its entirety.

297
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,354
He barely slept because of it

298
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,900
and yet he still begs me
to take him back to the academy.

299
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,528
The academy pushed him so hard, but
he wants to go to the academy so badly.

300
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,282
I have no idea why he's acting like this.

301
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:57,537
It seems like he's been brainwashed
by the academy that he has to study hard.

302
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,831
Trying to stop him does nothing.

303
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,791
What should I do?

304
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,879
It's only expected that he would be
nervous after stepping down the path

305
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,589
he's traveled down for so long.

306
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,010
But I don't think that's the only reason.

307
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,598
What do you mean?

308
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,439
MOM'S WISH

309
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:28,026
I asked Dong-seok if he enjoyed studying.

310
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,155
He didn't express his feelings
and instead, he wrote this.

311
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,867
It seems like

312
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,413
Dong-seok felt your desperation
on a very deep level

313
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,000
and it's been weighing on him
almost too heavily.

314
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,506
How about we try it just for one day?

315
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,259
And if you don't like it, we can stop.

316
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:59,766
It's Mommy's wish.
Do you really not want to?

317
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,269
Dong-seok.

318
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,758
MOM'S WISH

319
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,148
Yu-bin has a very strong drive
to seek approval.

320
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,568
The problem is that she only sought
that approval through her good grades.

321
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,195
As people started to stop
showing interest in her,

322
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,655
her anxiety started to grow.

323
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,701
I believe she started to lie
to deal with her anxiety.

324
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:09,085
Mom, am I really sick?

325
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,262
No, they said you're not that sick.

326
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,725
And they also told me
that you're not alone.

327
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,354
To be honest…

328
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,023
I also do that a lot of the time.

329
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,817
Really?

330
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,155
Adults have a lot of things that
they want to hide from each other too.

331
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,076
And the easiest way to deal with it is…

332
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,039
just that.

333
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,334
Oh, okay.

334
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,421
But Yu-bin.

335
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,676
Lies…

336
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,264
might seem easy at first,

337
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:09,062
but they end up snowballing
and ruining everything in the end.

338
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,107
So it's better not to start them at all.

339
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,150
Okay?

340
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,197
Let's go.

341
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,870
First floor. Going down.

342
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,103
Dong-seok.

343
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,647
Come over here.

344
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,824
Dong-seok.

345
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,536
Here's the thing.

346
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,541
Mommy's sorry.

347
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,672
I wasn't thinking about your feelings

348
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,216
and all I did was get angry at you.

349
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,302
To be honest,

350
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,221
I was just as upset as you were.

351
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,644
I have one wish

352
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:36,608
that I never ever told you before.

353
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,985
And that wish is…

354
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,906
I want you to

355
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,700
smile happily.

356
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,912
I want to see that.

357
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,251
I forgot about that wish
of mine for a moment.

358
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,632
That's the only thing I want from you now.

359
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,550
Okay?

360
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,720
My goodness.

361
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,182
I want a hug too, Mommy!

362
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,100
Get in here, Dong-ju.

363
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,978
My goodness.

364
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,314
My little puppies.

365
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,776
I love you, Mom. I love you, Dong-seok.

366
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,654
I love you, too.

367
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,120
It's Dong-seok.

368
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,333
Dong-seok, what are you doing here?

369
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,545
Why are you being hugged
by your mom like a baby?

370
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,133
Dong-seok said he doesn't
really feel like playing today.

371
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,594
Would it be okay
if he took some alone time today?

372
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,971
-Okay.
-Let's go.

373
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,984
What can we do to get you back
in a good mood, Dong-seok?

374
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,163
What'd you just write?

375
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,749
Can you write it out one more time?

376
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,632
Hen…

377
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,179
Henry?

378
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,439
Dong-seok, do you miss Henry?

379
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,951
-Two, two, three, four.
-Two, two, three, four.

380
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,204
-Five, six, seven, eight.
-Five, six, seven, eight.

381
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,831
All right, now let's switch feet.

382
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,834
-Are we all switched up? All right!
-Yes.

383
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,423
Isn't there anything
you want to do, Dong-seok?

384
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,426
Dong-ju said he wanted to build a snowman.

385
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,263
How do you feel about going sledding then?

386
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,566
Aren't you coming today?

387
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,114
He doesn't like going to places
where there are a lot of people.

388
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,658
I don't think we'll be going for a while.

389
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:35,620
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

390
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,915
That's a problem.
It must be rough for you.

391
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,418
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to help. Whenever.

392
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,588
Thanks for thinking of me.

393
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,423
-Sit down and stand up.
-Jeez.

394
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,009
-One, two, three, four,
-Goodness.

395
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,512
five, six, seven, eight.

396
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,807
One of the moms from
the gifted student's academy told me

397
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,600
that he ran out
in the middle of his presentation.

398
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,519
He didn't even get to
finish his presentation.

399
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,562
She said that it looked like
he even wet his pants.

400
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,232
I heard it looked like
he was having some sort of seizure.

401
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,942
-A seizure?
-Really?

402
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,778
I wonder what got into him?
He was such a smart boy.

403
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,530
They were cutting it really close.

404
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,949
Gosh, maybe I should've said something.

405
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,702
Was there something going on
in that household?

406
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,412
No, it's not that.

407
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:21,708
His mom's ambition started bubbling up
and started pushing him so hard.

408
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,877
Honestly, it's not like
he decided to participate in

409
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,047
all those competitions and
win every award all on his own.

410
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,091
-You're right.
-I agree.

411
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,845
What's the point of being smart
if you start feeling sick emotionally?

412
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,388
-That's right.
-Right.

413
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,557
-We're blessed.
-Exactly.

414
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,143
-What do you think you're doing?
-That scared me.

415
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,144
Is this amusing?

416
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,979
Is this amusing to you?

417
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:46,983
Come on, who here
is saying this is amusing?

418
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,570
You have this habit of freaking out
all of a sudden. You need to fix that.

419
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,572
I'm tired of hearing it.

420
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,907
You guys were loving
every moment of it just now.

421
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,287
Who appointed you
as the guardian of justice?

422
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,663
When did that happen?

423
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,041
I actually just started today.

424
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,960
Is she trying to repay Eun-pyo
for all that she's done for her?

425
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,506
I see.

426
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,425
So what you're telling me is

427
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:16,179
you were getting insanely
jealous of her, is that it?

428
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,016
But in front of Eun-pyo,
you acted all coy and friendly, right?

429
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,519
As soon as she's out of the picture,
your attitude changes just like that.

430
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,105
Coy and friendly?
You think I was sucking up to her?

431
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,106
Listen.

432
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,818
You always stick to one after another
to get all the information, right?

433
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,155
Is there anyone here who doesn't know
about that weird behavior of hers?

434
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,449
And excuse me!

435
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,076
I'm talking to you!

436
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,661
You always hide behind Jae-bin's mom

437
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,081
and gossip about other people
behind their backs.

438
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,583
You need to cut it out
and stop living like that!

439
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,001
What did you just say?

440
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,420
How does every single
one of you choose to do

441
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,923
only the saddest, most pathetic,
and lame things ever?

442
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,633
You're all so pathetic.

443
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,137
Hey!

444
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,598
What?

445
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,601
You couldn't even do
anything to me if you wanted to.

446
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,357
-Darn you.
-My goodness.

447
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,485
Let go.

448
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,153
I can't let go.

449
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,991
You picked the wrong day.

450
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,368
-Hey!
-Goodness.

451
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,161
Do you know who I am?

452
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,038
-Hey!
-Somebody help me!

453
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,125
I used to roll with Chun-hyang's crew
in Bujeong-dong, you brat.

454
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,293
I never lived there, so how would I know?

455
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,087
Goodness me.

456
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,340
-Oh no, just stop.
-My goodness.

457
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,633
-Get back here.
-My gosh!

458
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,844
-Hey!
-Stop it! What are you doing?

459
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,012
-Back up!
-Somebody grab her!

460
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,848
-Stop it!
-Call the police!

461
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,891
Hey, grab her!

462
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,232
Can I have some bandaids
and some iodine please?

463
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,491
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

464
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,873
Gosh, that hurts.

465
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,626
Jeez.

466
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,005
-Mom.
-Yes?

467
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,965
Why are you laughing?

468
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,801
Well…

469
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,886
Just because?

470
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,806
I just can't seem to stop laughing.

471
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,728
You know?

472
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,397
People shouldn't try to
suppress their true nature.

473
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,943
Gosh, I should've always
lived my life like this.

474
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,989
-Su-in.
-Yes?

475
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,867
-Should we eat something good today?
-Like what?

476
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,994
What should we have?

477
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,287
Tteokbokki?

478
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,872
I was so pissed off

479
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,666
that I grabbed her hair
and nearly ripped all of it off.

480
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,922
Just let them be, okay?

481
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,424
People are always like that.

482
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,094
Sure.

483
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,599
Either way, thanks for standing up for me.

484
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,603
Eun-pyo.

485
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,606
I still have all that toughness
from my high school days.

486
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,318
I bet she can't move a muscle right now.

487
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,949
By the way, Yun-ju.

488
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:28,287
Were Dong-seok and Henry close?

489
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,747
What?

490
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,415
Dong-seok mentioned

491
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,461
that he misses Henry.

492
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:39,090
Gosh, Dong-seok said that to you?

493
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,801
No.

494
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,178
He wrote it on my hand.

495
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,228
Dong-seok and Henry used to
sit together in class, Eun-pyo.

496
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,314
I remember Su-in telling me
how noisy they were.

497
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,985
That's right. He was a gifted student too.

498
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:02,446
So don't you think
they must've had a lot in common?

499
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,200
I see.

500
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,410
So…

501
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,622
Even if Yu-bin comes up
with strange stories,

502
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,750
please don't think too much of it.

503
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,002
Goodness.

504
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,879
It must've been very hard for you as well.

505
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,509
On one hand, it's quite a relief

506
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,012
that you managed to
catch it earlier on in her life.

507
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:29,682
If you help her out whenever you can,

508
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:34,895
then perhaps this may turn out
to be a blessing in disguise.

509
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,649
Thank you.

510
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,612
Hey, Eun-seo. What is it?

511
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,491
Ms. Hwang, I left my math book.

512
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,577
-Is that right? Just a moment, please.
-Okay.

513
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,828
Come here.

514
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,123
-Did you remember it on your way home?
-Yes.

515
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,090
I heard that Dong-seok
from your class has selective mutism.

516
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,760
Here.

517
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,195
Hello.

518
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,010
Why aren't you responding to me?

519
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,347
Tell me whether you can or not
so I can let my guy know.

520
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,810
Do you even know
how dangerous those drugs are?

521
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,061
Gosh.

522
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,229
So what?

523
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,191
-Is that a no?
-Yes! It's a no!

524
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,154
Tell your guy that there's nothing
more coming out from my side.

525
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,202
Don't you need money?

526
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,664
Are you going to keep your kids like that?
Don't you need to pay for their tuition?

527
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,625
I don't need your drug money anymore!

528
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,062
HOW DID IT GO?

529
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:53,654
There was a setback with the General
Manager in Taiwan due to some issues.

530
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,492
But they will be sending out
a replacement soon.

531
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,245
I'll be there soon. Just hold on.

532
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,014
How've you been doing?

533
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,647
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

534
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:36,488
Could we meet up in person for a second?

535
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,295
I know it's shameless of me
to be asking this of you

536
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,633
considering you're having a hard time.

537
00:43:56,925 --> 00:44:00,554
But the only person
that Dong-seok will respond to

538
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,475
is Henry.

539
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,646
I'm sorry.

540
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,274
I guess I'm not ashamed
to ask for anything

541
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,902
now that I've become a mother.

542
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,656
No.

543
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,157
I understand.

544
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,789
It must've been really hard.

545
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,674
Jae-suk told me

546
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,051
that you're going to France.

547
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:40,803
Yes.

548
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,097
That's good.

549
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:47,893
It'll be much better for Henry
to be there than here.

550
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,813
Henry doesn't seem too fond of the idea.

551
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,315
He told me he didn't want to go.

552
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,609
I've been trying to convince him.

553
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,746
Also…

554
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,375
About last time…

555
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:19,425
I'm sorry. It wasn't something
I should've gotten angry at you for.

556
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,594
No.

557
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,930
I was wrong.

558
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:29,726
I was only thinking of myself
and not about how hard you were having it.

559
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,105
If I'm being honest…

560
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,109
I just really wanted to
run away from all the guilt.

561
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,406
I've been feeling inferior

562
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,700
to Jin-ha for a long time.

563
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:50,414
You know better than anyone
how incredible she really was.

564
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,541
But…

565
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,794
what I still can't wrap my head around

566
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,255
is why such a beautiful, graceful,

567
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,134
and downright gifted girl

568
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,553
would do something like that?

569
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,222
Why…

570
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,187
I'll be leaving then.

571
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,105
Call me.

572
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,382
Hello?

573
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,551
It's me.

574
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,346
Is Henry feeling better?

575
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,102
He's feeling better.

576
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,355
Then can you ask Henry--

577
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,774
How many times do I have to tell you
that he doesn't want to?

578
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,817
Why do you keep forcing him?

579
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,406
Hey, is that punk Oh Geon-u
hitting our kids?

580
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,617
What are you talking about?

581
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,661
Why do they get
more timid every single day?

582
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,955
Do you not notice it?

583
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,463
Do you have any proof
of what you're saying right now?

584
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,923
What did the kids say to you?

585
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,676
They cried saying
that their stepdad is scary!

586
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:36,103
It's normal for kids to be scared from
time to time when you're raising them.

587
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,730
Are you trying to
nitpick with me right now?

588
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,567
You still have that habit
of whitewashing everything.

589
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,402
I'm warning you.

590
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:47,364
If anything happens to them,
I'm not going to let it slide.

591
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,283
You better get your act together.

592
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,669
Who is it that you had to
pick up on the veranda?

593
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:03,255
Oh, it's just Sangkemo.

594
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,804
Yeong-mi, are you seeing
the kids' father by any chance?

595
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,601
Listen, Yeong-mi.

596
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:19,396
I want our family to be perfect.

597
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,565
But…

598
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,235
why does my loneliness keep growing?

599
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,947
You know how much I hate that punk.

600
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,908
So why do you keep doing that?

601
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,329
-We're back.
-We're back.

602
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,705
Hey, you're home.

603
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,833
Why don't you two
follow me to the supermarket?

604
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,086
I'm trying to make preserves
but we're out of sugar.

605
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,840
Hang on. Put down your bags.

606
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,928
Let's go. We'll be back.

607
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,140
We'll be back soon.

608
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,148
SUGAR

609
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:16,787
Is everything…

610
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:21,208
okay with my Sae-bom and Jul-pin?

611
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,545
I want to become the kind of mom

612
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,674
that both my son and daughter
can come and talk about anything

613
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,926
that's on their minds.

614
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:36,056
The reason why I participate in social
and environmental activities

615
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:40,018
is because I want you two
to live in a better world.

616
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,812
You know that, right?

617
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,276
Let me know if there's anything
you want to talk about.

618
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,614
Well…

619
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,367
Mom.

620
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,035
Yes?

621
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,122
Our stepdad…

622
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,208
really loves you, right?

623
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,962
Of course.

624
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:07,921
Why?

625
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:09,214
But…

626
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:13,093
I don't think he likes us very much.

627
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,470
Why?

628
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,310
He gets mad at us every day.

629
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,355
Whenever you're not home,
he always swears at us

630
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,066
and he even locked me
in the bathroom last time.

631
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:31,278
He once picked up a rag
and threw it at Sae-bom.

632
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,365
And even further back then,
it was actually him who broke the cup.

633
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:37,743
Dong-ju!

634
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:41,329
I'm just asking you
to check if you have the cup or not.

635
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,873
I'll leave if you check.

636
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,252
He started yelling all of a sudden

637
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:50,297
and then he just chucked it
out of the veranda.

638
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,675
Hey, we weren't supposed to tell her that.

639
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,263
Is that true, Sae-bom?

640
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,851
Yes.

641
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,203
Your dad only did that…

642
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,041
because he's an artist.

643
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,878
Artists can sometimes be a bit sensitive.

644
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,339
When they have trouble
producing their work,

645
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,425
they have it harder than anyone else
and it can get rough.

646
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:37,219
So…

647
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,805
that's why he acted like that.

648
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,723
Since we're family,

649
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:45,185
shouldn't we try to be
more understanding of his shortcomings?

650
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,864
"A warm wind flew in from a faraway sea."

651
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,992
"I could no longer smell
the fishy stink of the dock

652
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,787
or the smell of the people."

653
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,833
"It was the first time
in a very long time that I flew so far."

654
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:08,834
The end!

655
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,001
That's it for tonight.

656
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,963
Just one more.

657
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,840
No, that's enough.

658
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:18,051
If you want to meet up with Henry
on the weekend at the kids cafe,

659
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:20,053
you have to be
on your best behavior, okay?

660
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:25,141
Dong-seok, are you happy
that you're going to meet Henry?

661
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,144
Yes, I'm happy too!

662
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:29,729
Gosh.

663
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,614
This is Jin-ha's mother.

664
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:44,536
I heard from Henry's father.
Call me when you have time.

665
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,081
What is it, Mom?

666
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,666
What?

667
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,459
It's nothing.

668
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,088
Let's go to bed now.

669
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:07,809
I HEARD FROM HENRY'S FATHER.
CALL ME WHEN YOU HAVE TIME.

670
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:18,236
HENRY'S GRANDMOTHER

671
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,705
Hello?

672
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,042
Hello, ma'am.

673
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,462
This is Lee Eun-pyo.

674
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,173
I've been waiting for your call.

675
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,927
I heard from Henry's father.

676
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:45,138
Instead of talking like this,
why don't you come over to my place?

677
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,350
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

678
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:35,855
Who is it?

679
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:41,111
Hello, it's Dong-seok's mother.

680
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,280
-Henry!
-Jung Dong-seok!

681
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:48,076
Did you know we have a huge dog here?

682
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,494
But he's really nice.

683
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:52,747
He knows "sit," "stand," "paw,"
and even knows how to play dead.

684
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,999
Really?

685
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,709
-Yes.
-Show us.

686
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,168
Okay, let's go.

687
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,599
Hey, wait for me!

688
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:36,708
But…

689
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,210
What was it you wanted to talk about?

690
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:42,380
Guys, follow me. I'll show you
a really cool painting. Come this way.

691
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,508
-Boys, don't touch the paintings.
-Wait for me!

692
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,305
Oh, that's what it was.

693
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,890
It's a tiger, right?

694
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:55,060
I'm going to try
and get the overall shape first.

695
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,102
What?

696
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:44,109
SEO JIN-HA

697
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,557
Me and other friends were
so envious of anyone

698
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,767
who got to wear

699
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,146
this uniform.

700
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,774
Jin-ha looked so pretty

701
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:28,153
when she had this uniform on.

702
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,908
To be honest,

703
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,328
I was very jealous of Jin-ha

704
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:42,584
for a very long time.

705
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,756
She was always better
than me at everything.

706
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:53,219
She seemed like she had it all
and that made me envious of her.

707
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,015
I felt guilty about those feelings.

708
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,434
That's why

709
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:03,188
I wasn't able to tell you properly.

710
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:08,276
What happened between me and
Henry's father was a misunderstanding.

711
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,571
I hope…

712
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,409
you'll believe me.

713
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,623
Did it really seem like

714
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,959
Jin-ha had it all?

715
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,880
You know that

716
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,634
I'm Jin-ha's stepmother, right?

717
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:39,516
My very existence must've
caused a lot of pain for her.

718
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,062
I guess she didn't mention that to you.

719
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,025
What did you draw, Henry?

720
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:55,073
Oh, this is the girl
that used to live here.

721
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,116
Then who are these people?

722
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,577
Look, this is her dad

723
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,454
and this is her mom.

724
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:05,208
And this one is her dad's student.

725
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,252
Did his student live with them?

726
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,379
Yes.

727
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:10,964
-Okay, I'm going to take the picture.
-Because the girl

728
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:14,551
-One, two, three.
-begged her to live with them.

729
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,887
Just trust me and try it out once.

730
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,641
Because there was no one

731
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,269
to take care of the girl in the house.

732
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,437
Not at all. You look like a princess.

733
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,439
So what happened?

734
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,733
Did everyone get along?

735
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,238
But why would that make Jin-ha

736
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:39,951
a child that nobody cared for?

737
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,088
Jin-ha's mother…

738
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,677
suffered from schizophrenia.

739
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,058
So ever since birth,

740
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:08,605
she was never fully
taken care of by her own mother.

741
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,528
And also,

742
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,115
she was always afraid

743
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,744
that she might take after her mother.

744
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:31,794
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE
GEOSEONG UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS

745
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,494
There are so many things

746
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,663
that I've done wrong to Jin-ha.

747
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,378
I think part of the reason why
I let out all of that resentment on you

748
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:16,214
was because I wanted
to be free of some of my own guilt.

749
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,466
I think that's what happened.

750
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,843
You're doing this to me on purpose.

751
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,930
You're trying to make me feel small.

752
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,599
What's wrong, Eun-pyo?

753
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,850
Right.

754
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:32,146
Ever since you were young,
you had a weird way of messing

755
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,650
with other people's emotions
with that innocent face of yours.

756
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,821
And you always took advantage of me.

757
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,864
You have everything.

758
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,992
Why are you all worked up
to take everything I want as well?

759
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,830
Do you have some sort of mental condition?

760
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,808
You know,

761
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,270
I was thrilled that my dear old friend

762
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:17,191
became a neighborhood friend.

763
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,780
I couldn't open up

764
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:27,827
about my feelings to people I met
after becoming an adult.

765
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:32,832
How is it…

766
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:34,876
for you?

767
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:53,519
You know how much I like you, right?

768
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,897
You and I…

769
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,609
are back on good terms now, okay?

770
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,403
Eun-pyo, come on!

771
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:07,760
MAY THE WAVES OF LIFE
LAST AS ECHOES OF THE HEART…

772
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:11,430
SEO JIN-HA

773
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,057
Congratulations, Jin-ha.

774
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,852
They're so pretty.

775
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:17,812
Thank you.

776
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:28,489
It's nice here.

777
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,326
You get lots of sunlight too.

778
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:37,582
I was wondering
why they put you up so high,

779
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,793
but I guess this is what it was all about.

780
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,264
I'm sorry…

781
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,268
for everything.

782
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:04,066
I never thought
you truly liked me as a friend.

783
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,487
I misunderstood you

784
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,199
and hated you.

785
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:16,245
That was really unfair of me, wasn't it?

786
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,417
I didn't know anything

787
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,672
and said all those things to you.

788
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,343
I'm so sorry.

789
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,274
I did so many bad things to you

790
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,653
without even realizing it.

791
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,507
If I knew they were going to
put this photo here,

792
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,177
I would have bought
the 60,000 won bouquet.

793
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,430
They were prettier.

794
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:29,318
But you're still the prettiest
out of everyone here.

795
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,781
I'll be back.

796
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:59,557
Not just in art history,

797
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,643
there were also
many other geniuses in humanity.

798
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,981
They expanded
the limits of human knowledge.

799
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:12,403
It's thanks to them that we can enjoy
such a rich culture today.

800
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:19,410
There's a common misconception

801
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:24,498
that geniuses simply
have to bring out the brilliance

802
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,209
from their god-given talent.

803
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,212
Those so-called "gifted ones."

804
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,631
But is that really the case?

805
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:38,095
We have a double standard
when it comes to how we treat geniuses.

806
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,639
We revere, yet we envy.

807
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,310
We covet, yet we observe.

808
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,814
We're like spectators in a circus.

809
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,276
We get to sit in the comfort of our seats
and judge them to see

810
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:53,861
how much they can advance.

811
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:57,740
But one thing that we can't overlook

812
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,743
is that geniuses endure deep loneliness

813
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,870
than most of us will ever experience.

814
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:06,999
WECHILD COUNSELING CENTER

815
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,543
He struggled a bit more than usual today.

816
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,922
He barely reacted to the writing exercise
and refused to interact.

817
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:16,467
Was there an incident that may have
caused him to withdraw like this?

818
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,803
I'm not sure.

819
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:25,518
Could it be that he's sad that his friend
is going to be leaving soon?

820
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,019
That could be it.

821
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:30,397
If he felt that he might have to say
goodbye to a close friend for good,

822
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:33,567
sensitive children like Dong-seok
will definitely have a hard time.

823
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,446
Could it have been
a mistake to go see his friend?

824
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,656
Not at all.

825
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:41,158
The most important thing is that we keep

826
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:44,245
building on
happy experiences for Dong-seok.

827
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,417
ART GROUP COUNSELING ROOM, HEART

828
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,303
Excuse me.

829
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:04,807
You dropped your scarf here.

830
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,156
We came to see a doctor
because Yu-bin kept on lying.

831
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,782
They said Dong-seok has selective mutism.

832
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,785
I must've given him too much stress.

833
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,372
How can our paths
be so intertwined like this?

834
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,209
Mom, I can't breathe too well.

835
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:16,295
No, my kid might die
if he has to wait that long. Dong-ju.

836
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,839
Dong-ju, wake up! Dong-ju!

837
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,841
-Did you ever check up on that thing?
-Oh, that lady?

838
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:23,302
We're not after the people
who took the drugs.

839
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:24,386
We're looking for the sellers.

840
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,847
Are you now bringing
gangsters into our house?

841
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,390
Hey, this is all your fault.

842
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:32,603
In life, knowing the truth
can be like poison sometimes.

843
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:36,232
It can be better to live your life
without knowing the whole story.

844
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:45,032
