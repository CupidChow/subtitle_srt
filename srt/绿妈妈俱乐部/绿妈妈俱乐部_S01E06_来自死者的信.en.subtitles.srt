00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,769
-What is it?
-What's going on?

2
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,733
Oh, no.

3
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,528
How could something like this
happen in our neighborhood?

FORENSICS

5
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,159
How could something like this
happen overnight?

6
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,208
Can somebody tell us what's going on?

7
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,053
-Is that the husband?
-Oh, my goodness.

8
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,722
Oh, no. What's he going to do?

9
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,277
Is he her husband?

10
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,201
-What's he going to do now?
-Oh, no.

11
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,245
-Shouldn't the police do something?
-I know.

12
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,130
Oh, my goodness. What's he going to do?

13
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,183
Someone fell and died here.

14
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,190
SEPTEMBER 23, FRIDAY

00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,901
WONDERFUL VIEWS' COMMUNITY

16
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,786
There are so many people.

17
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,496
The police are here and everything.

18
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,915
-Was it an accident?
-They're saying it's a suicide.

19
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,334
-Where?
-Jeez, what in the world happened?

20
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,294
-Where?
-Where is it?

21
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,928
Building 901. It's our building.

22
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,888
I heard it's someone from the 25th floor.

23
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,140
-The penthouse?
-What's going on?

24
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,350
Who is it?

25
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,478
-Apparently, she's young.
-The husband's outside checking it out.

26
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,729
The husband's crying.

27
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,147
-What about the kids?
-Oh, no.

28
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,732
-I know.
-This happened in our neighborhood?

Gathering information.

34
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,024
What happened?

35
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,695
Was it really Henry's mom?

36
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,327
I…

37
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,413
I think it's my fault.

38
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,583
Chun-hui.

39
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,962
I think it's all my fault.

40
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,721
It's because of me.

41
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,606
I think it's because of me.

42
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,415
What do I do?

EPISODE 6
A LETTER FROM THE DEAD

STILNOX
PSYCHOACTIVE DRUG

45
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,543
I actually…

46
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:16,258
was in a relationship with Louis
when I was in France.

47
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,845
But Jin-ha

48
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,849
kept getting the wrong idea
about the two of us.

49
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,060
So we had this huge fight

50
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,729
and I told her
I never wanted to see her again.

51
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,362
So…

52
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,200
the two of you
weren't seeing each other again?

53
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,953
No.

54
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,705
No, we weren't.

55
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,049
But…

56
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,052
Louis was looking

57
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,722
for a ghostwriter,

58
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,644
so we were working together.

59
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,274
If Jin-ha found out about it…

60
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,237
If that's the real reason why…

61
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,702
That means I'm responsible for Jin-ha's…

62
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,415
Dong-seok's mom!

63
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,131
Dong-seok's mom.

64
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,758
Here, breathe slowly.

65
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,511
Breathe slowly.
You're just hyperventilating.

66
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,305
Breathe slowly.

67
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,644
Are you okay?

68
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,813
Are you okay?

69
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,038
Chun-hui…

70
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:22,593
I'm so scared, Chun-hui.
I don't know what to do.

71
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,640
What do I do now?

72
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,436
-What do I do?
-Eun-pyo.

73
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,814
Eun-pyo.

74
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,317
Eun-pyo, look at me.

75
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,402
This isn't your fault.

76
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,821
It isn't your fault.

77
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,535
Even if you did anything wrong,
it isn't something to die over.

78
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,412
It was Henry's mom's choice.
It's not your fault.

79
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,289
So stop thinking like that, okay?

80
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,419
First…

81
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,008
Let's not tell anyone else
about what happened in the past.

82
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,177
Don't get too specific with the police,

83
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,556
and especially not
with any of the neighbors.

84
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,142
They will use this situation
to come up with all sorts of lies.

85
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,229
Try not to give anyone
something to be suspicious of, okay?

86
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,995
-Thank you.
-Have a good day.

87
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,706
Who was the first person on the scene?

88
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,958
I heard it was one of the residents.
One second.

89
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,418
It's fine. I'll figure it out.

90
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,007
According to the forensics team,
there wasn't any sign of forced entry.

91
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,508
No signs of struggle either.

92
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,094
It's difficult to get an estimated time
of death because of the rain.

93
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,681
But based on the bruises and stiffness,
I think it happened around 2 a.m.

94
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,766
The rain washed away all the traces.

95
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,894
If you look at where she dropped,

96
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,396
it seems like
she was completely out of it.

97
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,189
There was no sign of a will to survive.

98
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,443
We thought she might've drank,
but there were no traces of alcohol.

99
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,485
Okay.

100
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,654
Her child was young.
Why would she do this?

101
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,538
This is Senior Inspector Jung
from Major Crimes.

102
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,958
Are you sure this is the number
of the first person who reported?

103
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:23,839
SEON-HO'S MOM

104
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,426
CHANG-IK'S MOM

105
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,685
SEON-HO'S MOM
DID YOU SEE THE HUSBAND?

106
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,978
CHANG-IK'S MOM
WHAT IF THE HOUSE PRICES DROP?

107
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,823
PARK YUN-JU

108
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,283
SEON-HO'S MOM
HE'S REALLY TALL

109
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,302
ALMOST A STRANGER

110
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,019
Hey…

111
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,814
Hey, are you okay?
You must've been so shocked.

112
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,609
Why did you take out
the garbage at that time?

113
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,613
Eun-pyo, just calm down first.

114
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,241
If we have any relaxing pills
at home, take some.

115
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,495
You might be fine now,
but you might have nightmares later.

116
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,039
Okay.

117
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,627
I need your statement,
so come to the station.

118
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,296
Don't drive. Take a taxi, okay?

119
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,896
The number you have dialed
is not available…

120
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,816
Gosh, why isn't she picking up her phone?

121
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,443
What is it?

122
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,320
Eun-pyo was the first to report it!

123
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,489
What? Report what?

124
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,324
That…

125
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,455
Your boss' wife is dead.

126
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,874
They're saying
she jumped from the 25th floor.

127
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,127
Was she not close to her husband?
Did he not say anything while carpooling?

128
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,838
Gosh, what do I do?

129
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,006
Gosh.

130
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,102
YOU'VE ALL HEARD OF
THE PENTHOUSE GODDESS, RIGHT?

131
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,771
DO YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS POST?
DELETE

132
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,815
THE MOMS HERE ARE JUST
AS EXTREME AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD

133
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,484
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO LIVE
IN SANGWE-DONG BECAUSE OF SOME MOMS

134
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,568
YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY I DO

135
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,237
Are you talking about
the penthouse goddess?

136
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,948
Because that's exactly
what I think whenever I see her.

137
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,331
Aren't husbands always
on someone else's side?

138
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,543
The penthouse goddess goes around
with her husband like he's some accessory.

139
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,254
That's the kind of family
that's even more suspicious.

140
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,342
INCOMING CALL

141
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,137
Hello?

142
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,264
Did your boss ever mention

143
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,309
anything about his wife
when you guys went to work together?

144
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:05,853
Like what?

145
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,230
That they weren't getting along

146
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,649
or that she was feeling suicidal.

147
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,026
Did he mention anything like that?

148
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,153
Chun-hui.

149
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,113
Did you…

150
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,824
have anything to do with…

151
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,701
What are you talking about right now?

152
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:58,363
WE'LL BE CLOSING THE CHATROOM FOR
THE TIME BEING. EVERYONE, PLEASE LEAVE.

153
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:02,034
LEFT THE CHATROOM

154
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,639
Why did you do this?

155
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,189
How am I supposed to live now?

156
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,822
How can I ever see you again?

157
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,123
It's all my fault.

158
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,459
I'm sorry, Jin-ha.

159
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,545
I'm sorry.

160
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,380
It was my fault.

161
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,011
I'm just so heartbroken.

162
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:49,391
That poor, beautiful soul
came to us for help.

163
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,227
And what did we do?

164
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,605
It's…

165
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,816
How could she do that?

166
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,904
How could she make such a drastic decision
when she has a child to take care of?

167
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,949
-That's what I'm saying.
-She had everything.

168
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,118
You know how it is.

169
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,287
Isn't it obvious?

170
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,581
It is, isn't it?

171
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,208
He looks exactly like the type.

172
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,711
He's too good-looking.

173
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,299
-I feel so bad for the kid.
-Yes.

174
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,180
-Exactly.
-Men like that…

175
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,268
I can't stand to listen to
any more of your crass talk.

176
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,562
Please stop, will you?

177
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,982
What do you mean?

178
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,402
Do you really not know
why Henry's mom killed herself?

179
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,697
-How would I know that?
-Well, I do.

180
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:52,204
You guys were so jealous of her.
You badmouthed her and used her.

181
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,831
And now you're spreading fake news!

182
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,541
Do you have no shame?

183
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,585
What are you talking about?

184
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,713
Is it my fault that society is like this?

185
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,465
I should rip that snout off your face.

186
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,050
-Oh, my goodness.
-My gosh.

187
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,969
-Gosh, Yeong-mi.
-Stop talking nonsense.

188
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,930
-Oh, my goodness.
-How could you say that?

189
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:13,391
Oh, my gosh. You're so crass.
Don't get involved with them.

190
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,311
Do you think I'm some pushover?
They're ridiculous.

191
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,438
Excuse me, could we get a coffee refill?

192
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,233
-Gosh, they're pissing me off.
-My goodness.

193
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,193
-What a ridiculous lady.
-Breathe.

194
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,570
My goodness.

195
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,656
-Hi, Jae-bin's mom.
-Hey.

196
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,159
What in the world is going on?

197
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,955
I talked to her on the phone
the other day and she sounded fine.

198
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,164
But…

199
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,418
How could this happen?

200
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,099
INTERROGATION ROOM

201
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,611
I know this is difficult for you,

202
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:10,240
but if you don't cooperate,
it's going to drag out the investigation.

203
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:15,245
It seems like your wife had been taking
sleeping pills for a while.

204
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,334
Were you aware that
these pills have side effects?

205
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,922
I saw a record of an ambulance
being sent to your residence.

206
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:30,635
My wife took her sleeping pills
with alcohol.

207
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,681
What do you mean
they were not on good terms?

208
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,269
Even though she was quite sensitive,
he was always there for her,

209
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,897
and he mostly took care of the child.

210
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,443
Was there anyone
she was seeing more often than usual?

211
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,029
I'm not sure.

212
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,282
Right.

213
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,745
Sometimes a director from downstairs

214
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,496
would come up for an interview.

215
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,876
Thank you for everything today.

216
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,338
We'll let you know
if our investigation progresses.

217
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,757
You should get some rest at home.

218
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,009
We'll contact you again.

219
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,011
We appreciate your cooperation.

220
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,527
You must've been so shocked.

221
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,363
Yes.

222
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,406
I'm just going to ask simple questions.

223
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,326
So let me know if it's too hard, okay?

224
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,036
There was something…

225
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,873
that looked like a person

226
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,460
lying on the ground.

227
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,547
Something felt off,

228
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,467
so I walked closer to it.

229
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,469
But…

230
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,058
Eun-pyo.

231
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,520
It's okay, Eun-pyo. Calm down.

232
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,482
It's all right. Calm down.

233
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,664
Did you personally know the deceased?

234
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,209
Just because we're neighbors
doesn't mean we know everyone.

235
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,509
My oldest boy…

236
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,056
and her child are in the same class.

237
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,269
We're also…

238
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,148
friends from university.

239
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,649
-Really?
-Really?

240
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,655
Goodness.

241
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,784
What a coincidence…

242
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,039
Were you close?

243
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,541
No.

244
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,386
You did well. Don't take it too hard.

245
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,431
Sometimes life throws
all sorts of things at you.

246
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,477
Go home and get some rest first.

247
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,646
I'll get off work as soon as possible.

248
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,174
It's got to be rough for Eun-pyo.

249
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,760
Even if they weren't close,
they knew each other.

250
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,011
I know.

251
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,930
Darn it.

252
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:07,519
I never wanted my wife to see
the kind of things I have to see.

253
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,940
It's going to turn up as a suicide.

254
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,775
Did you hear how many times she tried?

255
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,194
Hey, don't make a hasty conclusion.

256
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,657
Get me the deceased's
phone call history by today.

257
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,699
Yes, sir.

258
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:25,203
-Did you check the CCTV footage?
-Hyeok-ho's working on that.

259
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:29,499
Check who visited their apartment last.

260
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,667
Yes, sir.

261
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,669
Let's go.

262
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,561
Dong-seok's mom?

263
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,324
I don't think it's a coincidence

264
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,202
that you were the one to see her.

265
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,875
Maybe it was her way
of calling out for the last time

266
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,377
before she left us.

267
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,254
Goodness.

268
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,261
-Hey, wait up.
-Come on.

269
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:36,524
Have Jin-ha's parents been informed?

270
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,693
Her father passed away.

271
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,612
Did you not know?

272
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,910
He passed away when she was in France,
so she never got to say goodbye.

273
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,455
Her current mom is a stepmother.

274
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,417
She came to visit
from time to time recently.

275
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,630
Goodness.

276
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:08,139
What's the point of being beautiful
and having all that money?

277
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:14,354
If there's a hole in your heart,
none of that means anything.

278
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,757
Goodness.

279
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,177
-All right.
-Thank you.

280
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,309
Hey! One, two, three, four!

281
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,811
-Good morning.
-Hello.

282
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,605
-Good morning.
-I'm on duty today.

283
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,650
-Hello, Detective.
-Hello, Reporter Kim.

284
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,403
-Tell me about the Wonderful Views case.
-We don't have anything right now.

285
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,363
I know about it. She's a famous person--

286
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,073
We don't have anything right now.

287
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,285
-Give me a call.
-Good morning.

288
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,453
Hey.

289
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,997
Did you tell Reporter Kim
about the Sangwe case?

290
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,916
No, maybe Hyeok-ho did.

291
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,210
Jeez, I really hope
nothing hits the papers yet.

292
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,339
We can't stop that.

293
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,799
Turns out that couple is pretty famous.

294
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,177
Did you find anything new?

295
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,930
Just like you said, she had a visitor.

296
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,723
Let's have a look.

297
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,435
Hey.

298
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,104
What did she do in that house
until one in the morning?

299
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,902
Wait, I've seen this woman before.

300
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,490
Wait a minute…

301
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,541
Why haven't you gotten ready?

302
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,683
Eun-pyo.

303
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,648
Eun-pyo.

304
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,317
Have you seen this?

305
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,113
2019 BALOISE ART PRIZE WINNER, SEO JIN-HA
DISCOVERED DEAD AT HOME

306
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,788
Did you hear about that person
who died at Wonderful Views?

307
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,789
Really?

308
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,458
I heard it was someone
in the penthouse in Building 901.

309
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,877
Really? That highly gifted kid's mom?

310
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,962
Yes.

311
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,965
But why would she kill herself?
She has everything.

312
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,634
I heard she had depression
because she was an outcast.

313
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,804
Really? I heard that
her husband cheated on her.

314
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,056
It's pretty obvious.

315
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:39,892
Excuse me.

316
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,355
Even if she's a stranger, she's a mother
with a child the same age as ours.

317
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:48,693
Try not to spread rumors
when you don't even know what happened.

318
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,925
GEOSEONG UNIVERSITY SCHOOL
AFFILIATED GIFTED STUDENTS CENTER

319
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,304
Hello. You've all been waiting
for a while, haven't you?

320
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,680
-Yes.
-Yes.

321
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,849
The admissions test

322
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:23,436
for Geoseong University School for Gifted
Students is right around the corner.

323
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,896
Are you all nervous?

324
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,482
-Yes.
-There's no need to be nervous.

325
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,776
Why are you shaking so much?

326
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,403
Are you trying to tell the world
that you made a mistake?

327
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,239
I'm sorry.

328
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,284
I understand that you're out of it.

329
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,702
I do.

330
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,874
But are you going to let that
petty guilt ruin our children's lives?

331
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,295
I understand.

332
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,131
I'll get myself together.

333
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,433
I have somewhere to stop by.

334
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,103
Take Yu-bin with you
when she's done with class.

335
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,813
You can watch her for a bit, right?

336
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,483
I'm sorry.

337
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,826
I'm sorry.

338
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,620
That day…

339
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,207
I shouldn't have left like that.

340
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,128
I just feel so bad…

341
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,507
But…

342
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,219
why did you visit her so late at night?

343
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,145
The truth is…

344
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,482
we know each other through our children.

345
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:39,238
Henry's mom and I were not that close.

346
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,366
But for some reason,

347
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,453
she called me that day.

348
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,957
She said she was feeling down

349
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,710
and asked if I wanted to come over.

350
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,378
And?

351
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,969
She held onto me

352
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,805
and cried for a long time.

353
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:10,519
She was telling me how hard her life was.

354
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,315
And that she kept thinking of her mom.

355
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,609
Her mom?

356
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,403
Yes.

357
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,282
When Henry's mom was in middle school,

358
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:30,289
her mother…

359
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,920
committed suicide.

360
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,554
Thank you for your cooperation today.

361
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,392
So…

362
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,980
how are you proceeding
with the investigation?

363
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,649
We have to start looking into it more.

364
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:02,196
Do you think it could be a murder case?

365
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,534
We're not sure yet.

366
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,747
-Thank you for your hard work.
-No problem.

367
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,256
Gosh.

368
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,134
I've definitely seen
that woman somewhere before.

369
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,635
Where did I see her?

370
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,265
I remember!

371
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,893
She came to the station with Eun-pyo
when they got wasted last time.

372
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:39,108
-Really? What kind?
-I want to see the letter!

373
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,031
Letters!

374
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,741
Goodness.

375
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,617
You're dropping everything.

376
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:58,294
I love coming to your house
because I can watch as much TV as I want.

377
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,047
I want to watch it too.

378
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:06,469
-What is this?
-What is that? That's the plate thing.

379
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,472
Does it have something to do with cooking?

380
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,349
What do you think is in there?

381
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,809
-What is it?
-One, two, three!

382
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,771
-What is that?
-Gosh, what is that?

383
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,232
What's that?

384
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:26,489
-That's really big.
-That's huge.

385
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,698
I know.

386
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,158
What's that?

387
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,369
That's really big.

388
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,038
But with all of that, that one's bigger.

389
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,456
MS. LEE EUN-PYO

390
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,878
I bet it takes super long to wear that.

391
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,213
Right?

392
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,924
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR WICKED DEEDS
EVEN IN DEATH

393
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,677
You…

394
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,224
wish I would just disappear, don't you?

395
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,607
BYEON CHUN-HUI

396
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,044
Remember that day you got drunk
and ended up at the station?

397
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,547
You're still in contact
with that person, right?

398
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,425
Why?

399
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:32,054
She was the last person
Seo Jin-ha met on the day she died.

400
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,766
Did she tell you anything?

401
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,060
Are you close with her?

402
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,442
Eun-pyo, are you there?

403
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,194
No, I haven't heard anything.

404
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,988
All right.

405
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,003
This is so fun.

406
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,212
What is that?

407
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,926
I'm good at that.

408
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,927
That's so big.

409
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,304
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR WICKED DEEDS
EVEN IN DEATH

410
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,263
BYEON CHUN-HUI

411
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:19,101
You should be careful around Yu-bin's mom.

412
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:25,357
She sort of has a dark side to her.

413
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,664
ALMOST A STRANGER

414
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,375
BYEON CHUN-HUI

415
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,893
What's wrong?

416
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,396
What's going on?
Did you start to get anxious again?

417
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,946
I thought it was a flier
so I opened it. I'm sorry.

418
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,742
BYEON CHUN-HUI

419
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,831
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR WICKED DEEDS
EVEN IN DEATH

420
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,254
Where did you get this?

421
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,716
Where did you get this?

422
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,802
Something happened
between you and Jin-ha, right?

423
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,016
Jin-ha sent this, didn't she?

424
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,894
What are you talking about right now?

425
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,689
I heard you were the last
to meet Jin-ha before she died.

426
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,401
What were you doing there?
What did the two of you talk about?

427
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,777
Why didn't you tell me?

428
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,279
How…

429
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,906
did you know about that?

430
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,911
Are you keeping tabs on me?

431
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,426
Lee Eun-pyo.

432
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:19,930
I know that your guilt
is messing with you,

433
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,143
but it's really low that you'd try to
place the blame on someone else.

434
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,272
I'll tell you what we talked about
since you're so curious.

435
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,899
She said she wanted to
kill herself because of you.

436
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,446
She cried thinking that
you and her husband slept together.

437
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,906
Don't lie.

438
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,744
Does denying it make you feel any better?

439
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,834
But what about this letter--

440
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,836
Think about it.

441
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:56,133
Do you think Henry's mom is the only one
who would send me a letter like this?

442
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,969
I'm surrounded by enemies.

443
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,221
Don't you know that?

444
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:15,694
And here I was looking out for you.

445
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:19,114
Getting treated like a criminal
really makes me feel like crap.

446
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:24,119
This must be why people always say
you should be careful of who you help.

447
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,547
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR WICKED DEEDS
EVEN IN DEATH

448
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,255
Guys.

449
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,757
When the interviewers ask questions,

450
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,302
don't be nervous
and just confidently speak up, okay?

451
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,595
-Okay.
-Okay.

452
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,848
Okay, great!

453
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,599
You've got this!

454
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:30,853
Jeez, I'm getting so nervous.

455
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,730
It's not like
I can take the test for them.

456
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:39,236
Did you and Yu-bin's mom
finish the project?

457
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:40,696
Yes.

458
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,115
Really?

459
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,951
That's interesting.

460
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,038
What's interesting?

461
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,417
It's just…

462
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,297
Give it to me straight.

463
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,923
What's so interesting about that?

464
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,472
I don't like her.

465
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,141
Why not?

466
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:12,227
You get along well with her,

467
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,813
so I didn't want to say anything.

468
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,983
She's a scary person.

469
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,068
I heard from a mom from an upper grade

470
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,155
that they had to move out
because they got on her bad side.

471
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,531
Either way, just be careful.

472
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,910
2022 ELEMENTARY INTENSIVE COURSE
GIFTED STUDENT SELECTION TEST ROOM GUIDE

473
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,289
-Hello. Her name is Lee Su-in.
-Lee Su-in?

474
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,083
-Su-in, hold onto this.
-We have you checked in.

475
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,877
-Thank you.
-No problem.

476
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,504
-Hello.
-Next person, please.

477
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,964
-Next person, please.
-Mom!

478
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:41,882
Right.

479
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,051
-Your test ID?
-Here you go.

480
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,052
Thank you.

481
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,471
-Jung Dong-seok.
-Hello.

482
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,223
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

483
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,140
Thank you.

484
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:02,736
All right, numbers 181 through 200
can head into the test room.

485
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:06,114
No other personal belongings are allowed
except for pencils and erasers.

486
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,699
Numbers 181 through 200,

487
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:11,036
please grab your test ID
and head into room 503.

488
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,997
-Do your best, okay?
-Okay. I'll be back.

489
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,541
-You got this!
-Do your best.

490
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,417
Su-in. Give me a kiss.

491
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,838
-You got this.
-Okay.

492
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,841
Chun-hui.

493
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,760
I need to talk to you.

494
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,598
Yes.

495
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,393
I did visit her
a few times for research purposes.

496
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:41,066
He's actually a recipient
of the Naughterland Trophy,

497
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,569
which he won for his film
The Flag of That Day.

498
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,529
That's what he means by research.

499
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:46,863
I see.

500
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,993
Can you tell me what kind of conversations
you had with the deceased?

501
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,871
There wasn't much.

502
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,291
Do you know what tapestry is?

503
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,375
Sorry?

504
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,711
-Not really…
-Right.

505
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,213
I asked about tapestries.

506
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,882
And since we both have
a background in arts,

507
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,010
the conversations just flowed naturally.

508
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,597
But detectives,

509
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,101
with all due respect,
I'd like to say one thing.

510
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:20,856
The death of Henry's mom was a catastrophe
caused by the collapse of the community.

511
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,734
Henry's mother was very good-hearted.

512
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,611
She always thought it was unfortunate

513
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,196
that this neighborhood
had fallen ill to egotism.

514
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,617
But everyone judged her
based on her outward appearance

515
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,411
and constantly distorted her words.

516
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:38,624
All those distorted gazes
from people took a toll on Henry's mom.

517
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,585
Which is why I think
there was such an accident.

518
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,671
And about the future plans
for the community…

519
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,803
I want to…

520
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,473
apologize for my behavior.

521
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,064
I was too emotional.

522
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,941
I jumped to conclusions too fast.

523
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,277
I'm sorry.

524
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,239
But…

525
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,910
I'd like to know

526
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,204
exactly why you went
to see Jin-ha at that hour

527
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:21,249
and what she told you.

528
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,337
Did she really…

529
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,340
say that I was the reason

530
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,843
she wanted to kill herself?

531
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,428
Before that…

532
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,309
Where did you hear it from?

533
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,648
That I was the last one to see her.

534
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:54,408
Did she call you or something?

535
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,203
Or was it Henry's father?

536
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,754
I heard it from my husband.

537
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,175
Actually, my husband is…

538
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,762
a policeman.

539
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,225
A policeman?

540
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,853
2022 GEOSEONG UNIVERSITY SCHOOL
FOR GIFTED CHILDREN APPLICATION FORM

541
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:23,770
PERSONAL STATEMENT

542
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,356
-Ms. Kim Yu-bin.
-Yes, ma'am.

543
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,860
There's a classroom with 28 students.

544
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:34,197
If you could rearrange their seats
in any way, how would you do it?

545
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:40,579
I would divide the group into quarters
and have seven students in each.

546
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:44,166
INTERVIEWER

547
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,962
-Mr. Jung Dong-seok.
-Yes, ma'am.

548
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:54,509
If there was only one thing
you could take to a desert,

549
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,261
what would it be?

550
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:01,933
Moss.

551
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:04,686
Why?

552
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,355
Because I want to turn
the entire desert green.

553
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,193
The thing with moss is that
even with just their rhizoids,

554
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,779
they can absorb all the dew.

555
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,531
The temperature difference in the desert
between day and night is big.

556
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,950
That means a lot of dew forms.

557
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,121
So I want to take moss and help it grow.

558
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:28,043
Don't you think it would be cool
if the whole desert was covered in moss?

559
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,377
We were threatened

560
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:33,465
by a criminal in our old neighborhood.

561
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,258
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

562
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,804
I wasn't trying to deceive you.

563
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:47,646
So what did Jin-ha say exactly?

564
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,731
Did she…

565
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,776
really say it was because of me?

566
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,822
I'm so upset that I don't even
have the words right now.

567
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:01,785
So you're telling me everything
that you told me was a lie?

568
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,204
Everything including where he works?

569
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,164
Forget it.

570
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:10,544
I'm so disappointed in you
and I don't want to talk anymore.

571
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:15,340
Don't call me from now on, okay?

572
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,676
Chun-hui.

573

PICNIC WITH EUN-PYO!

575
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:55,088
I HOPE OUR FRIENDSHIP LASTS FOREVER
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, EUN-PYO

576
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,515
Based on the results
from the forensics team,

577
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,977
there weren't any specific signs
of it being a homicide.

578
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,438
-In cases like this--
-Please do the autopsy.

579
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,738
There are too many things
that just don't add up.

580
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,158
Her exhibition was a success.

581
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,744
She also wanted to show
her work at the Venice Biennale.

582
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,705
We even had plans to meet up.

583
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,917
Why would someone make plans
if they wanted to take their own life?

584
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,635
Something is also off about her husband.

585
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,178
He's too calm.

586
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,972
How can someone be so rational
when their wife just died?

587
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,850
He runs a pharmaceutical company.

588
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,311
He could've drugged her

589
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,855
or he could've been
slowly poisoning her in secret.

590
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,524
But…

591
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,110
is it true

592
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,864
that the mother of the deceased
also committed suicide?

593
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,325
Where…

594
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,787
did you hear that?

595
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,418
She's not even the real mom.

596
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,253
Why is so convinced it was a homicide?

597
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,506
It's clear as day that it was a suicide.

598
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,050
It doesn't hurt to keep
all the possibilities open.

599
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,594
Her fortune is enormous

600
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,639
so she could be worried that
her son-in-law might take all of it.

601
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:32,519
Or it could be true that there weren't
any signs of suicide at all.

602
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,896
Or…

603
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,149
maybe it has to do with
some kind of guilt.

604
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,651
Guilt?

605
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,277
Goodness.

606
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,651
What about the funeral?

607
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:25,113
They said I have to wait
until the investigation is over.

608
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,746
Where's Henry?

609
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,373
He's with his grandmother.

610
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,845
Why are you here to see me?

611
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,894
Please let her get in.

612
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,645
Please…

613
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:01,441
I'm praying, please.

614
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,487
You can do this.

615
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,030
All right.

616
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,114
You can do this.

617
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,407
Goodness.

GEOSEONG UNIVERSITY SCHOOL
FOR GIFTED STUDENTS APPLICATION RESULTS

619
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:30,428
I'm well aware…

620
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,933
that asking you this

621
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:41,397
might be really cruel.

622
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,278
But I can't live my life

623
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,615
without knowing.

624
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:55,745
I heard that Jin-ha…

625
00:56:57,622 --> 00:57:01,376
had the wrong idea about the two of us

626
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,296
and that she wanted to
kill herself because of that.

627
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,800
Is that true?

628
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,517
Did…

629
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:24,107
my harsh words

630
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,776
lead Jin-ha to…

631
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,319
Why does any of that matter now?

632
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,572
What if it's true and what if it's not?

633
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:33,575
It already happened
and we can't take back anything!

634
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,912
Jin-ha isn't here anymore.

635
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:42,500
If we say it's all our fault,
will it bring her back to life?

636
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,256
Fine.

637
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,134
I killed her.

638
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,970
Yes, it was me!

639
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,197
I'm sorry.

PARK YUN-JU

641
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,725
Congratulations, Su-in's mom.

642
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:43,061
-Thank you.
-You must be so happy.

643
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,479
She did it all on her own.

644
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,231
You must be so happy.

645
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,281
Eun-pyo!
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

646
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,741
Where are you coming from?

00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:57,909
Nowhere.

648
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,623
You cried. You were crying, right?

649
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,376
No.

650
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,920
Anyway, what's going on?

651
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,046
What?

652
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,131
You haven't heard, have you?

653
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,466
Eun-pyo…

654
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,928
Both our kids got accepted.

655
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,888
What?

656
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,641
Geoseong University
School for Gifted Students!

657
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,062
Do you know what's even more amazing?

658
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,734
Only our kids got accepted.

659
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,237
The rest got rejected, including Yu-bin.

660
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,076
Goodness. Aren't you happy?

661
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:46,916
Hello? Dong-seok passed the test.

662
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:50,712
Yu-bin got rejected?

663
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:00,513
This is all useless!

664
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,225
I tried so hard.

665
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,562
I worked so hard every single day!

666
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,361
Let go of me!

667
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,114
Put your shoes on.
I said put your shoes on.

668
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:22,201
If you don't want to study,
let's go cancel all your academy classes.

669
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,995
Who said I didn't want to study?

670
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:28,541
Sometimes you do well on a test,
and sometimes you don't.

671
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,252
Do you really have to rip up
all your textbooks like that?

672
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,212
Who said it was because of that?

673
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,339
Then what is it?

674
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,424
I did everything you told me to.

675
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,801
I never went out to play with my friends.

676
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,763
I didn't even watch any TV.

677
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,431
Why did I get rejected?

678
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,934
Why am I the only one who got rejected?

679
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,652
Dong-seok got accepted.

680
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,071
Su-in also got accepted.

681
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,324
I'm the only one who got rejected!

682
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:06,621
This is unfair.

683
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:12,085
This is so unfair. I can't stand it, Mom.

684
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,255
This is so unfair.

685
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:23,930
This is hilarious.

686
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,224
Where's Yeong-bin?

687
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,019
At the academy.

688
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,188
At a time like this?

689
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,315
Jeez.

690
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,486
I wonder if you see any results
after investing so much in them.

691
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:41,531
Talk about pouring water
into a broken vase.

692
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,371
This is hilarious.

693
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:54,877
You acted as if you knew
everything about our kids' education.

694
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,799
This is amazing.

695
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,768
Goodness. What's this?

696
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,398
Gosh, this is hilarious.

697
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,317
We'll have the beef galbi.

698
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,153
Two plates of beef galbi…

699
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,865
-Three plates, please.
-Sure.

700
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,744
Mom, I don't have to eat beef galbi.

701
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,996
I like pork galbi more.

702
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,707
Gosh, my daughter.

703
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,710
You passed such a hard test.

704
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:40,047
You don't think we can afford
to buy our precious girl some beef?

705
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,057
Do you think it's a waste of money?

706
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,685
Not at all.

707
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,648
I raised her better.

708
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,779
I got ours in while she couldn't.

709
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:07,950
So Su-in and I deserve to eat beef.

710
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,078
Of course, you do.

711
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,539
Eat as much as you want.

712
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,834
Don't cry, Mom.

713
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:21,255
And thank you. It's all thanks to you.

714
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,382
Goodness.

715
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:27,303
Our daughter knows
how to say such kind words.

716
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,809
Who do you take after
that makes you so nice?

717
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:33,726
Mom.

718
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,691
Excuse me, ma'am.

719
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:46,697
Could you cancel our order

720
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,158
and give us two plates of pork?

721
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,326
No, ma'am.

722
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:53,830
We'll go with three plates of beef
and we'll have two beers as well.

723
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,544
Gosh, I'm so proud of our daughter.

724
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,963
Come give your dad a hug.

725
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:03,673
Come here.

726
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:06,259
My gosh.

727
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:10,429
I'm so thankful that you studied so hard.

728
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,437
Are you looking for a birthday cake?

729
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,565
Oh, it's not for a birthday.

730
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:24,151
My son actually got accepted to
a school for gifted students.

731
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,444
Only 1 out of 15 students get in.

732
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,573
Goodness me!

733
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,450
-He must be a very smart boy.
-Gosh.

734
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,035
What kind of cake would you like?

735
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,745
-Oh, the cake.
-Something big?

736
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,123
That one's good,
but my son likes strawberries.

737
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,624
-Strawberries?
-This one looks good.

738
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,709
-This one?
-Yes.

739
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,462
Chun-hui.

740
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,923
What are you doing here alone?

741
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:47,592
Hey.

742
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:48,593
What about you guys?

743
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,137
We're going for a drink
because we're frustrated.

744
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,516
I wasn't expecting much from Jae-bin,

745
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,394
but getting rejected
still doesn't feel very good.

746
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:01,230
But it must be worse for you, right?

747
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:03,816
What do you mean?

748
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:09,196
None of us expected
Yu-bin would get rejected.

749
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,866
On top of that,
Su-in and Dong-seok got accepted.

750
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:16,245
It's like you did all the work
and they got the credit.

751
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:21,042
Don't take it the wrong way.

752
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,335
Chun-hui.

753
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:26,756
She was so busy looking out
for her after ditching us,

754
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:28,758
and look what happened to her.

755
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,928
-You should stick close to me.
-Gosh, let's just go drink.

756
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,558
MONDE DU PAIN BAKERY

757
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,523
Oh, hello.

758
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,113
Hello.

759
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,491
Do you live in the building?

760
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,743
I live here as well.

761
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:57,662
I see.

762
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:21,602
What floor are you on?

763
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,732
The 16th floor.

764
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,568
You live right in front of us.

765
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,406
I wonder why we never
ran into each other before.

766
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:38,536
I did have a lot of cases
as soon as we moved in.

767
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:40,746
I probably made it home
less than once a week.

768
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:43,457
Today,

769
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,626
my son got into…

770
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,420
What was it called?

771
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,754
School for gifted students?

772
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:53,092
He got accepted and my wife
kept telling me to come home early.

773
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,094
Right.

774
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,430
You know my wife, right?

775
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,126
Excuse me.

776
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:29,503
Yes?

777
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,465
About Seo Jin-ha…

778
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,550
There's actually

779
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,012
something that I didn't mention.

780
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,349
It was so personal

781
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,686
that I wasn't sure
if I should tell you or not…

782
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,813
Not at all. Please tell me.

783
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,149
Tips like that are really helpful
for our investigation.

784
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,446
Henry's mom said…

785
01:07:56,489 --> 01:08:01,660
her husband was having an affair
so she wanted to kill herself.

786
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,371
And she said

787
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:07,750
something about the mistress
being a university friend.

788
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:14,256
She mentioned that she recently
ran into her in the neighborhood.

789
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:20,346
Would something like this
be helpful for the investigation?

790
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,319
Why did you bring such a big bag when you
were visiting the next building that day?

791
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:21,699
Actually, I met Henry's mom that night.

792
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:25,536
I heard you had an affair
with Henry's mom's husband.

793
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:28,122
How could you make me
a mistress overnight?

794
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,166
What did I ever do to you?

795
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:34,503
But I can't help but feel
that Yu-bin's mom is lying.

796
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,548
Why did you lie to me?

797
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:40,634
If you ever lock the door again,
I'll lock you up forever.

798
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:44,096
Don't you know that we'll get
in deep trouble if we continue right now?

799
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,641
-You killed her. Bring her back!
-She didn't kill your daughter.

800
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:52,062
My broken pride
kept telling me to do that.

801
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:57,276
