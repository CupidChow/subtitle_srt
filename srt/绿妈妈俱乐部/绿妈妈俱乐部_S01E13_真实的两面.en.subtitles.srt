1
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,991
Rhéa? Are you up already?

2
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,995
I've been up for a while now.

3
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,502
What are you doing? Are you busy?

4
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,921
No, I've got time.

5
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,714
Hey…

6
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,967
Do you know…

7
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,094
how beautiful this place is?

8
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,345
What?

9
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,476
I'm in Seoul right now.

10
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,130
What's going on?

11
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,008
I just missed you.

12
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,407
What's wrong?

13
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,867
Didn't you miss me?

14
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,746
Yes. Of course, I did.

15
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,824
I couldn't bear it.

16
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,287
I couldn't bear it
because I missed you so much.

17
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,581
Professor, wait.

18
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,043
Are you really not going to tell me?

19
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,922
I told you.

20
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,801
This guy I know sent it
because of reasons I can't disclose.

21
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,013
But I didn't send it to anyone but him.

22
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,056
Who's the guy then?

23
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,600
I can't tell you that.

24
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,019
Why not?

25
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,645
Are you protecting a criminal?

26
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,231
Criminal? It's not like that, Professor.

27
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,819
Delete it right now.

28
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,195
You too.

29
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,876
Who else did you send it to?

30
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,295
Just him. No one else.

31
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:41,591
If you did, tell them all to delete it.

32
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,510
I won't let it slide
if I ever see that photo again.

33
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,720
Do you understand?

34
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,156
EPISODE 13
THE TWO FACES OF TRUTH

35
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,507
Hey, kids. Daddy's home.

36
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,758
Dad!

37
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,094
My baby. Did you have a nice day?

38
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,929
Did you watch the house, Dong-seok?

39
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,098
How was your lecture?

40
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,809
What's that smell?

41
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,936
Oh, no!

42
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,232
Oh, dear.

43
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,067
Didn't you notice the smell?

44
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,403
No.

45
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,088
Jae-ung.

46
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,173
Yes?

47
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:51,471
You know how people's photos
get leaked online these days.

48
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,638
Yes.

49
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,349
If…

50
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,020
someone who saw them
reports it to the police,

51
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,897
do you investigate it?

52
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,024
It depends.

53
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,236
Usually, the victim makes the report
and the cybercrime team investigates.

54
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,157
What if the victim is dead?

55
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,326
Then their family would sue.

56
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,916
Why do you ask?

57
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,251
Did it happen to someone you know?
A celebrity?

58
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,754
It's nothing.

59
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,988
WECHILD COUNSELING CENTER

60
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,198
Hello.

61
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,294
You texted, right?

62
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,381
Sorry, I was busy and I forgot.

63
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,307
What is it?

64
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,935
Is something wrong?

65
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,700
What is it?

66
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:41,038
I saw a preposterous photo yesterday.

67
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,712
My hands were shaking
and I couldn't do anything.

68
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,800
I didn't ask a lot of questions.
I just told them to delete it and left.

69
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,803
I wish I had asked more about it,
but I was so taken aback.

70
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,098
And then when I went home,
I couldn't sleep a wink.

71
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,934
I can't tell Louis
because it would be too cruel.

72
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,645
But it's driving me crazy
to just leave it.

73
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,655
Eun-pyo.

74
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,075
Just forget about it.

75
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,874
Honestly, I don't think you should
get yourself involved in this issue.

76
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,002
Strictly speaking,
it's Henry's mother's personal life.

77
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,712
We don't know

78
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,298
how that photo was taken.

79
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,594
Don't you think Louis would want

80
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,929
to keep only beautiful memories of her?

81
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,265
Then what about Jin-ha?

82
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,061
She might be dead, but she still
deserves to have her dignity preserved.

83
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,021
You'd be making life hell for people

84
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,898
who are still here to protect
a dead woman's dignity.

85
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,572
I know you feel uneasy.

86
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,825
But people talk about things easily
and forget them easily.

87
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,788
As time goes by,
everyone will forget about it.

88
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,917
It'd be less painful for everyone
if you just leave this as is.

89
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,889
Don't let it bother you too much.
It'll all blow over soon.

90
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,475
Get going, Chun-hui.

91
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,310
-All right.
-Bye.

92
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,520
Let's go, Yu-bin.

93
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,438
Bye, Dong-seok.

94
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,648
Bye.

95
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,799
I'm sorry.

96
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,260
I've been so distracted today.

97
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,429
How was playtime?

98
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,390
I guess it wasn't too bad.

99
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,558
Good job, son.

100
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,103
Let's go.

101
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,697
Mom, aren't we going to go?

102
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,907
We are.

103
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,627
Thank you.

104
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,722
-He took this photo in secret.
-Really?

105
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,141
-I'm the only one who knows about this.
-Send it to me too.

106
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,767
I'll send it to you later.

107
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,478
-Not this one…
-Do you have more?

108
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,438
-This one and…
-This one.

109
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,315
This is so…

110
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,441
What's this?

111
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,901
-I'll send it to you later.
-You have to.

112
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,195
-I told the others about it.
-This is great.

113
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,197
-Is this real?
-I know.

114
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,074
-This is crazy.
-Jeez.

115
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,327
What are you two laughing at?

116
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,661
-Sorry?
-Sorry?

117
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,499
Never mind.

118
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,671
-It just gets funnier.
-Send me this one.

119
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,275
Just tell me
where you got that photo from.

120
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,361
I told you, I can't.

121
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,571
Is he her boyfriend or something?

122
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,201
Professor.

123
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,745
It's his personal life.

124
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,836
You really haven't sent it to anyone else?

125
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,213
No.

126
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,548
Do you mean it?

127
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,591
Yes!

128
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,680
Fine.

129
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,015
I'll take your word for it.

130
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:16,981
By the way,

131
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,526
you're aware that
this is a serious crime, right?

132
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,154
It's a serious criminal offense that
falls under defamation of the deceased.

133
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,330
Eun-pyo.

134
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,000
Are you here for a lecture?

135
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,043
Hello.

136
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,753
It's the holidays.
What are you doing here?

137
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:44,174
I know I coast by as the chairman,
but I still have to attend meetings.

138
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,138
Are you free the day after tomorrow?

139
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,601
It's my job to butter up
those old professors, you know.

140
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,729
We all have lunch together every holiday,

141
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,399
and it just happens that the deans of
the fine arts college are coming that day.

142
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:09,408
Well, I'm just a part-time lecturer,
so I'm not sure I'd belong there.

143
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,493
Don't worry about that.

144
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,121
You got a great score
for your lecture evaluation.

145
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,707
It's time to promote yourself
and carve out a spot of your own here.

146
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,880
Give them the strawberry juice I made.

147
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,215
It's in the fridge.
No soda or anything like that.

148
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,801
Okay.

149
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,972
Don't sleep the whole day away
and play with Dong-seok, okay?

150
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:32,973
Okay.

151
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,141
Put Dong-seok on.

152
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,225
Just a minute.

153
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,811
Dong-seok, it's Mom.

154
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,274
Dong-seok, I'll try to finish work quickly
and get home soon,

155
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,818
then I'll read you lots of storybooks.

156
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,612
I love you, son.

157
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,699
See you later.

158
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,784
Bye.

159
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,542
Come on in.

160
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,004
I hope I'm not late.

161
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,171
You're not.

162
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,966
The professors got here early.
They're just chatting.

163
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,719
Jeez, you shouldn't have.

164
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,886
It's nothing big.

165
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,098
It's the holidays
and the old fogies have nothing to do,

166
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,933
so they all got here way too early.

167
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,102
-Take it.
-Jeez.

168
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,729
Professors.

169
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,022
-Yes.
-Right.

170
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,692
This is Ms. Lee Eun-pyo.

171
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,486
She's teaching in place of
Professor Jang since he's unwell.

172
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,739
It's an honor to meet you all.

173
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,742
-Come here and have a drink.
-Okay.

174
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,410
-This way.
-Here, right here.

175
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,162
-Take a seat.
-Okay.

176
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,248
-We were having a glass of wine.
-I see.

177
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,043
-You got started already.
-We did.

178
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,421
-Here.
-Here, have some bread.

179
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,965
Here's some salad for Professor Park.

180
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,383
It's delicious.

181
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,093
-Do you like it?
-It's great.

182
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,845
That's good. Enjoy.

183
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,388
Thank you for the meal.

184
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,098
-This steak is rare.
-Yes.

185
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,558
Yes, it's nice.

186
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:46,648
Ms. Lee, where did you study
for your undergraduate degree?

187
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,902
I told you. She studied painting
at Geoseong University.

188
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,029
Their painting department
is famous, you know.

189
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,238
That's right.

190
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,575
Lots of talented graduates who are
great at both fine arts and design.

191
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,163
I'm just reaping the benefits

192
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,083
from the achievements of those before me.

193
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,667
I can only be grateful for them.

194
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,711
How modest.

195
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,298
Don't you want to paint again?

196
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,884
I'm afraid I'm nowhere
near talented enough.

197
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,010
Oh, please.

198
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,055
But I'm glad I have the experience.

199
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,850
I can understand the painstaking effort
that artists put into their works.

200
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,563
What a nice turn of phrase you have.

201
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,150
That artist who sadly
passed away recently.

202
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,153
-Right.
-Seo Jin-ha also majored there, right?

203
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,488
She did.

204
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,199
She was a great artist
who would've done the country proud.

205
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,534
What a shame.

206
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,996
-Isn't her father the painter Seo In-seo?
-Right.

207
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,249
He fell in love with his pupil

208
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,043
who was more than 20 years
younger than him,

209
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,379
and his wife jumped from
the top of a building.

210
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,588
Goodness, really?

211
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:56,260
It was a huge scandal
in the art world at the time.

212
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,638
His father-in-law
was a minister or something.

213
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:03,684
So there was an enormous ruckus
when his daughter died like that.

214
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,770
Mr. Seo is very handsome.

215
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,773
And now there's another big scandal.

216
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,443
I wonder if philandering
is passed down in the genes too.

217
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,905
Professors. Have you seen it?

218
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,198
-Seen what?
-What?

219
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,827
I heard Ms. Seo had an affair.

220
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,705
-What?
-What are you talking about?

221
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,500
Never mind.

222
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,419
I shouldn't, it's not polite.

223
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,172
Come on, what is it?

224
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:38,260
It'd be ruder to bring something up
and not follow through.

225
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,511
Right.

226
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,346
Really?

227
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,566
You know Professor Han, right?
The affiliate professor in painting.

228
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,029
-He sent me this in secret.
-What is it?

229
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,781
It seemed like they were madly
in love so they took photos.

230
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,866
Goodness.

231
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,286
I don't know why people these days
take this sort of photo.

232
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,914
You might be in love now,
but who knows what will happen?

233
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,583
-Give me that.
-Here.

234
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,128
She looks like she's really enjoying it.

235
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,173
Goodness, Professor.
How closely did you look?

236
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,137
So is this why
she did something so drastic?

237
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,764
Maybe.

238
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,850
Then she shouldn't have taken a photo
like that in the first place.

239
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,060
How indiscreet.

240
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,479
That's what I'm saying.

241
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,149
She shouldn't have let her
momentary pleasure lead to misjudgment.

242
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,442
It's so indiscreet.

243
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,527
Goodness.

244
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,987
Right.

245
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,908
Ms. Lee's around Ms. Seo's age.

246
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,660
Were you two in the same year?

247
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,329
Did I misspeak in front of her friend?

248
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,210
Yes.

249
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,003
What?

250
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,756
She was my friend.

251
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:02,094
We were in the same year
and we were friends since middle school.

252
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,346
Goodness, really?

253
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,850
Then I bet you know more. Is it true
that Ms. Seo was having an affair?

254
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,687
Who was the man?

255
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,566
As far as I know, there wasn't anyone.

256
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,072
I'm sorry, but…

257
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,908
could you please delete that photo?

258
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,247
Oh…

259
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,958
Did I offend you?

260
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,045
I just got it from Professor Han,
so I thought it might be true.

261
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,719
You're a bit sly, aren't you?

262
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,263
You should've told me earlier
that you were her friend.

263
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,974
Why did you just listen to me go on?
I feel so embarrassed.

264
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,642
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:01,361
I guess it's wrong to be on the
receiving end of these things these days.

266
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,781
Professor Lee.

267
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,909
Look. I'm deleting it.

268
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,663
I deleted it. See?

269
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,710
All right.

270
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:20,339
The deceased have their dignity too.

271
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,258
That's right.

272
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,553
I can't believe Professor Han did that.

273
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,638
How can he send photos like that?

274
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,271
-Let's eat.
-Right, let's eat.

275
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,863
I'm going to the bathroom.

276
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,459
I thought she was all right,

277
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,087
but I see she can't read the room.

278
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,590
Young people these days are all the same.

279
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,796
It's me.

280
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,966
I need to talk to you
about something in person.

281
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,766
Are you crazy?
Why are you telling me this just now?

282
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,310
Darn it.

283
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,437
Why would you show it to them?

284
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,274
I told you not to show anyone else
and keep your mouths shut!

285
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,862
Just be quiet and wait.

286
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,738
Wait.

287
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:11,950
Hey.

288
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,660
Never mind.

289
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,745
What's her name again?

290
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,249
LEE EUN-PYO

291
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,711
Lee Eun-pyo…

292
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,853
So what did you say?

293
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,258
It's okay, let's go in.

294
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,684
Yeong-mi.

295
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,939
Yeong-mi.

296
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,612
Do you know Lee Eun-pyo?

297
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,450
Are you insane? Why would you
upload that to a group chat?

298
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,205
Yeong-mi, I told you.
I did it out of worry, okay?

299
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,208
I couldn't talk to you about this,

300
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,210
so I've been trying to figure out a way
on my own and I just asked.

301
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,962
You said you slept with her.

302
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,882
-Maybe you took the photo and sent it.
-Yeong-mi, how could you…

303
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,052
I never asked her. She just sent it.

304
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,973
Yeong-mi, wait.

305
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,935
I know you're hurt because of me.

306
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,396
I'm really sorry, but…

307
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,815
Yeong-mi, I'm the victim here.

308
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,068
She called me every night
and invited me to her studio.

309
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,612
She came on to me first.

310
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,033
I don't know why
I did it either, Yeong-mi.

311
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,785
I don't even know why I did it.

312
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,205
But Yeong-mi, you know
how weak humans can be.

313
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,964
The production company called earlier.

314
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,137
They said Song Hae-seon accepted.

315
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,186
What do I do?

316
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,214
Hello.

317
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,676
Oh, hello.

318
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,893
Are you from Space Market?

319
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,978
-Yes, I am.
-I see.

320
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,231
Do you want to try them on?

321
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,691
No, it's okay.

322
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,071
-They're very clean.
-Yes.

323
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,947
-You're paying in cash, right?
-Yes.

324
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,619
I'm sure it's the correct amount.
Here you go.

325
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,579
Hope you wear it well.

326
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,581
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

327
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,302
Gosh.

328
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:06,059
Jeez. I'm just benefitting from her.

329
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:11,189
Well, what else can you do?
The living must go on.

330
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,852
What am I going to do with this?

331
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,231
It's not like I can sell it secondhand.

332
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,736
Can you even dismantle it?

333
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,825
Thank you for taking the time to see me.
I know you're busy.

334
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,829
I couldn't make up my mind
if I should tell you this.

335
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,333
I wondered if I should
just stay quiet about it,

336
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,837
but that just didn't seem right.

337
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,637
Jin-ha's photos

338
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,057
are all over the Internet.

339
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,729
I don't know how it happened,

340
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,441
but I thought something
should be done about it.

341
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,901
What sort of photos?

342
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,155
Tell me.

343
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,950
What sort of photos?

344
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,373
Nude photos.

345
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,707
What?

346
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,133
Where did you see them?

347
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,011
Do you have the photos right now?

348
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,346
No.

349
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,891
I only saw them on my students' phones.

350
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,894
And then I heard about it
from the chairman.

351
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,356
I think the word spread
in the art world first

352
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,693
because Jin-ha was a well-known artist.

353
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,300
What sort of photo?

354
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,054
Did she take them
or were they taken by someone else?

355
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,058
I don't know.

356
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,940
And why are you speaking up about this?

357
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,572
I know.

358
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,243
It might seem strange
from your perspective.

359
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:57,832
But I thought it'd be better for you to
hear it from me instead of someone else,

360
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:02,670
and I couldn't just let it spread.

361
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,340
I'm the one that's left behind, not you.

362
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,050
You're the one
who's trying to complicate things.

363
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,267
I know you must be taken aback,

364
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,187
but she's Henry's mom no matter what.

365
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,439
Shouldn't you stop people from
running their tongues about her?

366
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:25,818
No. It's none of my business
and I don't want to know about it.

367
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,904
If she made a mistake,

368
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,573
there's nothing to be done about it.

369
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,784
-Louis, how could you--
-How could you?

370
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,163
Stop.

371
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:43,461
Can't you see you're
rubbing salt in the wound?

372
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,723
Just…

373
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,019
don't do anything.

374
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,272
Don't go looking for anything.

375
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,652
Okay.

376
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,781
I spoke too rashly.

377
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,284
But this is how I see it.

378
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,412
Jin-ha wasn't just your wife.

379
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,791
She was a human being
and she deserves to be protected.

380
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,171
Think it over.

381
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,967
About which is more important.

382
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,830
Robot!

383
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:04,000
HENRY'S GRANDMOTHER

384
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,976
I'll take this apart again.

385
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,311
HENRY'S GRANDMOTHER

386
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,621
What is this about?

387
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,791
There's something I urgently
need to talk to you about.

388
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,844
Jeanne was nine months pregnant
when Modigliani passed away.

389
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,265
Was it because he asked her to be
his model even after he went to heaven?

390
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:05,186
The day after Modigliani died,
she jumped from the sixth floor

391
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,606
and followed her husband
into the afterlife.

392
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,654
That's a really inspirational story.

393
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,950
I knew storytelling would get
a strong reaction out of you.

394
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,161
I hope you write a story

395
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,624
that is as passionate
and beautiful as theirs.

396
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,133
What's this?

397
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,595
Can't you tell
after hearing her flirting like that?

398
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,725
It's proof that Henry's mother
stalked my husband.

399
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,564
You know that my husband
is an up-and-coming film director?

400
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,066
And that means…

401
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,361
there have been numerous women

402
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,364
that stalked him
by pretending to lure him.

403
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,409
I guess Henry's mother
was one of them too.

404
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,955
And she apparently sent that photo
to my husband without invitation.

405
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,707
Jul-pin's dad?

406
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,503
Jin-ha sent that photo to Jul-pin's dad?

407
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,047
Yes.

408
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,343
My husband was taken aback and sent it
to his friend to get his advice,

409
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,887
which I suppose started this.

410
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,766
So you're saying Jul-pin's father
is the original distributor?

411
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,352
Distributor? Watch what you're saying.

412
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,732
It's true, though. He's the one
who first sent it to his friend.

413
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,110
Don't you think that's wrong?

414
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,030
And how do I believe
that Jin-ha stalked him?

415
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:42,742
Am I just supposed to believe
what Jul-pin's father says?

416
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,077
That's why I played this for you.

417
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,456
You don't know everything
that went on in Henry's mother's mind.

418
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:54,378
To be honest,
you two weren't on very good terms.

419
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:01,010
Henry's mother was much more

420
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,348
devious than you think.

421
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:09,477
Did you really not know anything?

422
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,355
I don't care.

423
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,900
I don't want to listen to
this drivel anymore.

424
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:20,154
Just be sure to get rid of all the photos.

425
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:24,450
No matter the reason, he distributed it
so he needs to take responsibility.

426
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,868
Okay.

427
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:30,414
But to make it clear,

428
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,750
my husband is the victim here.

429
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,878
I admire your friendship

430
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:41,676
but remember that your actions
could hurt an innocent man.

431
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,636
Do you understand?

432
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,365
It must be hard looking after your kids.

433
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,992
I'm a mom myself,

434
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,995
but life as a mom…

435
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,831
is not that easy.

436
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,834
Be sure to…

437
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,714
give them plenty of love, no matter what.

438
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:23,843
Isn't that the best parents can do?

439
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,150
LEGAL COUNSELING

440
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,653
I've looked over
all the material you sent me.

441
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,781
But this case…

442
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,616
won't be easy.

443
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,078
The thing about gambling addicts is that

444
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,998
they think of their spouses
as some bottomless wallets,

445
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,584
so they do anything they can
to not get a divorce.

446
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,878
"I'll do it if you just
give me 20 million won."

447
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,671
"I'll do it if you just
pay this back for me."

448
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,381
That's how they stall.

449
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,178
So a divorce by agreement
is not quite an option.

450
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,305
You'd have to go through a trial.

451
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,101
So would you like to go through with it?

452
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,613
I'll be generous
and give you two million won.

453
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,990
As you know, not as many people
buy luxury brands these days

454
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,034
because of the bad economy.

455
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,955
Cash, right?

456
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,670
You can count it.
It should be the correct amount.

457
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,512
-Chun-hui.
-Hi.

458
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,055
I'm done, right?

459
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,436
Sometimes she lies without
even realizing she's doing it,

460
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,898
and she says "Mom, you said
you sometimes lie too, right?"

461
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,109
and looks at me.

462
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,569
It drives me crazy,

463
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,739
but I just say "Yes, right."

464
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,243
And try not to nag.
You know what I'm talking about, right?

465
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,411
I do.

466
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:20,334
The therapist says it's a good sign

467
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,253
and to help her feel more at ease.

468
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,256
It is. It means she now
trusts you completely.

469
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,845
I wonder when Dong-seok will get better.

470
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,222
I didn't think it would take this long.

471
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,266
Try to be patient.

472
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,061
Kids know immediately when you're not.

473
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:50,030
So what happened to that photo?

474
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,871
-Well…
-Hang on.

475
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,793
I have to take this call.

476
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,681
Yes. What is it?

477
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,726
Your husband called me.

478
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,855
He asked me to get fentanyl
and nalbuphine this time.

479
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:29,528
I said no, but there are a million places
he can get it from if he wants to.

480
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,281
I thought someone
should talk him out of it.

481
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,533
Chun-hui.

482
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,036
You know what I mean, right?

483
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,122
Okay. I'm hanging up.

484
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:47,129
SPORTS STANDINGS

485
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,471
YEONG-BIN'S MOTHER

486
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,270
What?

487
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,397
Did you ask the pharmaceutical company
to get you drugs?

488
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,317
-Where did you hear that?
-Are you crazy?

489
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,570
What if they suspend your license too?

490
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,656
Then why don't you get me the money?

491
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,617
I'm dying here and you're doing nothing.
So what else can I do?

492
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,535
Kim Ju-seok!

493
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,537
-Chun-hui.
-Yes.

494
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,248
Yu-bin's done. They asked you to come in.

495
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,541
Oh, really?

496
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,427
Chun-hui, are you feeling all right?

497
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,595
Yes, why?

498
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,557
You're so pale.

499
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,600
Am I?

500
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,353
Maybe I had something bad for breakfast.

501
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,482
Ma'am, you got a text.

502
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,650
I did?

503
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,291
Eun-pyo, did you see this photo?
Do you know what it's about?

504
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,711
A mom in the neighborhood sent me this.

505
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,380
She says she doesn't know
who first sent it.

506
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,215
What on earth is going on?

507
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,930
It could've been
a hidden camera or an affair.

508
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:24,476
Or maybe she was having fun with her
husband and someone hacked her phone.

509
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,811
I don't think so.

510
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,814
Her husband's too respectable,
he'd never do something like that.

511
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,025
It's an affair, I'm sure of it.

512
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,905
So she killed herself after the affair.

513
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,325
Is that the conjecture?

514
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:44,788
I wonder who it is.
He had his fun and leaked the photos.

515
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,666
It must be revenge, right?

516
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,836
They were seeing each other happily,
then Henry's mom ended things,

517
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,254
so he did that.

518
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,339
Goodness.

519
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,800
-Yes, that could be it.
-Right.

520
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,929
The culprit must be nearby.

521
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,681
Nearby.

522
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:15,611
What's going on?
You said you'd take care of it.

523
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:19,198
Are you trying to add fuel to the fire?

524
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,742
We're the ones
who got stabbed in the back.

525
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,912
This is all that crazy woman's fault
and this is a very important time for us.

526
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:25,871
What?

527
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:29,625
Anyway, you need to keep this
a secret no matter what.

528
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:34,546
If you go around saying false things,
you'll have to deal with me.

529
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,261
I can't believe this woman!

530
00:44:56,652 --> 00:45:00,364
Broccoli, I saw the article about
the casting for your husband's movie!

531
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,537
EXCLUSIVE: SONG HAE-SEON
TO STAR IN DIRECTOR OH'S NEW MOVIE

532
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,789
DIRECTOR OH GEON-U'S NEW MOVIE
HAS BEEN UNVEILED

533
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:13,127
LIKE I WAS NEVER HERE AT ALL
HAS STARTED PRODUCTION

534
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,549
No one knows who leaked it.

535
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,970
It's a complete mystery
and the photos are just going around.

536
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,013
Oh, Eun-pyo.

537
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,267
She's not a stranger.
Shouldn't we do something?

538
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,439
Should we report it to the police?

539
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,732
No?

540
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,695
What if we tell the family…

541
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,281
Right, no.

542
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,491
I mean,

543
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,121
if she really did have an affair,
her husband would probably hate her.

544
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,415
Jeez, what do we do?

545
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,543
What should we do?

546
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,925
HENRY'S GRANDMOTHER

547
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:03,802
Answer it.

548
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,475
Hello?

549
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,519
It's been a while, Dong-seok's mom.

550
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,605
Yes.

551
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,273
How have you been?

552
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,484
I called because this time,

553
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:22,321
Henry won't stop pestering
me to invite Dong-seok.

554
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:25,574
Does Dong-seok miss Henry too?

555
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,495
Of course, he does.

556
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,081
Then bring him by sometime soon.

557
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,209
Okay.

558
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,546
By the way, ma'am…

559
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,050
Are you going to tell her?

560
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,643
Thank you for your call.

561
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,270
I'm the grateful one.

562
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,606
Give me a call about the date.

563
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,359
Okay.

564
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,652
Bye.

565
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,531
Gosh.

566
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,991
She doesn't know at all?

567
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,160
No.

568
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,578
Goodness.

569
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,499
Seriously, what do we do?

570
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,644
Kids, this song is called the "Winter."

571
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:39,856
But I'm not getting any coldness.
Try playing it a little colder.

572
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,651
She's dead but there's
no end to embarrassment.

573
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,862
I know. It's an embarrassment
to the whole neighborhood.

574
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,533
Your little one was
in the same class with her son.

575
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,077
Did you notice anything weird?

576
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,039
Not really, we weren't very close.

577
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,083
Right.

578
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,918
I don't like talking about
other people's business,

579
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,587
but this doesn't feel like it is.

580
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,797
It isn't. It affects the kids.

581
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:08,719
If she thought it was shameful,
then she shouldn't have done it.

582
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,138
Did you ask my husband for the drugs?

583
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,432
It's because you keep ignoring me.

584
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:16,768
What scares me the most
is that the kids might hear about it.

585
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,812
That's what scares me the most too.

586
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,939
What are we going to do about this?

587
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,816
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

588
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,113
Now that we've got Song Hae-seon,

589
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,449
it's going to get some attention
from abroad too.

590
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:35,287
As to its quality, we've got Director Oh,
so there is nothing to worry about.

591
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,997
-Stop it.
-While we're at it,

592
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,207
let's aim for the Cannes Festival.

593
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,168
-Goodbye, Director.
-Bye. Good work today.

594
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,252
-Bye!
-Bye!

595
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,671
-Let's make something great!
-Yes, we got this!

596
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,635
Bye!

597
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,117
So…

598
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,330
you went around saying
you slept with my wife,

599
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,916
but you didn't actually do it?

600
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,793
Well, yes.

601
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,253
I'm sure you know…

602
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:31,551
about how men bluff when they boast
and how childish it can be.

603
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,181
When Ms. Seo sent me that photo,

604
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,934
I sort of took it as a joke and…

605
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:46,024
I must've not been thinking
straight at the time. I'm sorry.

606
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:47,859
And…

607
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,364
My wife stalked you?

608
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,160
Yes, like I've told you.

609
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,960
Then why didn't you mention the photo
during the police investigation?

610
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,799
Right, well…

611
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:16,888
It was an encrypted message…

612
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,158
Fine.

613
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,827
I'll take your word for it.

614
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:46,042
But I don't want this issue
taken to the police.

615
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:51,047
I don't want my wife's personal life
to be disclosed any further.

616
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,845
Please handle this as soon as possible.

617
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,140
If you don't,

618
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:04,561
you'll also suffer consequences.

619
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:06,938
Okay.

620
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,884
-Geon-u…
-Don't talk to me.

621
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,763
Damn it!

622
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,002
A CLUB FOR ENLIGHTENED SANGWE MOMS

623
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,756
CHEERS FOR SANGKEMO AND
PROTECTORS OF THE ENVIRONMENT!

624
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,898
Leave my husband alone.

625
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,736
Leave him alone already!
Stop bothering us!

626
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:41,241
I told you to stop.
I said I'm not going to do it anymore!

627
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,288
Why are you doing this?

628
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:49,499
Do you want to see my family ruined?

629
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,089
ORCHESTRA PERFORMANCE
WITH SANGWE ELEMENTARY

630
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,299
Let's go in.

631
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,592
Hello.

632
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,135
-Oh, you're here early.
-Ji-hu.

633
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,303
Have some of this.

634
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,597
-Ju-hyeok, have you been practicing?
-Ji-hye, are things going well?

635
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,765
You must be hungry.

636
00:53:56,858 --> 00:54:00,236
-Kids, you must be hungry.
-Here. Have some coffee too.

637
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,906
Are you nervous?

638
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,074
-I'm okay.
-You are?

639
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,784
Just a minute.

640
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,787
You must be hungry.

641
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:09,871
ORCHESTRA PERFORMANCE
WITH SANGWE ELEMENTARY

642
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,665
This is so annoying.

643
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:15,126
Why do they make the younger kids come
when it's the older kids performing?

644
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,254
I don't even like it when adults play.

645
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,757
Why do I have to listen to kids?

646
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,593
Jeez.

647
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,472
I can't thank you all enough
for lending me an ear last time.

648
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,349
It really warmed my heart.

649
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,684
-Guys.
-Yes?

650
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,769
-Go get stamps.
-Okay.

651
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,354
Hi.

652
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,355
Bye.

653
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,150
Thank you.

654
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:40,902
Right?

655
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,613
I'm worried that they're nervous.

656
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:50,912
It's Byeon Chun-hui.

657
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,373
Right.

658
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,166
Her son is also playing today, right?

659
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,045
SANGWE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ORCHESTRA

660
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,715
Who cares about the performance?

661
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:02,716
VIOLIN SOLO: KIM YEONG-BIN

662
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,342
He's playing the solo piece today?

663
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,302
He must be really good.

664
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,182
Eun-pyo. What's she like
when you cross paths with her?

665
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,184
Does she give you the cold shoulder too?

666
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,478
I don't know.

667
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,647
We don't really see each other.

668
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,233
Mom, I got the stamp.

669
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,277
Good job.

670
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,737
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

671
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,113
Let's go in.

672
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,257
There's a seat.

673
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,592
Guys, come on.

674
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,510
-Follow me.
-Hello.

675
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,345
-Hello.
-Hello.

676
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,473
-You're here.
-Hello.

677
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:54,392
-Hello.
-Hello.

678
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,229
Dong-seok's mom, long time no see.

679
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,398
-How've you been?
-Good. How've you been?

680
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:05,403
Your skin is glowing.
She must be aging backward.

681
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,655
Oh, come on.

682
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,532
It must be a product she uses.

683
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,414
You've heard about the thing, right?

684
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,374
About what?

685
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:24,964
Jul-pin's dad is a famous director.

686
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,758
Right?

687
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,384
The photo…

688
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,137
The photo.

689
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,808
Henry's mother sent it
to seduce Jul-pin's dad.

690
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,476
She was a stalker.

691
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,769
Goodness.

692
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,395
Where did you hear that?

693
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,523
-That scared me.
-You're here.

694
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,570
Jul-pin's mom was crying at Enigma

695
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,615
about how her family is in trouble
because of that crazy woman.

696
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:51,950
It's okay.

697
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,536
I'm really okay.

698
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,954
It's just…

699
00:56:56,037 --> 00:57:00,500
I've worked so hard for so long
to eradicate discrimination against women.

700
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,294
But now that something
like this has happened…

701
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,421
I can't believe it.

702
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,677
It's heartbreaking that his name
is being slandered like this.

703
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,388
-Especially at such an important moment.
-Oh, no.

704
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:17,142
I can't believe something
like this is happening to me.

705
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,727
I just can't believe all this.

706
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:22,605
Goodness. You must feel terrible.

707
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,650
I thought it was just
something people talked about.

708
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,319
I never thought I'd be the victim…

709
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:32,824
So she's saying Henry's mother took
the photo and sent it herself, right?

710
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,702
I guess so.

711
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,413
But why would she?

712
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,208
To seduce him.

713
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,630
It doesn't make sense.
Why would she take and send it herself?

714
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,841
Yun-ju, keep an eye
on Dong-seok for a minute.

715
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,926
Eun-pyo, where are you going?

716
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,345
-No, not yet.
-Oh, please.

717
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,055
As a leader of Sangwe Moms…

718
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,183
All right. Enjoy the show.

719
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,350
-Bye.
-See you later.

720
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,435
-Bye.
-Bye.

721
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,188
We need to talk.

722
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,108
About what?

723
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,568
Are you kidding me?

724
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,446
You told me not to tell anyone
and even threatened me.

725
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,740
Why are you going around telling people?

726
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,996
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

727
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,373
What are you trying to do to the deceased?

728
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:43,019
The performance is about to start.

729
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:47,106
May everyone in the hall please be seated.

730
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,027
Let's talk outside.

731
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,180
What's going on?

732
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,723
Are they fighting?

733
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,434
About what? What grade moms?

734
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,646
That pill in Sangkemo
and a first grader's mom.

735
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,772
What happened?

736
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,149
It must be about that rumor.

737
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,943
Do you think it'll get physical?

738
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,112
I'd rather see them than the performance.

739
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:44,664
It's cowardly.

740
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:49,085
It's cowardly to do this to the deceased
who can't speak up just to save your neck.

741
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,132
I never put any stock
in that recording anyway.

742
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:58,052
I stayed quiet because I didn't think
you'd go this far as a mother.

743
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,805
But you're crossing the line!

744
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,390
It's despicable!

745
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,445
There's your brother.

746
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:02,677
Who is it?

747
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,644
Yes.

748
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,646
How admirable of you.

749
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:18,568
Resolutely standing up
for your dead friend.

750
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,194
How touching.

751
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:25,158
Actually, I've felt this
since a while back.

752
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,328
You're quite a hypocrite yourself.

753
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:31,914
In fact,

754
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,626
there's this one thing I didn't tell you.

755
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,004
And I wonder

756
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:42,759
if your hypocrisy
will last when you hear it.

757
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,594
Be honest.

758
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,971
Weren't you angry

759
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,806
that she took your boyfriend?

760
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:54,312
The thing is, Henry's mother said

761
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:57,982
she took him from you on purpose.

762
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,863
I took him from her on purpose.

763
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,991
I knew they were dating.

764
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:10,953
I watched them for a long time in secret.

765
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:14,999
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

766
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:17,710
And then I decided on the D-Day.

767
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,963
I wanted to crush Eun-pyo
into a miserable pulp

768
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,674
when she was at the height of her glory.

769
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,428
Eun-pyo.

770
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,517
Eun-pyo.

771
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,312
It didn't matter who the guy was.

772
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,272
What mattered…

773
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:42,819
was showing Eun-pyo
that what she thought of as hers

774
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:46,823
might not actually be hers.

775
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:47,740
You're lying!

776
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,160
You're lying.

777
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,745
It can't be.

778
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,748
Jin-ha wouldn't have done that to me.

779
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,834
She wouldn't have!

780
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,889
I'm not going to live with you anymore,
so just sign the paper.

781
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:36,766
Do whatever you want.
I'm going to reveal everything you did.

782
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,810
Go ahead and reveal everything!
You better let it all out, okay?

783
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:42,188
They're selling all kinds of stuff
through various supply routes.

784
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,107
-Why would he do something like this?
-I'm getting a divorce.

785
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,734
Then will you run away with me?

786
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:47,777
Ms. Lee Eun-pyo?

787
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:51,197
To be honest, Ms. Seo and I
were in love with each other.

788
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,240
I worked so hard to protect my pride.

789
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,993
How can you take
everything down in one fell swoop?

790
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:58,287
Henry's mom?

791
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,373
Why would you do something
that I didn't ask you to do?

792
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:03,084
Why do you have to
keep making things worse?

793
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,961
If I don't do anything, what will you do?

794
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,504
Her husband wanted to cover it up.

795
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:10,758
He didn't want his wife's private life
to go public, so he said to cover it up.

796
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:18,933
