1
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,280
Henry's mom said…

2
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,492
her husband was having an affair

3
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,495
so she wanted to kill herself.

4
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,206
And she said

5
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,250
something about the mistress
being a university friend.

6
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:31,049
She mentioned that she recently
ran into her in the neighborhood.

7
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,597
Would something like this
be helpful for the investigation?

8
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,240
It's been a while, Dong-seok's mom.

9
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,078
Your husband is such a gentleman.

10
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,830
He brought home a cake to celebrate

11
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,665
getting into
the school for gifted students.

12
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,333
Enjoy your party today.

13
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,184
Aren't you going to get off?

14
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,273
What is it?

15
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,733
It's nothing.

16
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,963
-Congratulations on getting in!
-Congratulations on getting in!

17
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,341
-Congratulations on getting in!
-Congratulations on getting in!

18
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,053
-Congratulations dear Dong-seok
-Congratulations dear Dong-seok

19
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,431
-Congratulations on getting in!
-Congratulations on getting in!

20
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,765
Blow the candles out, Dong-seok.

21
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,185
Congratulations, Dong-seok.

22
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,522
Now let's eat your favorite.
Have some chicken.

23
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,067
You too, Dong-ju.

24
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,531
Dong-sik.

25
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,825
Forensics sent over the analyses
from the Sangwe incident.

26
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,912
-Is there anything out of the ordinary?
-Not really.

27
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,122
It's just a tragedy.

28
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,458
She did commit suicide
because of depression.

29
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,667
Right?

30
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,213
All the texts were in French.

31
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,008
I almost died trying to get
the whole thing translated.

32
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,553
What did they talk about?

33
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,223
Damn it.

34
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,682
Take a look for yourself.

35
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,397
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?
EUN-PYO WON'T STOP MESSING WITH ME.

36
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,733
I THINK I'M GOING TO DIE!
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING EUN-PYO?

37
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,820
There's also a text from the mistress.

38
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,157
YOUR HUSBAND AND I HAVE NOTHING GOING ON

39
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,284
It seems pretty clear
that they were friends.

40
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,204
I can see why she wanted to kill herself.

41
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:10,500
She got stabbed in the back
by someone close to her just like me.

42
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,921
It's only a pity for the dead.

43
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:42,240
CHUN-HUI…

44
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,203
Hello.

45
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,175
By the way…

46
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,137
why did you bring such a big bag…

47
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,311
when you were visiting
the next building that day?

48
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,900
Oh…

49
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,736
The bag was full of books.

50
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,074
She wanted some recommendations
on books for preparing for

51
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,700
the school for gifted students.

52
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,414
The person who wanted
to kill herself said that?

53
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,042
I know, right?

54
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,796
It's ironic, isn't it?

55
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,609
This is driving me crazy.

56
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,692
SANGWE MOMS ONLINE COMMUNITY

DID YOU KNOW SOMEONE FROM THE PENTHOUSE
IN BUILDING 901 JUMPED OFF THE BUILDING?

58
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,621
I HEARD. WHAT’S GOING ON?

59
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,248

THE SCARLET LETTER

61
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,250
-That's her, right?
-Is it?

62
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,629
-It could be her.
-Yes.

63
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,519
MOLE'S SUNRISE

64
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,070
Excuse me.

65
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,031
Why do you keep staring at me like that?

66
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,324
Me?

67
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,660
When did I do that?

68
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,037
Let's go.

69
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,500
She's not even that pretty.

70
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,293
-I know.
-She has no shame.

71
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,848
Hey, what's going on?

72
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,976
Su-in's mom, I heard
Henry's mom died after her husband

73
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,978
and a university friend had an affair.

74
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,063
Isn't she your cousin?

75
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,898
I heard she always looked out for her,

76
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,818
but couldn't handle it
when she got stabbed in the back.

77
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,528
She has no shame.

78
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,655
She's a trash human being.

79
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,576
I heard she told everyone
that she's a professor when she's not.

80
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,578
She lied about being a professor?

81
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,373
They've been going crazy
in the mom's chatroom all morning, so I--

82
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,084
Where did these women hear all this from?

83
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,380
No one gave me a straight answer.
They just said they heard it from someone.

84
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,383
Did you tell them about me getting fired?

85
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,551
Eun-pyo…

86
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,596
It wasn't me.
I never told anyone about that.

87
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,391
To tell you the truth,

88
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,810
I'm not a professor.

89
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,605
You didn't know that, did you?

90
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,525
I actually got fired!

91
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,450
It's not true, is it?
You weren't actually having an affair--

92
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,618
Are you seriously asking me that?

93
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,372
Where are you going?

94
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,585
Why is she yelling?

95
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,295
Is she guilty or what?

96
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,592
-It was you, wasn't it?
-What was me?

97
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,887
You're the one telling everyone
that Jin-ha died because of me, right?

98
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,057
What are you even talking about?

99
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,435
You're the only one
who knows that I got fired.

100
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,062
So?

101
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,939
What about it?

102
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,652
All you're worried about
is saving your own face

103
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,112
but not the damage you inflict on others.

104
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,576
Stop living your life like that.

105
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,205
What are you so proud of
when you seduced another woman's husband

106
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,331
and made her kill herself?

107
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,876
-What?
-Stop muddying the waters

108
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,837
and get out of the neighborhood.

109
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,677
Open the door! I'm not done talking!

110
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,057
How could you do this to me?

111
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,815
DONG-SEOK'S MOM

112
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,866
The number you have dialed
is not available…

113
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,666
How could you make me
a mistress overnight?

114
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,709
What did I ever do to you?

115
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,045
Something happened
between you and Jin-ha, right?

116
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,881
There's no other reason
why you'd be doing this to me.

117
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,260
Or is it because Dong-seok
got accepted but Yu-bin didn't?

118
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,651
Did you have lunch yet?

119
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,363
You should still eat.

120
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,658
I thought you already left to eat,
so I went to eat alone. Jeez.

121
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,872
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

122
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,958
I think you can close up the Sangwe case.

123
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,377
-Why?
-Forensics came in yesterday

124
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,547
and I think her husband
was having an affair with her friend.

125
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,176
-The deceased must've heard it and--
-Come over here for a second.

126
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,887
-Hyeok-ho.
-Yes?

127
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,724
Print off the report for me.

128
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,595
Do you know…

129
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,350
Ms. Lee Eun-pyo?

130
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,524
What is your relationship with her?

131
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,946
She's my ex-girlfriend.
I dated her briefly in France.

132
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,743
-Do you still meet her?
-No.

133
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:53,249
But my wife was
very suspicious that I was.

134
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,797
Then what's this?

135
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,057
I THINK I'M GOING TO DIE!
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING EUN-PYO?

136
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,184
YOU SLEPT WITH HER, DIDN'T YOU?
SHE ADMITTED IT

137
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,944
They were friends.

138
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,532
My wife started to worry
because we started working together.

139
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,829
Are you saying she was making assumptions
when there was nothing going on?

140
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,792
There was one time when she saw us

141
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,670
together at our house.

142
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,257
Just the two of you?

143
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:49,263
She overheard Eun-pyo asking me

144
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,100
why I had left her.

145
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,354
That's when she started to get obsessed.

146
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,652
Why would she ask you that?

147
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,615
Are you saying
she still has feelings for you?

148
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,533
I wouldn't know.

149
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,416
Why would you be curious about that?

150
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,087
You're right that I'm curious.

151
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,382
How can a person meet two friends
and weigh them against each other?

152
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,495
What's going on?

153
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,958
Why did you…

154
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,044
lie to me?

155
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,466
Lie about what?

156
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,468
I heard you used to go out
with the husband

157
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,014
of the woman who died.

158
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:05,232
How did you know about that?

159
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,988
I don't think…

160
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,243
that the two of you started
seeing each other again.

161
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,996
But you still lied to me.

162
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,004
You lied that you weren't close with her,

163
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,759
and you lied about
working with her husband.

164
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,636
You didn't tell me anything about that.

165
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,853
If there was nothing to feel guilty about,
you would've told me.

166
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,189
No.

167
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,233
It's not like that.

168
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,527
Then why would you want to know

169
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,655
why that guy left you?

170
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,498
Jae-ung.

171
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:31,401
I still owe you from last time,
so that's why I wanted to meet up today.

172
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,862
You don't owe me anything.

173
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,990
Congratulations, by the way.

174
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,868
Your daughter got accepted to
the school for gifted students, right?

175
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,245
Yes.

176
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,165
I guess she just got lucky.

177
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,668
As if there's anything such as luck.

178
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,505
My daughter was crying and all
because she didn't make it.

179
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,925
In that case,

180
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:58,011
perhaps it's your turn
to treat us to drinks tonight.

181
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,141
Well…

182
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,686
I'm only joking.

183
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,023
-It's on me. Don't worry.
-All right.

184
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,365
The etomidate I mentioned last time…

185
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,075
Is it ready, by any chance?

186
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,167
I'm sure you already know,
but anesthetics are heavily regulated.

187
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,670
If anything slips up, then we'd have
to report every single move we make.

188
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,839
It can turn into a huge headache.

189
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,843
They haven't been classified
as psychotropics yet,

190
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,429
so it'd be great if I could stock up
on them before things change.

191
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,563
Well, sir.

192
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,275
As you know,

193
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,238
I already have a record of being kicked
out of the industry for a similar case.

194
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,701
But as it turns out,
this is how I make my living,

195
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:06,288
so I somehow managed to return
to the pharmaceutical industry.

196
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,459
But if I were to get caught
for the same thing again…

197
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,254
I'm worried that
I might never be able to work again.

198
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,507
I'm grateful that you've always

199
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,594
watched out for me financially
and emotionally all these years but…

200
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,264
I'm sorry.

201
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,732
Goodness, what are you saying?

202
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,360
Mr. Lee, you've completely
misunderstood me.

203
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,822
I wasn't talking about making
any sort of illegal connection.

204
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,783
All I wanted to know

205
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,953
was how much product I could buy
through fully legal means.

206
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,539
My gosh, you're talking about
something very sketchy.

207
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,876
-Have a drink.
-Yes, sir.

208
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,462
Here.

209
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,215
All right.

210
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,972
-Drink up.
-Yes, sir.

211
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,522
Come out. I'm in the parking lot.

212
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,528
You come out!

213
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,166
Fine.

214
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,086
I hear you loud and clear.

215
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,507
I'll contact you
once things quiet down a bit.

216
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,304
What?

217
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,806
You're going to leave just like that?

218
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,101
I have credit card fees I need to pay off.

219
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,436
Please!

220
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,939
Think before you act.

221
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,318
Don't you know that we'll get
in deep trouble if we continue right now?

222
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,652
I don't.

223
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,612
I don't know that, actually.

224
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,074
I'm just going to call Detective Kang.

225
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,286
Let's see.

226
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,246
I think his number was…

227
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,373
Hey!

228
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,714
Why are you shaking? Come here.

229
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,646
Jeez.

230
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,978
This is very shocking for you too, right?

231
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,566
She didn't know anything
about this either.

232
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,901
What is this?

233
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,946
If this isn't a gross negligence
murder case, then what is?

234
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,242
That's taking it a bit too far, isn't it?

235
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,786
How can we believe all the rumors
in the online community?

236
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,831
-Someone could be setting her up.
-It's all true.

237
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,340
Actually, I met Henry's mom that night.

238
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,014
-Dong-ju.
-Dong-ju.

239
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,808
-Bye.
-Bye.

240
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,809
Mom.

241
00:23:55,892 --> 00:24:00,689
-I had so much fun with my friends today.
-Mom!

242
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,233
-You did?
-And we all got along well.

243
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:09,197
How can she be so brazen
when someone died because of her?

244
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,700
-She's so unconcerned.
-I wouldn't be able to do that.

245
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,456
Mom, I want strawberry cake.

246
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,374
What?

247
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:25,463
We have bread and strawberry jam
at home so let's eat that, okay?

248
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:29,384
No, I want strawberry cake.

249
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,429
Mom, I want strawberry cake too.

250
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,890
Hello.

251
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,641
-Welcome.
-Hello.

252
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,395
Here's the strawberry cake.

253
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,981
Here we go.

254
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,111
Close the door, please.

255
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,576
Can you ring these up, please?

256
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,536
And this one.

257
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,832
Let me help you out.

258
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,250
Yes.

259
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,544
Ma'am, we were here first.

260
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,922
I'm sorry, but you'll have to
go to another bakery.

261
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,798
We're not selling anything to you.

262
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,802
What do you mean?
Why wouldn't you sell to us?

263
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,306
Miss.

264
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,311
You know Henry's mother, right?

265
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,899
She was a regular here.

266
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,359
I heard the whole story.

267
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,654
I heard you had an affair…

268
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,244
with Henry's mom's husband.

269
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,707
Even if we can't be
the most decent human beings,

270
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,501
we shouldn't become monsters.

271
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:48,755
How can you be so shameless
when you claimed the life of your friend?

272
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,590
Look here, ma'am.

273
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,344
I don't know what kind of stories
you heard to treat me so rudely--

274
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,887
There were rumors going around

275
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,182
about how she asked people to help
stop you until the very last moment.

276
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,977
Are you still going to
stand there and act clueless?

277
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,527
Let's go.

278
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:44,185
The number you have dialed
is not available…

279
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,421
Dong-ju, Dong-seok, it's dangerous.
Come down from there.

280
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,888
Chun-hui! We need to talk.

281
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,766
Dong-ju, Dong-seok, come on. Hurry.

282
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,268
-Mom, I'm spilling all my chips!
-Hurry up!

283
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,437
-Mom!
-Chun-hui!

284
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,523
Mom, I'm spilling all my chips!

285
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,025
-Chun-hui!
-Mom!

286
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,610
-I just want to talk!
-Mom!

287
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,820
-Mom, where are we going?
-Mom!

288
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,947
-Hurry up.
-Mom, my chips!

289
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,949
-Just hurry up.
-Mom.

290
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,011
Chun-hui, wait up!

291
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,263
-Mom.
-Mom, where are we going?

292
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,184
Chun-hui, wait.

293
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,356
Please enter the passcode again.

294
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,319
Chun-hui!

295
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,071
Chun-hui!

296
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,741
My chips…

297
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,454
My chips…

298
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,541
My chips…

299
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,710
My chips…

300
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,689
INCOMING CALL

301
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,779
I told you to stop.

302
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,074
Stop calling me!

303
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,430
Hello, Ms. Hwang.

304
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,601
You must be getting off work,
but I have something to ask you.

305
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,729
Between the crossing guard,
Green, and lunch service,

306
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:36,191
do you know which days
Yu-bin's mother volunteers on?

307
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,150
SANITARY CLOTHES

308
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,909
Has she gone completely mad?

309
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:46,993
I know.

310
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,264
Thank you for all your work.

311
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,310
These ventilation hoods and…

312
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,645
Please come this way.

313
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,982
The cooking equipment used to be so old

314
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:22,070
that this whole kitchen
used to heat up to almost 40 degrees.

315
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,406
Gosh, it was very inconvenient
for the cooks.

316
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,242
But now we provide…

317
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,118
Why are you doing this to me?

318
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,453
What did I do?

319
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,915
Even if you've been put into a corner,
you shouldn't cross certain lines.

320
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,417
Does it feel nice
to suddenly turn me into a mistress?

321
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,711
Why are you doing this on purpose?

322
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,548
On purpose?

323
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,508
You're obviously guilty about something,

324
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,844
which is why you're cornering me.

325
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,683
Please stop trying to make this look like
it's someone else's fault.

326
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,686
You're the one who's been
crossing lines you shouldn't have.

327
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,189
Hello.

328
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,566
-Hello.
-Hello.

329
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,150
Ma'am.

330
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,571
You can't take off your mask
during lunch service.

331
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,197
Would you mind putting it back on?

332
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,282
Yes.

333
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,216
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

334
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,846
This cafeteria was built
just three months ago.

335
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,974
And actually,
before we had this cafeteria,

336
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,644
we would go into fifth period
without properly cleaning up the place.

337
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,148
Tell me, then.
What was the last thing Jin-ha told you?

338
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,026
You said you talked about
something that cheered her up.

339
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,949
But she still ended up jumping.

340
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,536
Stop with your babbling. We're at school.

341
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,458
That letter was from Jin-ha, wasn't it?

342
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:03,087
Jin-ha told me that you were
someone I needed to be careful of.

343
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,383
Something happened
between you and her, right?

344
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,890
Ladies, please keep your voices down.

345
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,485
Let's talk after this.
Don't even think about running away.

346
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,990
You think I'm afraid of you?

347
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,078
-Where do you think you're going?
-Let go!

348
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,580
-Stop right there!
-Let go!

349
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,588
Excuse me.

350
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,529
-Are you okay?
-Don't touch me!

351
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,270
Oh, no!

352
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,570
Mom, read me a book.

353
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,490
MOLE'S SUNRISE

354
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,535
"They held hands and walked on their way."

355
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,080
'Are we going far?'

356
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,749
Mole asked."

357
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,628
'We just need to go to the lake.'

358
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,422
'That's where we'll have the best view.'

359
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,344
'Don't trip on the roots, Mole,'

360
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,347
said Vole."

361
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,687
'Wow, the sun is rising.'

362
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,482
'I can see the tip.'

363
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,904
'It looks like
the soft yolk of a fried egg,'

364
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,366
said Vole."

365
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,538
"'It must look like
the eggs I eat for breakfast,'

366
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,416
thought Mole."

367
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,339
Mole,

368
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,802
despite not being able to see,

369
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,557
was able to enjoy the sunrise."

370
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,146
"Although he couldn't
see it with his eyes,

371
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,485
he could see it with his heart."

372
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,087
The sunrise that Mole saw

373
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,758
was even more beautiful

374
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:24,640
than anyone could ever imagine."

375
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,635
Weren't you and Yu-bin's mother…

376
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,972
best friends?

377
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:12,730
And you were also close
with Henry's late mother, weren't you?

378
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,358
From what I could see
during the open class day,

379
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,526
the two of you seemed rather close.

380
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,322
I wouldn't say we were close…

381
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,078
But I guess so.

382
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,412
Usually,

383
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,875
the death of an acquaintance can have…

384
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,464
an exhausting effect.

385
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,938
Weren't you close with Dong-seok's mother?

386
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:58,651
That was until I knew
the truth of the matter.

387
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,737
You know well
about what happened to Henry's mom…

388
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,952
Never mind.

389
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:11,247
I have no intentions
of getting involved with her anymore.

390
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,261
Come in.

391
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,098
-Are you eating?
-Yes.

392
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,349
I was wondering

393
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,812
if we can do group therapy for parents.

394
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,149
-For parents?
-Yes.

395
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,901
Sure.

396
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,705
Okay, so the purpose of today's program,

397
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:56,667
is to try and heal from the wounds
caused by the death of an acquaintance.

398
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,838
We're here to help
each other grieve in earnest.

399
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,968
I'm sure a session like this
is unfamiliar to all of you,

400
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,929
but I think it'll be helpful
if you open your hearts

401
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,432
and work together.

402
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,352
Don't be nervous.

403
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,989
Relax your body.

404
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,789
Let's focus all our energy on our hearts.

405
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,543
All right, let's all close our eyes.

406
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,300
Focus on the center of your heart.

407
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,596
Try and imagine

408
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,725
that you've taken out your heart
and placed it in your hand.

409
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,451
-Gosh, Eun-pyo!
-Goodness!

410
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,953
-Somebody call 911!
-Goodness!

411
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,955
-Somebody call 911!
-Ma'am.

412
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,123
Are you okay?

413
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,043
Call 911! My goodness.

414
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,174
Slowly.

415
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,073
Damn it.

416
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,578
Seriously?

417
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,005
You little…

418
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,506
Open the door.

419
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,507
Hey.

420
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,552
Didn't I tell you not to touch my things?

421
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,928
Open the door.

422
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,389
Damn it. Do you want to die?

423
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,391
You…

424
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,519
Open the door, Jul-pin.

425
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,481
Jul-pin?

426
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:25,941
Jul-pin.

427
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,194
Jul-pin, you little…

428
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,322
How many times have I told you
not to test my patience?

429
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,492
Why the hell won't you listen
when I ask you nicely?

430
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,757
Are you feeling better now?

431
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:40,683
Can I ask you what kind of emotions
caused you so much distress?

432
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,646
Henry's mother…

433
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,776
was a friend of mine since middle school.

434
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,571
We even went to university together.

435
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,865
We shared a lot of memories

436
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,493
and had been through a lot together.

437
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,330
The sadness that I feel

438
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,917
-is incomparable--
-Guilt.

439
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,339
It's more guilt than sadness

440
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,217
that you're having
a hard time dealing with.

441
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,557
Yes.

442
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,517
Indeed.

443
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,313
I feel guilty
that I wasn't there to protect her.

444
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,315
I do.

445
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,275
But…

446
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,112
aren't you also having a hard time,
Yu-bin's mother?

447
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,073
I heard that the last person
that sees someone

448
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:41,201
before they commit suicide
also feels a tremendous amount of guilt.

449
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,581
They ask themselves questions like
"Why couldn't I stop them from doing it?"

450
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,915
And feel a sense of shame.

451
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,797
Hey, Dong-seok.

452
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,008
Did you do all the 1062 homework?

453
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,010
-Yes.
-Up until where?

454
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,845
-Until the end.
-Really?

455
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,139
Dong-seok, you must really be a genius.

456
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:05,017
It took me almost three hours
to solve one page.

457
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,187
-What about you, Su-in?
-I did five pages.

458
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,231
Jeez, you did a whole bunch.

459
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,609
What if they split up the class?

460
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:14,943
What about Yu-bin?

461
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,571
She'll obviously be in our class.

462
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,406
She didn't even make it into
the school for gifted students.

463
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,867
She always thought
she was better than everyone.

464
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,577
It sucks that we didn't get in,

465
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,954
but isn't it kind of sweet
that she didn't make it?

466
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,456
You're right.

467
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,729
SCIENCE 1062
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

468
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,609
To be honest,

469
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,945
it's still very strange for me.

470
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:02,533
Why would the two of you meet up
at that hour when you weren't even close?

471
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:07,663
And why didn't Jin-ha overcome
her hopelessness even after that?

472
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,542
Are you sure you really just
had a quiet talk together?

473
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,127
All right.

474
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,295
Would it be okay

475
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,884
if I explained the whole story here?

476
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,474
Ma'am.

477
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,312
May I say something?

478
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,941
Yes, go ahead.

479
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:40,028
First of all, in my opinion,

480
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,073
the most important thing
we can gain from this incident

481
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,785
is a chance to think about what kind of
soul-seeking and self-reflection

482
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,788
would be best for us.

483
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,791
As I'm sure you're all aware,

484
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:56,295
our neighborhood is overcome with
a feverish drive for education.

485
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:59,631
It was in this type
of polluted environment

486
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,092
that Ms. Seo stood
for a more progressive approach

487
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,137
-to education before she--
-Cut the crap, Jul-pin's mother.

488
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,518
We're not here

489
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,856
to listen to your admonitions.

490
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:26,950
But I can't help but feel
that Yu-bin's mom is lying.

491
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,290
You remember that night, right?

492
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,877
You and I met in the elevator.

493
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,005
You.

494
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,841
Why won't you come down?

495
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:47,054
Come down.

496
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,722
Darn it.

497
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,271
Let go of me!

498
00:46:56,355 --> 00:47:00,651
-I said I can't do this anymore!
-Come back inside right now!

499
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,111
What am I going to do
if you leave like this?

500
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:07,115
Don't call me again.
I won't let it slide if you call me again.

501
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,369
Don't leave!

502
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,527
The two of you fought,

503
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,195
didn't you?

504
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:53,662
You claim that you were there
to cheer her up.

505
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,330
Then, why--

506
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,463
Stop with all your nonsense.

507
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,008
Give it to us straight.

508
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,884
What on earth happened that day

509
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,846
that's making you blame everything on me?

510
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,306
Do you want to hear it again?

511
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,683
She said she was going to kill herself

512
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,060
because her husband
was having an affair with you.

513
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,187
We fought because
I was trying to stop her!

514
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,564
Then what about the letter?

515
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,401
She wrote that she'd never forget
what you did even in death.

516
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,653
That's what Jin-ha wrote in her letter.

517
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,614
What could you have possibly done to her

518
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,116
to make her write such a letter
before killing herself?

519
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,285
What wicked act
won't she forget even in death?

520
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,747
Ladies, I feel like
we might be getting too worked up--

521
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:37,956
Answer me!

522
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,418
I told you last time, didn't I?

523
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,463
There's a whole line of people
who'd send me that kind of letter.

524
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:49,009
And I'll do whatever it takes
to find those people and ruin them.

525
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,362
How did you know that the textbook
would be in the trash, Su-in?

526
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:15,494
I saw Dong-seok's erasers
and pencils in there last time.

527
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,121
Did you see who did it?

528
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,540
Yu-bin.

529
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,633
Thank you for being honest, Su-in.

530
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,468
Okay guys, let's start class now.

531
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,595
-Okay.
-Dong-seok, take this.

532
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,806
All right, open up Science 1062.

533
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,109
No matter how much I think about it…

534
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,779
What in the world is going on?

535
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,698
And what's with that letter?

536
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:53,824
I know.

537
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:57,327
Does that mean
this whole thing was Chun-hui's idea?

538
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,833
Su-in's mom, is there anything you know?

539
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:07,671
No, I don't know anything at all.

540
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:12,175
Goodness. I have plans
and I think I'm running late.

541
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,261
-I'll get going.
-All right.

542
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,966
SANGWE BIG MART

543
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:14,488
-Yun-ju, you have to switch shifts now.
-Okay.

544
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,198
Get up. I'll finish up.

545
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,538
Hello.

546
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,753
Hey, what's wrong?

547
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,380
Wait a minute, please.

548
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,840
I'm so sorry.

549
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,395
Excuse me. I'm in a rush.

550
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,815
Just a minute, please.

551
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,316
I'm so sorry.

552
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,320
Goodness.

553
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,696
I'm busy.

554
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,535
Bye.

555
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,832
-Sorry about that.
-Goodness.

556
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,192
If you ever lock the door again,

557
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,821
I'll lock you up forever.

558
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,490
What's going on?

559
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,953
Jul-pin was fooling around
and broke a vase.

560
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,456
We can just sweep it up.

561
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,251
I don't think Jul-pin feels
that he's done anything wrong.

562
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:57,591
Isn't building character
the most important thing?

563
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,634
Isn't that right, Jul-pin?

564
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,451
If you ever lock the door again,

565
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,163
I'll lock you up forever.

566
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:07,035
The cup resembled the one we received.

567
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,162
The only kids that live on the floors
above the security camera

568
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,456
that went to Sangwe Kindergarten
are Jul-pin and Henry.

569
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:15,043
I'm just asking you
to check if you have the cup or not.

570
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,463
Why aren't you sleeping?

571
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:22,133
Oh, I just couldn't fall asleep.

572
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,738
YU-BIN'S MOM

573
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:44,299
CHUN-HUI, HOW DID WE END UP LIKE THIS?

574
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:48,011
LOUIS BENUEL:
SEO JIN-HA'S FUNERAL

575
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,262
YU-BIN'S MOM

576
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,201
-Eun-pyo.
-Yes?

577
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:13,953
Why aren't you going in?

578
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,790
Right. Let's head inside.

579
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,014
LEE EUN-PYO

580
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:20,353
You smell like a mom, ma'am.

581
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,982
I really like you.

582
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,777
Goodness.

583
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,864
How is it possible
that I'm seeing you again like this?

584
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,032
Eun-pyo.

585
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,085
She's so pretty.

586
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,380
Goodness.

587
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,776
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE

588
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,535
Eun-pyo.

589
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,459
It's been a while.

590
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,211
Thank you for coming.

591
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,982
Eun-pyo, come over here.

592
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,693
You too.

593
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,492
Sit here.

594
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:01,180
Back inside the funeral hall,

595
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,642
did you see how Dong-seok's mother
and Henry's father looked at each other?

596
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,019
No, why?

597
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,729
It was strange.

598
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:10,148
As if they were super uncomfortable
with each other.

599
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,358
-They looked uncomfortable?
-Yes.

600
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,028
Then maybe they didn't have an affair.

601
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,488
No, I think they
definitely did have an affair.

602
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:21,492
But I think there's
something else with Chun-hui.

603
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,911
Gosh, the whole thing is a mess.

604
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,913
Jeez, I don't even know anymore.

605
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,707
I just feel bad for the deceased.

606
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,585
What is Henry going to do without a mom?

607
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,879
Let's go in. It's cold.

608
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,672
-You're cold?
-Yes.

609
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,966
I thought I brought it. That's strange.

610
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,395
It's kind of windy.

611
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,444
I'll head home now.

612
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:57,904
You haven't eaten yet.

613
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:01,032
My mom's looking after the boys,
so I need to get back.

614
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,825
-Bye.
-Bye.

615
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:03,910
Get home safe.

616
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:13,044
-Sir, can I talk to you for a moment?
-When did you get here?

617
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:28,518
I knew something was off.

618
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:31,312
She's not one to just die like that.

619
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:35,233
How dare you come here
and act like you care?

620
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:36,526
You little…

621
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:37,735
You killed her.

622
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:38,695
You killed her!

623
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:42,699
Bring her back!

624
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,201
You killed her!

625
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,786
What are you doing?

626
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,623
She didn't kill your daughter.

627
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,000
-What do you know?
-I'm…

628
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,629
her husband.

629
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,132
What is he saying?

630
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:00,758
Let's go.

631
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,144
Goodness.

632
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,422
Are you dumb?

633
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,594
Why would you stand there
and let her hit you?

634
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,391
Why couldn't you tell her she was wrong?

635
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,397
People are more suspicious of you
because you won't stand up for yourself.

636
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,460
It's true…

637
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:23,841
that I went out with Louis.

638
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:28,012
But he dumped me

639
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:31,265
because Jin-ha showed up.

640
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,772
As soon as that happened,

641
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,734
he never even looked back.

642
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,615
It was always like that.

643
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,077
Jin-ha would always…

644
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,248
take away everything

645
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,836
that meant a lot to me.

646
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,967
But more than being dumped,

647
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,513
I couldn't stand the fact that

648
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,975
she took him away from me.

649
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,523
Yes.

650
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,111
I have a miserable life.

651
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:29,615
You might ask why I'm so discontent

652
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:34,495
when I have a husband and children.

653
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:37,790
But…

654
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:42,003
more than anything,

655
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,214
for all of my life,

656
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:49,594
all I wanted was to be a daughter

657
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,931
that my mom could be proud of.

658
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:57,935
So…

659
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:02,607
I did everything I could
to work towards that.

660
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,447
Then I met Jin-ha again.

661
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,784
The one who makes me
feel utterly pathetic.

662
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:21,375
I wanted to know
despite how much time had passed.

663
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,795
I wanted to know why he dumped me.

664
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:30,843
If being curious about that
is enough to say I was having an affair,

665
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,222
then so be it.

666
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:41,103
But my broken pride

667
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,857
kept telling me to do that.

668
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,448
I'm sorry.

669
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,512
But you know what?

670
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:21,102
You're still the most impressive thing
I've ever laid my eyes on.

671
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,149
Also…

672
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,152
I was never around to help…

673
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:34,031
while you were studying.

674
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,664
I've always felt bad about that.

675
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:46,961
Of course, I know.

676
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:52,550
I know you could be
doing greater things in life.

677
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,778
Did you hear?

678
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:16,991
One of the boys from Class Three
molested one of the girls.

679
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:18,659
-Oh, my gosh.
-Who was it?

680
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,619
From what I hear…

681
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,866
Did you know?
They were molested by Dong-seok.

682
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:01,660
My daughter is
the most important thing to me.

683
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:05,206
How are my son and daughter
doing these days?

684
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:07,541
I just want to focus on
raising my kids properly.

685
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:11,170
Even if you open up to a friend,
they're still strangers in the end.

686
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:14,632
I want my dad to be happy,

687
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:18,385
but I also don't want my mom to be sad.

688
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,346
How are you any different
from those women right now?

689
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,807
You should be out there telling them
to stop spreading all that nonsense!

690
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:26,852
But what I want is for your family
to leave this community entirely.

691
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,271
I don't care how messy things get.

692
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:32,858
I'm going to make sure that my boy
comes out of this unscathed.

693
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:39,031
