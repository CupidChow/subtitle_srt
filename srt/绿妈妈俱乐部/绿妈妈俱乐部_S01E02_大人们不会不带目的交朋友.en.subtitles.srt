1
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,700
Are you Korean?

2
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,414
Are you Korean?

3
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,645
This is a Lautrec.

4
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,055
Eun-pyo.

5
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,975
I'm bored.

6
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,986
Hello.

7
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,719
SAINT-ÉPIANNE BEAUX-ARTS
MASTER

8
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,486
Congratulations, Eun-pyo.

9
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,071
You did great.

10
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,409
Thank you.

11
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,412
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

12
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,915
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

13
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,000
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

14
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,420
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

15
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,555
Eun-pyo.

16
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,576
Eun-pyo.

17
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,038
Who would have thought
we'd meet again here of all places?

18
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,010
Doctor Kim Hyeon-jeong,

19
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:47,221
please come to the
internal medicine department.

20
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,362
Dong-ju, let's go.

21
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,411
Are you okay?

22
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,840
Sit still. Don't do that with your feet.

23
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,383
Put your feet down.

24
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:29,013
Are you sure you don't need
a more thorough examination?

25
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,891
No, I'm fine.

26
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,560
You should've just left.
We could've taken a taxi.

27
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,437
No, I could never do that.

28
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,957
Jin-ha told me the two of you ran
into each other in the neighborhood.

29
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,253
Yes. What a coincidence, right?

30
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,339
Mom, why are you talking funny?

31
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,091
Dong-ju, put your feet down.

32
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,677
But why are you talking like that?

33
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,179
Gosh, stay still.

34
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,529
Take care of yourself.

35
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,948
And call me if you need anything.

36
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,035
Okay.

37
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,706
Dong-ju, you cutie.

38
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,293
-I'll see you again.
-Okay.

39
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,974
EPISODE 2
ADULTS DON'T MAKE FRIENDS WITHOUT MOTIVES

40
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,561
Dad!

41
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,814
Dad!

42
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,777
-Hold on, I'm too tired for this.
-Dad.

43
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,821
-How've you been?
-Dad.

44
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,324
-Hey, Eun-pyo.
-Dad.

45
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,705
Where did you go?

46
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,625
I'm so sleepy.

47
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,604
Aren't you guys hungry? Should we eat?

48
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,147
-Yes.
-Yes.

49
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,148
All right.

50
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,735
I'm going to go ask Mom
to cook us something so wait a second.

51
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,487
-Okay, Dad.
-Keep on playing, okay?

52
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,117
Eun-pyo, aren't you going to cook for us?

53
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,494
I'm hungry.

54
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,706
Dong-seok, I want to pull it this time.

55
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,501
By the way, where are my boxers?

56
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,003
I wanted to change,
but I couldn't find them anywhere.

57
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,839
Are you sleeping?

58
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,175
Gosh, we messed that one up.

59
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,473
I want to eat kimchi stew with pork.

60
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,058
In two, three!

61
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,437
Do you think I'm a maid?

62
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,438
What?

63
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,817
You don't even care that I'm in bed
when it's still early in the evening.

64
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,529
The first thing you say after moving in
is "feed me" and "where are my boxers."

65
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,448
What is it? Did something happen?

66
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,827
Forget it. You're not even interested.
Stop pretending you care.

67
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,287
What's wrong?

68
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,706
Are you not feeling well?

69
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,751
There's rice in the rice cooker,
and there are side dishes in the fridge.

70
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,337
Fry up some eggs and feed the kids.

71
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,715
But…

72
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,433
-About my boxers…
-Just leave me alone!

73
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,351
Okay, sorry. Just get some sleep.

74
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,979
One, two, three!

75
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,961
OPEN CLASS DAY FOR PARENTS

76
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,088
Hello.

77
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,716
Hello.

78
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,896
The professor has graced us
with her presence.

79
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,566
I wonder what she'll be teaching us today?

80
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,322
What's going on
between her and Henry's father?

81
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,698
Do they know each other?

82
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,743
Who knows.

83
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,704
That's just ridiculous.

84
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,790
All she did was faint in front of him.

85
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,709
Chun-hui, did she pay you
for the instrument?

86
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,172
She texted me asking
if she could make monthly payments.

87
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,134
Like an installment plan?

88
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,677
She's brazen.

89
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,554
I think we should teach her a lesson.

90
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,432
You don't have to go that far,

91
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,435
you wicked woman.

92
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,104
That's the first time
I've ever heard anyone call me that.

93
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,397
Gosh, I'm speechless.

94
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,444
-Jae-bin's getting out now.
-Dong-seok.

95
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,113
Jul-pin, don't run. You'll fall.

96
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,371
-Your kids are so good at drawing.
-Yes.

97
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,081
Su-in's.

98
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,878
He's good at art too?

99
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,422
He must take after his mother. Jeez.

100
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,215
NAME: HENRY
TITLE: SUNSET

101
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,092
NAME: JUNG DONG-SEOK
TITLE: OUR HOUSE

102
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,135
Your son.

103
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,221
Goodness gracious, look at him.

104
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,433
It looks like he just wanted
to go outside and play.

105
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,020
Oh, my. Hello!

106
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,063
Gosh, you two look great together.

107
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,815
-You made it.
-Hello.

108
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,484
-Hello.
-Hello.

109
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,612
-You guys look great.
-I know, right?

110
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,746
Eun-pyo.

111
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,084
I heard you were ill.

112
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:19,924
And why didn't you mention
that you ran into Louis?

113
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,387
Now that I think about it,

114
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,141
I never told you
that Louis was Henry's father.

115
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,060
You must've been surprised.

116
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,648
Are you doing all right?

117
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,275
Yes.

118
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,986
Did you go back
for a more thorough examination?

119
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,033
Yes. They said I have something
called pernicious anemia.

120
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:49,954
Gosh.

121
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,331
How exhausted were you?

122
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,585
I must've overdone myself for a while.

123
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,256
Is it because of all
the lectures you're doing?

124
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,176
Becoming a professor is great,
but you have to put your health first.

125
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,057
Hello, Henry's mother.

126
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,561
I'm Eun-pyo's relative and Su-in's mom.

127
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,438
We were both
the Green crossing guards last time.

128
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,065
Really?

129
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,944
Eun-pyo is a dear friend of mine.

130
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,654
That's what I'm saying!

131
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:27,533
She's got such a great friend
who she didn't even tell me about.

132
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,285
You're a sneaky one.

133
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,833
Jul-pin.

134
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:40,838
Today, we'll be learning
how to count bundle numbers.

135
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,755
Okay.

136
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,175
In each of these baskets here,

137
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,761
-there are ten chocolates.
-Okay.

138
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:52,224
In total, we have three baskets.

139
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:57,271
And we also have
three chocolates on the floor.

140
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,483
-Isn't that so cool?
-Jung Dong-seok, eyes to the front.

141
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,195
Do your fish sleep
during the night or day?

142
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,615
Jung Dong-seok.

143
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,998
Dong-seok, are you goofing off
because you already know everything?

144
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,376
Let's hear it, Dong-seok.
How many do we have in total?

145
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,545
Dong-seok, pay attention.

146
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,051
There are 495.

147
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,471
Focus, Dong-seok.

148
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,308
Goodness, he's always like that.

149
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,727
Hey, don't be like that.

150
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:42,024
That's why you need to
pay attention Dong-seok.

151
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,735
Then, can Henry tell us the answer?

152
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,737
Yes, there are 33.

153
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,491
Very good. 33 is correct!

154
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:54,620
-Aren't our kids just adorable?
-How did we get 33?

155
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,957
How many are in this basket
that already has ten?

156
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,334
-Three!
-Three!

157
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,127
-Thank you!
-Bye!

158
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,212
OPEN GENTLY

159
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,840
You! I saw everything.

160
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,884
You need to pay attention in class.

161
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,177
Let go of me!

162
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,096
Goodness.

163
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,933
Dong-seok has such a lively personality.

164
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,769
He's like you when you were young.

165
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,814
Right.

166
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,775
How are your parents doing?

167
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,194
Are they still running the paint shop?

168
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,537
You can either click on the link
that says "Afterschool Learning."

169
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,207
Or you can sign up
in the teacher's office.

170
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,919
That's all for the information
I had prepared to share.

171
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,589
Now it's time for us to pick the class
representative for the upcoming semester.

172
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,092
First, I'd like to say
thank you to Jul-pin's mother

173
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,720
for all her hard work
over the last semester.

174
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,638
The next person who'll take her place…

175
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,141
Ma'am.

176
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:02,146
During the first semester, I spent quite
some time pursuing various agendas.

177
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,065
However, there are still some things
I've yet to accomplish.

178
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,861
We still haven't participated
in the Jungse Chungse debate,

179
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,905
and we have yet to complete
the A Day In The Forest program.

180
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:16,410
The Let's Eat Clean, Moms on the Scene
program is also still in the works.

181
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:20,456
So if it's possible, I wanted to ask

182
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,334
if I could serve again
for the upcoming semester.

183
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,544
What?

184
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,879
Well…

185
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,048
Right, I see.

186
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:35,471
Does everyone else agree?

187
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,222
Well…

188
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm Jae-bin's mom.

189
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,854
If I may share my opinion,

190
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:50,736
considering how hard Jul-pin's mother
worked for us over the past semester,

191
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,823
it simply wouldn't be right for us
to ask her to do another semester.

192
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,661
And perhaps as a way of changing things
up for the next semester,

193
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,915
how about we ask Yu-bin's mother
to be our next class representative?

194
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,959
-Why are you doing this?
-I'm just sharing my opinion.

195
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,295
I see.

196
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,130
Well…

197
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,132
What do all the other mothers think?

198
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,218
-I agree.
-I also recommend Yu-bin's mother.

199
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,053
-It's good.
-That's a great idea.

200
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,638
What do you say, Yu-bin's mother?

201
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,308
Are you interested
in volunteering your time for our class?

202
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,726
Help us out.

203
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,228
Goodness.

204
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:29,066
Well, I'm not sure
if I'll have a lot to offer

205
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:34,404
and if I'll do well
but if that's what everybody else wants…

206
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,075
All right. How about we take a vote?

207
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,159
Yes.

208
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,955
Everyone who wants Jul-pin's mother
to serve for another semester,

209
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,414
please raise your hands.

210
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,416
All right.

211
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,379
Now everyone who wants Yu-bin's mother
to be our new representative?

212
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,007
All right, it seems pretty clear.

213
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:58,178
Yu-bin's mother will be our class
representative for the second semester.

214
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,514
A round of applause, please.

215
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,520
Gosh, thank you. I'll do my best.

216
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,649
Come on.

217
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,490
Thank you all for coming.

218
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,910
-Thank you for coming.
-Congratulations.

219
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,954
-Goodbye.
-Why'd you do that?

220
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,248
I'm really looking forward
to the next semester.

221
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,966
Dong-seok's mother,
can I talk to you for a second?

222
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,177
Sure.

223
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,845
The thing is

224
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:44,391
some kids are late bloomers
and that can't be helped,

225
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,686
but when they can't stay seated
and disturb other students

226
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,063
that's where problems can arise.

227
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,691
Most people in this neighborhood
are rather sensitive

228
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,277
when it comes to issues
such as the right to learn.

229
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,074
He's still young,

230
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,621
so won't things like staying seated
get better as time goes on?

231
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,039
I'm sure.

232
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,792
However, the problem is that
in this neighborhood,

233
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,588
there aren't many kids
that run around like him.

234
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,797
I see.

235
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,507
By the way,

236
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,720
you're making sure
Dong-seok is studying at home, right?

237
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,139
He might be having trouble staying still

238
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,683
because he's having
a hard time keeping up in class.

239
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,939
Dong-seok?

240
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,525
Should we have sent him
to after-school classes?

241
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,694
Enjoy your lunch.

242
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,490
I mean, if his homeroom teacher said that,

243
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,575
it's probably serious.

244
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,661
Why are you blindly believing her?

245
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,745
Me?

246
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,666
What I'm saying is
we need to hold our ground.

247
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,334
Dong-seok is my son.

248
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,836
If he takes after me,
he should be a sharp kid.

249
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,715
I have no regrets that we raised him
based on our principles.

250
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,094
Honestly, our society is abnormal

251
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,513
and there's no reason
we have to follow everyone.

252
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,181
Where's your sense of pride?

253
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,144
And he's still in first grade.
He can start now.

254
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,731
You're right. He can start now.

255
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,448
SANGKEMO

256
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,742
-Excuse me.
-I learned something important today.

257
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,539
Hello, everyone.

258
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,084
What?

259
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,462
The new boy's mother?

260
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,513
A CLUB FOR ENLIGHTENED SANGWE MOMS
SANGKEMO

261
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:55,147
All right everybody,
she's our new member, "takeitslow."

262
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,733
And as all of you know,

263
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,776
I'm the class representative
for class three

264
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,612
and the highest-ranking member
of Sangkemo, "broccoli."

265
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,073
I'm "keytohappiness."

266
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,117
I'm "withthetrees."

267
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,160
I see.

268
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,543
All of the mothers in my class
are so stubborn and short-sighted

269
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,671
that I was about to lose all hope,

270
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,092
but now that another mom
from the same class has joined our club,

271
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,094
I do feel a bit better.

272
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,100
But may I ask
why you decided to join our club?

273
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,854
I've been so busy with work

274
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,190
that I know so little
about my children's education

275
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,693
and I don't know what to do as a mom.

276
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,778
Right.

277
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,988
I understand.

278
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,700
We sensible moms need to stick together.

279
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,996
We have to protect our children
from all of the fake news.

280
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,539
-Indeed.
-To that end,

281
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,376
Sangkemo has been meeting up regularly
and moving together as one unit.

282
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,632
In particular, we're trying to pass
a new scholastic anti-discrimination law.

283
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,383
So we're trying to organize a meet-up,

284
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,470
but I'm not sure if it'll be at
Gwanghwamun, City Hall, or Yeouido…

285
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,097
"Takeitslow"!

286
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,599
"Takeitslow"!

287
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,397
Where are you going in such a hurry?

288
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,565
Did you not hear me?

289
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,194
My mind was somewhere else.

290
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,738
I thought you were going to
stay back and talk with me.

291
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,158
Running off like that hurts my feelings.

292
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:37,582
As you know,
you and I are very special comrades.

293
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:42,671
We're true intellectuals who can show
those ignorant, lowly capitalists

294
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,048
what it means to live a proper life.

295
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,678
I heard that you're a professor.
Am I right?

296
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,894
It's important that opinion leaders
like us set a good example.

297
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,397
That's the only way to build
a healthy community.

298
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,276
So, in a few days, to push for
the scholastic anti-discrimination law,

299
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,237
-we're going to try and organize a--
-I'm sorry.

300
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,823
I'm not really that type of mom.

301
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,618
"That type of mom"?

302
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,188
Why are you crying?

303
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,316
Even if you made a mistake,
you should've finished it.

304
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,695
It felt so different
from what it usually feels like!

305
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,947
The instrument was weird!

306
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,118
INCOMING CALL

307
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,672
That's pretty.

308
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,467
SANGWE MOMS ONLINE COMMUNITY

309
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,469
My child is in first grade.

310
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,680
How do I get started
with my child's studies?

311
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:20,018
CRITICAL THINKING, BOOK STUDIES, AND MATH.
MUST TAKE NOTE OF INCORRECT ANSWERS.

312
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,895
LAZY MOTHERS CAN'T RAISE CHILDREN WELL.

313
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,813
"Takeitslow"?

314
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,067
Why do they want to take things slow?

315
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,694
They'll need to master English
in elementary school

316
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,113
so they can focus on math
in middle school.

317
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,825
TEAM LEADER

318
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,496
Are you playing around with the comments?

319
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,458
You're supposed to discreetly
steer the conversation toward the academy.

320
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,754
If you keep on commenting like this,
I can't pay you 1,000 won per comment.

321
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,300
All right.

322
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,805
I was actually trying to
come off more as a member,

323
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,015
but was that too much?

324
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:07,357
Just use common sense
and try not to get banned like last time.

325
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,150
She's so annoying.

326
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,610
I'm sorry.

327
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,866
This brat is half my age and
always has to have the last word.

328
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,370
What? 880,000 won?

329
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,832
Classes for gifted students
all start at 800,000 won.

330
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:27,252
But still, that's insane
for a first-grader.

331
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,509
I told you we shouldn't have
pushed ourselves with the move.

332
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,929
Would I be doing this
if Su-in was just a normal girl?

333
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,974
There was no one who could
teach her in our old neighborhood.

334
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,856
I don't know why
we have to live like this.

335
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,985
I work my butt off
and pour all of it into education.

336
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,281
Stop saying things like that.
Aren't you tired of saying it?

337
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,825
It's what parents are supposed to do.

338
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,661
You think having a baby
is all it takes to be a parent?

339
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,421
I've been slaving away all day.
Is it too much to have some meat?

340
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,006
Look at this.

341
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,841
We had some the other day.

342
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,593
What did we have?

343
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,763
Don't you remember?
There was beef in the seaweed soup.

344
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,349
It wasn't cheap to make that.

345
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,939
Su-in, look at this.

346
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,566
It was all one piece…

347
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,240
Hello.

348
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,202
Oh, hello.

349
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,916
HAVE YOU EATEN?
TRANSLATE

350
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,919
We both got hired
around the same time, right?

351
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,754
Yes.

352
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,883
Our children are also in the same class.
We have a lot in common.

353
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,473
I can speak basic Korean.

354
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:05,892
Right.

355
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,813
What do you say
we carpool for the commute?

356
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,899
I can learn Korean from you

357
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,068
and you can learn English from me.

358
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,532
Nobody seems to want
to speak to me in Korean.

359
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,826
Does everyone hate me?

360
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:33,920
Did I do something
to hurt your feelings, Eun-pyo?

361
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,471
NEW MESSAGE FROM LEE SU-HYEON

362
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,854
Jin-ha, how are you doing?

363
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,357
I miss you very much, my daughter.

364
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,387
LET'S STUDY THE NUMBERS 60, 70, 80, 90

365
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,184
Jung Dong-seok.

366
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,228
Sit up straight and don't slouch.

367
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,025
This isn't fun.

368
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,528
Listen to me explain it first,

369
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,323
and then you can tell me what's not fun.

370
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,367
-Do you know what a bundle number is?
-Yes, I know.

371
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:47,952
Where are you going?

372
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,704
The bathroom!

373
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,581
You just went!

374
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,707
I'm pooping!

375
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,876
My goodness.

376
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,587
Mom!

377
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,465
Yes?

378
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,717
Can I go play outside?

379
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,470
Come on, Mom!

380
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:08,014
I'm getting a headache.

381
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,849
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

382
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,976
-Shoot!
-Wait for me!

383
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,815
Eun-pyo.

384
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,110
If you’re free tomorrow,
do you want to have a cup of tea?

385
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:27,408
SORRY, I'M A BIT BUSY

386
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,535
Eun-pyo!

387
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,536
Hello.

388
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,204
-Hello.
-What are you doing here?

389
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,875
Su-in, go play. Dong-seok's over there.

390
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,127
Let's play tag, guys!

391
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,712
-Okay.
-I'll be it.

392
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,923
They love running around.

393
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:42,841
Hurry!

394
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:47,095
Boys need to run around
to let off all of that extra energy.

395
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,432
Yun-ju.

396
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,434
Do you know

397
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,145
of any academies for Dong-seok
in this neighborhood?

398
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,022
Why?

399
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,693
Are you trying to be
one of those kinds of moms now?

400
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,575
Hello. What brings you to the playground?

401
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,659
I know, right?

402
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,911
-Yun-ju…
-Yes?

403
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,205
Do you mind watching
the kids for a second?

404
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,086
Chun-hui went to search for a new academy
so she asked me to watch them,

405
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,714
but I completely forgot
about the meeting I had to go to.

406
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,466
I just need one hour.

407
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,261
Sure, go ahead.

408
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,388
-Great. I'm counting on you.
-Sure.

409
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,932
-I'll be back soon.
-All right, bye.

410
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,729
Go play, guys.

411
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,694
Gosh, I think I have a serious problem
with letting people step all over me.

412
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,822
I'm sure she's still going to
get all the credit.

413
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,532
This is so annoying.

414
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,333
That woman is the worst
out of all of them.

415
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,545
She's got nothing but she always sticks
next to Chun-hui and bosses people around.

416
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,672
Gosh, so annoying.

417
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,052
Dong-ju!

418
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,139
-My gosh.
-Guys, what's going on? Come here.

419
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,558
-Come here. Dong-seok, come on!
-Quickly, come on!

420
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,226
-Come on!
-Dong-ju.

421
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,856
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

422
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,192
Something fell from the sky.

423
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,276
What?

424
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,327
Wait, my hairband!

425
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,704
-Yu-bin.
-Yu-bin!

426
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,539
Yu-bin, it's dangerous!

427
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,958
No, stop. Eun-pyo!

428
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,751
No!

429
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,439
Yu-bin, are you okay? Come here.

430
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,130
Yu-bin!

431
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,840
Mom.

432
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:30,925
Let me see.

433
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,593
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

434
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,594
Yes.

435
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,227
Chun-hui, it's not what you think.
Yu-bin looked so thirsty

436
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,565
so I asked Su-in's mom to look
after her while I went to the store.

437
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,735
-I didn't know this would happen.
-Hey! That's not right.

438
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:53,072
You're the one who tossed her to me
so you could go run your errands.

439
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,158
Mom.

440
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,744
That lady saved me.

441
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,886
You really didn't have to do this.

442
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,721
The wound is pretty deep.

443
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,515
If it were any deeper,
you would've had to go to a hospital.

444
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,143
You're very impressive.

445
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,063
You're like a real nurse.

446
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,277
I watched my husband treat his patients
and picked up a few things.

447
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,537
-You're all done.
-Okay.

448
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:47,210
OPEN DOOR
CALL

449
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,798
Chun-hui.

450
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,426
Chun-hui.

451
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,222
Your place is so nice. This is so fancy.

452
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,100
The furniture is all so nice.

453
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,977
I think I've seen this on TV before.

454
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,189
I saw on the Internet
that a famous designer made it.

455
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,524
It's that one, right?

456
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,327
What did the management office say?

457
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,622
It's hard to see everything
on the security camera.

458
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:28,042
They moved it to the middle of the complex
last month because they can't

459
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:32,130
see the license plates when
there are accidents in the parking lot.

460
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,176
They also said they can't show us
anything unless we're the police.

461
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,429
So I made a fuss and asked them to see it.

462
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,607
Maybe it's some sort
of highly intelligent criminal?

463
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,695
Are the only kids that went to
Sangwe Kindergarten from building 901

464
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,905
Henry and Jul-pin?

465
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,032
Yes.

466
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,452
Why? Are you suspecting something?

467
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,746
To be honest,

468
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,040
I took a good look earlier

469
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,044
and the broken shards
were flashing all kinds of colors.

470
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,924
We broke a cup at our place

471
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,720
and it flashed the exact same colors.

472
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,473
It was a cup we got
from a glass art field trip.

473
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,105
We might be able to find the suspect
more easily than I thought.

474
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,905
Also…

475
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,116
forget about the instrument fee.

476
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,243
Sorry?

477
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,954
You saved my daughter's life.

478
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,290
If anything, I should compensate.

479
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,250
It wouldn't be right to take your money.

480
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,629
How could I do that?
It's not a small amount.

481
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,757
If it's really too much,

482
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,426
then just buy me a few cups of coffee.

483
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,013
Lucky you.

484
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,932
Chun-hui!

485
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,558
Chun-hui, you're amazing.

486
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,352
How are you so generous?

487
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,479
I want to be your fan!

488
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,943
I'm so jealous of you.

489
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,987
How did you get Chun-hui
to like you all of a sudden?

490
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,782
You even got rid of
that debt in one swoop.

491
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,451
-Must be nice.
-How could I do that though?

492
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,911
I should pay what I owe.

493
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,122
There it is. You and that pride.

494
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,458
Just forget about it and say "thank you."

495
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,919
You saved her kid.
That money isn't a big deal.

496
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,297
I'm jealous. Lucky you.

497
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:42,927
Eun-pyo.

498
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,891
It sounds like Chun-hui thinks
Jul-pin might be responsible, right?

499
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,560
Why?

500
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,564
I mean, they've been at each
other's throats for a while now.

501
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,069
Jul-pin's mom actually got remarried.

502
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:06,367
A married woman with two kids
fell in love with a movie director

503
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,662
and after some scandalous dating,
they got married.

504
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:14,125
I wouldn't be surprised if the kids
and the step-dad aren't on the best terms.

505
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,549
But why don't you think Henry did it?

506
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,759
Come on, it can't be Henry.

507
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,304
Do you know how much
his parents dote on him?

508
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,055
I mean, you'd know better than I do.

509
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,652
Put your shoes on properly
or you'll end up tripping.

510
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,820
Okay.

511
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,660
Henry, what will you be learning today?

512
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,913
About the origin of languages.

513
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,749
What we learned last class

514
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,918
was that there is an anatomical condition

515
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:43,130
that had to be met in order
for humans to be able to speak.

516
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,051
The posterior cavity
of the throat needs to drop down

517
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,470
in order for humans
to start pronouncing consonants.

518
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,973
And they surmise that this particular
piece of evolution happened to humans

519
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,558
around 300,000 years ago.

520
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,646
But of course, in addition to
the proper anatomical conditions,

521
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,440
we also need things
to work together with the brain.

522
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,527
-Good job.
-Thank you.

523
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:12,284
So you think one of my children did it?

524
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,953
-Yes.
-Why?

525
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,996
I just explained it to you.

526
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:20,709
-The cup resembled the one we received.
-Henry, come here. It's dangerous.

527
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,336
-The only kids that live on the floors
-Okay.

528
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,339
above the security camera that went to
Sangwe Kindergarten are Jul-pin and Henry.

529
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,443
I'm just asking you
to check if you have the cup or not.

530
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,194
I'll leave if you check.

531
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,614
What makes you think
you have any right to treat me like this?

532
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,700
Are you honestly asking me that right now?

533
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,246
If you were in my shoes,
would you do nothing

534
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,039
if your child nearly lost her life?

535
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,754
Are you sure

536
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:10,968
you're not targeting my children
intentionally because of old grudges?

537
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:26,108
-What's all that ruckus outside?
-It's nothing you need to worry about.

538
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,402
It's just there's some
half-baked woman out there

539
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,237
who's trying to drag
our family through the mud.

540
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,948
-I was out there arguing with her.
-What did she say?

541
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,118
A cup dropped on the playground

542
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,288
and she came asking if it was our kids.

543
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,500
I'm sick and tired of
these women's habit of getting suspicious

544
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,126
without any evidence.

545
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,962
They're ignorant, low,
and they only care about fake news.

546
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,381
Just don't expect so much
from your fellow humans.

547
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,301
Humans are foolish creatures anyway.

548
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:58,057
It feels like what little hope I have left
of the human race is dying.

549
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,269
We have Dutch coffee brewed in the fridge.

550
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,813
I just felt like having drip coffee.

551
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,024
Are you hungry?

552
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,359
You want some rice cakes?

553
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,862
No thanks. I can't write anything
if I eat too much.

554
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,243
Dong-seok's mom.

555
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,830
Are you getting back from somewhere?

556
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,625
I was just going to the supermarket.

557
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,590
How are your kids adapting?

558
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,468
They're doing fine.

559
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:39,390
They say stress from moving is
on par with stress from divorce.

560
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:43,435
It must be harder for the kids
to move to an unfamiliar neighborhood.

561
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,486
When you have time,

562
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,823
let's go to a kids cafe
so Dong-seok can blow off some steam.

563
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,366
Sure.

564
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,413
By the way…

565
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:11,130
do you know of a tutor
or an academy nearby?

566
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,675
I don't know much about the area.

567
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,928
Su-in's mom didn't tell you anything?

568
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,765
Then again,

569
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:26,645
people don't share things like that
even with family in this neighborhood.

570
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,234
Right.

571
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,071
I heard you're best friends
with Henry's mother.

572
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,533
I'm sure both her
and her husband would know a lot.

573
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,453
Right.

574
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,751
Just forget I asked.

575
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,023
HOW TO RAISE A BOY USING YOUR INSIDE VOICE

576
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:13,275
THINGS PARENTS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
THEIR ELEMENTARY STUDENT’S EDUCATION

577
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,644
YU-BIN’S MOM

578
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,022
THE TOP 1% MOMS IN SANGWE-DONG COMMUNITY

579
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,662
Are you done chewing?

580
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,375
Spit it out.

581
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,628
How many times did you chew?

582
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,719
You don't remember
how many times you chewed?

583
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:30,144
Why is it so hard for you to focus
on such a simple experiment?

584
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:34,356
Are you going to eat your meal all night
and go to bed without studying?

585
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,278
Are you sleepy?

586
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,238
Go eat some ice.

587
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,242
Be quick.

588
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,514
INCOMING CALL

589
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,525
Really?

590
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,027
Really.

591
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,613
All the parents in this area
want to send their kids

592
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,656
to Geoseong University School
of Gifted Students.

593
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,285
Then schools with the Office of Education
and other gifted students schools.

594
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,245
Why?

595
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,415
That's how you get into
the community with all the smart kids.

596
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:38,504
They have to at least attend
a school for the gifted.

597
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,089
Eun-pyo.

598
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,800
Normal kids will live normal lives.

599
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,095
Mom, I want more rice cakes.
We finished it.

600
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,598
Stop eating.
We're going to have dinner later.

601
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,682
Give me more.

602
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,267
Stop eating.

603
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,687
I don't understand it at all.

604
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,357
Do they really have to do that?

605
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,860
Goodness.

606
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,445
You know,

607
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:08,158
I don't understand how someone
as innocent as you still exists in Korea.

608
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,162
Eun-pyo.

609
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:16,667
What's the percentage of kids
that go to top-tier universities in Korea?

610
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,044
-What's this? Is it the sea?
-Yes.

611
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,630
The top three percent.

612
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,341
Then what about gifted schools
and science schools?

613
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,303
The top three percent.

614
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,056
What I'm saying is that

615
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:34,184
those schools aren't there
to pick out the gifted students.

616
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:37,104
They select the kids
that will go to top-tier universities.

617
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,731
So all the moms in this area are dying
to get their kids into that school.

618
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,568
From competitions to certificates,
they do it all.

619
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,577
How've you been?

620
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,788
Hello.

621
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,331
Hi.

622
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,044
Hello.

623
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,713
Hello.

624
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,673
-Hello.
-Hi.

625
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,468
You must've planned on seeing each other.

626
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:12,222
I was just here to drop off some food
and got caught up talking.

627
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,101
No. I was just passing by.

628
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,645
Enjoy your time.

629
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,857
No, I should be getting home.

630
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,941
Su-in.

631
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,285
-Rock, rock, rock!
-Jeez, I was close.

632
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,330
Mom, can I go over to Henry's house?

633
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,833
No. What are you talking about?

634
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,920
But Henry has so many
cool toys at his house.

635
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,380
Me too.

636
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:46,965
Mom.

637
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,636
Can Dong-seok come over to play?

638
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,181
That sounds good to me.

639
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,310
Eun-pyo.

640
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:01,355
Why don't you come over if you have time?

641
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:06,610
Miss Nam just baked some apple pie,
so you can try some of that too.

642
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,614
Dong-seok.

643
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,034
What kind of cool toys
does Henry have at home?

644
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,118
I'm so curious.

645
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,705
There are a lot of trains
and there's even a drone.

646
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,290
A drone?

647
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,001
They are a lot of expensive toys.

648
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,839
-And you have a lot of those too?
-Yes.

649
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,134
Chun-hui! Are you just getting back?

650
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,137
Yes, I was picking up Yu-bin
from her academy.

651
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,889
-Hi, Yu-bin.
-Hello.

652
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,809
Is everyone headed somewhere?

653
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:42,479
We were actually on our way
to Henry's place, so if you have time…

654
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,191
Would it be okay if she came?

655
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,661
This is going to be so much fun!

656
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,579
What should we play?

657
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,811
So you two

658
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:26,106
went to the same university
and studied abroad in France together?

659
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,692
Yes.

660
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,694
Before I got too homesick,

661
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,698
Eun-pyo would always give me kimchi
and other pickled side dishes.

662
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,575
She helped me out so much.

663
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:37,993
Goodness.

664
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,036
What a heart-touching friendship.

665
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,539
I…

666
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:47,711
I have an upset stomach.
Could I have a cup of latte?

667
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,421
Of course.

668
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,721
So Dong-seok's mom finished
her undergrad in France,

669
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,473
and finished her doctorate in Korea?

670
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,725
She's quite the talent.

671
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,978
Where do you hold your lectures?

672
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,064
-Let me take that for you.
-Thank you.

673
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,741
Eun-pyo…

674
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:23,747
left France before she completed
her doctorate program.

675
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,712
At the time, everyone was talking about

676
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,882
how she was on track to become
the youngest to complete the program.

677
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,759
We were all looking forward to it.

678
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,888
I don't think I ever heard
the whole story either.

679
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:50,690
Why did you drop out?

680
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,652
You were on the verge of completing it.

681
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,832
Henry's mom.

682
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:12,003
Perhaps you're pressing a subject
that Eun-pyo isn't too keen on sharing.

683
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,465
I'm going to the bathroom.

684
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,661
LEE EUN-PYO

685
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,500
Eun-pyo, hurry up.

686
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,511
Hey.

687
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,097
What's that smell?

688
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,349
What?

689
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:50,268
It smells like some kind of oil.

690
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,645
Oil?

691
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,654
Oh, you mean the linseed oil
and the turpentine?

692
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,991
I use this to help mix my oil paint.

693
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,619
It smells really bad, doesn't it?

694
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,833
My dad's actually an oil painter.

695
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,752
He's a professor at Geoseong University.

696
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,858
Hey, Lee Eun-pyo!

697
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,945
Get some paint thinner and pour it in!

698
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,286
That's good.

699
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,334
Gray.

700
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,757
Pour the whole thing in.

701
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,638
That's enough.

702
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,035
What are you doing in here?

703
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,829
Oh, I just…

704
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,960
Do you want to get back into art?

705
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,674
I figured.

706
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:46,676
I'd expect as much.

707
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:52,098
I think it's such a shame
that you stopped.

708
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,017
You had

709
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,311
all the talent.

710
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,278
But you know…

711
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,367
I don't know how this might sound,

712
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,744
but…

713
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,831
you should be careful around Yu-bin's mom.

714
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,042
Why?

715
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:24,506
She sort of has a dark side to her.

716
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:27,300
I'm also doing my best
to not get involved--

717
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,803
-What makes you say that?
-What?

718
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,096
Are you close to her?

719
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,723
No.

720
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,102
Then what makes you say that?
You have no ground to stand on.

721
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,354
No, I was just

722
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,981
looking out for you.

723
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,566
Mom.

724
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,859
Yes?

725
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,697
Let's go home. It's not fun anymore.

726
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,786
Dong-ju, did you not enjoy the movie?

727
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,790
I can't understand
anything they're saying.

728
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,375
Oh, dear.

729
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,293
Is that why?

730
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,213
-Yes.
-Goodness.

731
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,173
Let's go.

732
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,389
Guys, it's time to go home now.

733
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:18,017
Stop watching cartoons.
Su-in, let's go home.

734
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,812
I want to go later.

735
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,980
It's time to go home.

736
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,910
There aren't any subtitles--

737
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:37,996
He fell.

738
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,914
How did he fall in there?

739
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,461
How do you fall in like that?

740
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,338
Did you know? Is he…

741
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,925
So they do listening in the mornings.

742
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,472
Then do you do that every morning?

743
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,640
-Everyday.
-I see.

744
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,894
Would you by any chance
have an easier list

745
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,730
or a fun list to recommend?

746
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,232
This is all stuff
you can find after a quick search.

747
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:11,821
I was wondering
if there's something that Yu-bin likes.

748
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,224
I'm sorry…

749
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,726
about earlier.

750
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:28,106
I never should've brought up France.

751
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:30,024
The conversation
just kind of led that way.

752
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,403
I think…

753
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,656
you must've been pretty taken aback.

754
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:45,623
But there's no reason
for you to feel bad about it.

755
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,961
You came here, finished your doctorate,
and are giving lectures now.

756
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:52,338
That's not something
everyone is capable of.

757
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:57,510
I'm so proud to see you
living your best life.

758
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,806
On that note…

759
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,312
Here.

760
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,525
I made these to sell
at my upcoming exhibition.

761
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,569
I only made ten of them.

762
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,364
I thought it'd be nice
for you to wear it to your lectures.

763
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,188
It suits you so well.

764
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,233
I knew it would suit you.

765
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,526
It's so pretty.

766
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,365
Do you like it?

767
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:28,976
You know,

768
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,354
I was thrilled

769
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,941
that my dear old friend
became a neighborhood friend.

770
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,531
I couldn't open up

771
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:46,577
about my feelings to people I met
after becoming an adult.

772
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,416
How is it…

773
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,626
for you?

774
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,111
Seo Jin-ha!

775
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,965
Why are you doing this to me?

776
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,510
Doing what?

777
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:27,386
You're doing this to me on purpose.

778
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:29,931
You're trying to make me feel small.

779
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,683
What's wrong, Eun-pyo?

780
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:33,726
Right.

781
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:38,648
Ever since you were young,
you had a weird way of messing

782
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:41,943
with other people's emotions
with that innocent face of yours.

783
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,947
And you always took advantage of me.

784
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,282
How could you…

785
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:50,785
say that?

786
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,954
You think I don't know your true colors?

787
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:55,456
Acting like you care.

788
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,708
Acting like you feel sorry.

789
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:02,004
But in reality,
you dig up on others' sore spots--

790
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,513
I'm sorry, Eun-pyo.

791
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,932
I was just--

792
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,610
We're even now, right?

793
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:25,922
I heard he's on the blacklist
in the class.

794
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,132
Please help me, Yu-bin's mother.

795
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:31,594
It's up to you to find
what's right for your kids.

796
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,638
Seeking advice won't solve it.

797
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:36,015
I'm going to transfer
Dong-seok to another school.

798
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,684
You didn't know?
I didn't like her back then.

799
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,812
Why was she jealous of me?
I'm nothing to be jealous of.

800
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:45,566
Can you pretend you don't know me?

801
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:49,195
If you ran into your ex-boyfriend
in the neighborhood…

802
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,822
I wanted to make up before I leave.

803
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,492

01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:56,327
What's your name?

805
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,787
Eun-pyo.

806
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,956
Lee Eun-pyo.
