1
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,204
Be honest.

2
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,291
Weren't you angry
that she took your boyfriend?

3
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:30,507
The thing is, Henry's mother said

4
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,803
she took him from you on purpose.

5
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,116
I mean…

6
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,660
Why would you do something
that I didn't ask you to do?

7
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,121
Why do you have to
keep making things worse?

8
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,165
If I don't do anything, what will you do?

9
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,794
Did you think this will go away on its own
when it was already spread all over?

10
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:11,464
It's important to come up with narratives
first in these kinds of situations.

11
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,466
Her husband wanted to cover it up.

12
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,762
He didn't want his wife's private life
to go public, so he said to cover it up.

13
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,557
You can say she was stalking you
and justify yourself then.

14
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,226
What have you done
that you're so scared of?

15
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,563
-Either way, I spread the photo. So stop…
-Mr. Oh.

16
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,773
We're ready to move on.
Where should we go?

17
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,066
Don't you know how to knock?

18
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:53,089
When did you grow up to be
so wonderful and beautiful like this?

19
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,843
I had no idea.

20
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,225
Wait.

21
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,979
How can I best support you?

22
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,607
Should I find a good teacher for you?

23
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,319
Do you want to try
the entrance exams for the art school?

24
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,029
Mom.

25
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,034
Take it slow, right?

26
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,535
Yes, we'll take it slow.

27
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,998
Come here.

28
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,210
Thank you, Yeong-bin.

29
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,755
Thank you.

30
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,159
HUSBAND

31
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,498
Hey.

32
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,417
Hey, go get a cash advance
and come over here right now.

33
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,253
What are you talking about right now?

34
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,755
-Are you--
-Just shut it and bring me the money!

35
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,966
I'm trying to make it all back right now.

36
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,509
Hey.

37
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,552
-That's my spot.
-Okay.

38
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,847
All right, let's play.

39
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,573
What's your business here?

40
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,868
I'm Kim Ju-seok's wife.

41
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,820
You're here.

42
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,904
Quick, give it to me.

43
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,614
Hurry up!

44
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,618
What's this?

45
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,748
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

46
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,958
Is she out of her mind?

47
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,754
Are you joking with me?

48
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,922
You didn't even bring the cash.

49
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,716
What did I do wrong?

50
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,551
What did I do wrong?

51
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,970
You really don't know what you did wrong?

52
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,306
I just gambled a bit
because I got stressed.

53
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,599
Why are you overreacting?

54
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,185
Hey, if everyone got divorced
over stuff like this,

55
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,270
how many people do you think
would actually stay married?

56
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,272
"Gambled a bit"?

57
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,441
Yes. What's so wrong about it?

58
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,068
Because of your gambling,

59
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,363
we're living under
a mountain of debt right now.

60
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,157
Because of your gambling,

61
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,495
I had to go out to work every night
even though I knew how dangerous it was.

62
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,500
Don't you know I did everything I could
to try and keep our family together?

63
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,002
Damn it, every single thing
you say pisses me off!

64
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,964
You got married empty-handed!

65
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,312
Do whatever you want.
I'm going to reveal everything you did.

66
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,652
If I go to the cops and tell them about
what kind of work you've been doing,

67
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,239
do you think they will let you
see the kids again?

68
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,786
You bastard!

69
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,496
-You call yourself a human being?
-Damn it!

70
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,081
-Are you a human being?
-Goodness!

71
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,874
Hey!

72
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,002
Go ahead and reveal everything!

73
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,714
If you want to reveal everything,
you better let it all out, okay?

74
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,930
I'm the one who messed up.

75
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,435
I'm the idiot that married
a piece of shit like you

76
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,563
and put up with all of your bullshit
just because you were a doctor.

77
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,939
Hey,

78
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,276
but no matter what you do,
you're not going to change my mind.

79
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,777
Do you want to know why?

80
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,699
We're already standing
on the edge of a cliff, you damn idiot.

81
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,493
There's nothing that can scare me anymore!

82
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,451
EPISODE 14
YELLOW LIGHT

83
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,044
Hey, your gut feeling
was right on the mark.

84
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,379
As soon as the bigger guys got taken out,

85
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,548
they started popping up all over the place

86
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,134
and selling things to people again.

87
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,427
What are they selling?

88
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,596
They're selling all kinds of stuff
through various supply routes.

89
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,766
Anyway, I asked Hyeok-ho to draft up
a report on what we know so far.

90
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,767
Come take a look.

91
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,726
Okay.

92
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,479
I'll be there after dropping my kids off
at the academy and kindergarten.

93
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,190
Why? Is Eun-pyo not well?

94
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,025
I don't know. She said she's not well.

95
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,693
She's lying down in bed.

96
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,863
Did you do something wrong again?
Just apologize.

97
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,406
I'm hanging up.

98
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,790
-Let's eat boys.
-Okay.

99
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,876
-Sit down. There you go.
-This looks good.

100
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,170
-Thank you for the meal.
-Sure.

101
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,140
Did you take your medicine?

102
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,184
Yes.

103
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,937
If you're not well,
you should go see a doctor.

104
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,189
Do you want me to give you a ride?

105
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,858
It's fine.
Just take care of the kids for me.

106
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,237
You were overexerting yourself these days.

107
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,407
From taking care of Dong-seok
to preparing for your lecture.

108
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,287
Are you sure everything's okay?

109
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,956
I could hear you
talking in your sleep intensely.

110
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,376
I guess it's because I'm sick.

111
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,255
Get some rest.

112
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,303
Righ, I left an envelope for you
on the side table, so take a look at it.

113
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,470
Why?

114
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,932
I think it was the lady who lives
in the building across from us

115
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,475
or a family member of hers.

116
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,061
She told me to pass it on to you.

117
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,688
Which lady?

118
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,939
I don't remember exactly.

119
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,942
Anyway, I left it right here
so take a look at it.

120
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,549
The whole neighborhood is suffering
from the hostility and jealousy

121
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,217
that we hold against each other.

122
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,471
But as usual,

123
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,766
all of us are both
the victims and the perpetrators.

124
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,527
With that in mind,

125
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,405
my family has decided to look at things
holistically and opt for forgiveness

126
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,407
instead of trying to find
everyone's fault.

127
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,078
We will be covering up everything
that has happened until now.

128
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,166
And for those who spread personal
information without my family's consent,

129
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,460
I plan on taking legal action,

130
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,672
so please refrain from spewing
any more of your baseless slander.

131
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,534
Dong-seok's mom!

132
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,622
Hello, Ms. Nam.

133
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,499
You're still coming out for work?

134
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,878
Louis asked me to help out
because he didn't want strangers to do it.

135
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,297
Jeez, there was so much to organize.

136
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,759
But we got all of it done today,
so I won't have to come starting tomorrow.

137
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,344
You must've worked really hard.

138
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,977
Did you see the photo
I gave you yesterday?

139
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,813
Goodness.

140
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,691
I told your husband
that he has to give it to you.

141
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,194
I completely forgot about it. What was it?

142
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,320
Oh, gosh.

143
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,867
I had no idea who to talk to
about it for the longest time.

144
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,453
I really had no idea what to do.

145
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,831
The only person I could think of was you.

146
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,750
Goodness, why was it so hard
to get you on the phone?

147
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,545
I usually don't pick up calls
from numbers I don't know.

148
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,798
But what was the photo of?

149
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:45,347
I found it while I was cleaning.

150
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,516
By any chance…

151
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,852
was it a photo of Jin-ha?

152
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,729
Ms. Seo?

153
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,649
No, it's not that.

154
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,610
Oh, gosh.

155
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:03,657
I didn't know it then, but the man from
downstairs was really quite strange.

156
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,659
Wait, so they just left it there?

157
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,828
What would they have done then?

158
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,914
You should've called
security or something.

159
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,750
How could I call security?

160
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,835
You're so frustrating Jin-ha.

161
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,879
If I was there,
I wouldn't have let them be.

162
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,965
They used to have
such a great time together.

163
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,761
Then all of a sudden, she started to
get serious more and more often.

164
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,555
What do you think you're doing?

165
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,432
Jin-ha, that was never my intention.

166
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,560
This isn't going to work for me.
Please don't cross the line.

167
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,646
What are you talking about?
That wasn't my--

168
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,773
I told you to stop it, seriously!

169
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,245
Then the next time the man came over,

170
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,872
she asked me not to
open the door for him anymore.

171
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,253
Ms. Seo is working on something
at the moment

172
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,712
and said she won't be seeing anyone.

173
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,716
Could you just tell her that I want to
explain something about the other day?

174
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,761
-Leave, please.
-No. Excuse me, Jin-ha!

175
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,597
Gosh, be quiet.
Are you trying to get me fired?

176
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,141
Just tell her that
there's something I need to explain.

177
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,184
I'm sorry.

178
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,478
-Don't you close the door on me.
-Please leave.

179
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,896
I'm going to close the door.

180
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:22,695
But there was something about
the look on his face that scared me.

181
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,576
Sir!

182
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,163
Wait, sir!

183
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,131
Ma'am, what's going on?

184
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,384
I left something in there.
Could you open it up for me please?

185
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,012
-Okay. Just a second.
-Thank you.

186
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,006
My Jeanne Hébuterne.

187
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,385
Now let's finish our fierce and beautiful

188
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,054
love story.

189
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,943
Now that I look back at it,
the man was a pervert.

190
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:48,238
Goodness. How could he do
such a thing to a married woman?

191
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,789
Can't you tell
after hearing her flirting like that?

192
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:02,002
It's proof that Henry's mother
stalked my husband.

193
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,549
My husband is the victim here.

194
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,053
I admire your friendship

195
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:17,059
but remember that your actions
could hurt an innocent man.

196
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,108
I took him from her on purpose.

197
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,987
I wanted to crush Eun-pyo
into a miserable pulp

198
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,906
when she was at the height of her glory.

199
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,827
Eun-pyo.

200
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,620
What mattered…

201
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,499
was showing Eun-pyo
that what she thought of as hers

202
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:44,253
might not actually be hers.

203
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,257
MY JEANNE HÉBUTERNE

204
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,010
NOW LET'S FINISH OUR FIERCE
AND BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY

205
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,317
This guy's the one who's in charge.

206
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,612
They are the dealers
and these guys are the suppliers.

207
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,199
And then there's the needle lady.

208
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,120
Altogether, the network is comprised
of well over 20 members.

209
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,456
They make most of their moves
through hostess bars and clubs,

210
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,625
and they secretly suggest drugs
before turning them into regulars.

211
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,003
-What do they sell?
-Meth, cannabis oils, fentanyl,

212
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,714
nalbuphine, and even etomidate.
They sell it all.

213
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,799
They call themselves
"the general hospital."

214
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,301
Who's that Needle Lady?

215
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,179
There were a lot of people
looking for propofol and etomidate.

216
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,724
I think they were trying to be clever
and came up with a specialized service.

217
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,976
Jeez, these guys are something.

218
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,064
I think this whole thing might be
even bigger than we anticipated.

219
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,900
It's going to be hard to handle,
so team up with Team One and Team Three

220
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,610
and get moving as soon as possible.

221
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,279
If you play it right,
you could be promoted.

222
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,281
Make sure you don't miss
any little detail.

223
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,200
-All right, get moving.
-Yes, sir.

224
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,911
I'm going to check the account details.

225
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,716
NEEDLE LADY

226
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,470
I'm sorry I haven't been
taking care of you.

227
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,223
I was completely out of it
because of Yu-bin.

228
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,185
It's fine, don't worry about it.

229
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,522
Even parents can be ashamed sometimes.

230
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,078
Hey, Nurse Kim.

231
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,081
Yes, long time no talk.

232
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,375
Have you been well?

233
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,128
Right.

234
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,171
I actually called

235
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,716
because I was thinking
of maybe working again.

236
00:18:56,218 --> 00:19:00,305
You know, even something like
personal nursing is okay.

237
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,059
If there's really nothing else,
I'd be open to hospice care.

238
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,937
Oh…

239
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,897
I see.

240
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,483
No.

241
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:16,405
It's just doing nothing at home
doesn't seem like the best idea.

242
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,949
Yes, okay.

243
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,118
Yes, sure. Thank you.

244
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,162
Let's meet up to eat sometime.

245
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,830
All right, bye.

246
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,312
It's not the end of the world
even if you get divorced these days.

247
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,734
We're better off. He didn't really do much
as a son-in-law anyway.

248
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,868
I'll come to tidy the place up.

249
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,164
And I'll move in as soon as
the kids get back from camp.

250
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,583
Bear with me even if things get hectic.

251
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,667
Goodness.

252
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,712
I'd love it if you lived
with me for longer.

253
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,132
My only concern is that
the kids might not like it.

254
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,685
Do you happen to know

255
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,148
what that guy is up to these days?

256
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,903
He used to jump to attention
at every little thing you said.

257
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,323
Now that I think about it,

258
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,117
that guy was the real deal.

259
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,078
Why are you bringing that up right now?

260
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,789
Had I known
things would turn out like this,

261
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,625
I would've told you to marry him
when you had the chance.

262
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,629
I feel like this is all my fault.

263
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,009
I had no idea that it had been
eating away at you like this.

264
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:06,473
I feel so stupid for liking the mere fact
that he was a doctor.

265
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:13,730
I feel sorry that you have
someone like me as your mother.

266
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,725
Su-in, eat as much pork belly as you want.

267
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,018
-Okay.
-Okay.

268
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,437
Is today a special day?
What are we eating out for?

269
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,148
I took care of Eun-pyo's kids
when she had a lecture.

270
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,108
So she gave me some spending money.

271
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,986
Why did you accept the money?
She's family.

272
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,863
You could've just done it for her.

273
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,531
My goodness.

274
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,700
Do you think you can
take care of three kids at once?

275
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,160
Hey, stop that.

276
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,329
Taking care of kids is really hard.

277
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,332
So are you happy then?

278
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,710
Are you happy to eat
pork belly with that money?

279
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,338
Eat lots, okay?

280
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:29,806
How much did you get?

281
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,810
That's a secret.
How could I reveal something like that?

282
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,687
It's my money.

283
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,022
Goodness.

284
00:22:55,791 --> 00:23:01,588
MR. LEE

285
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,892
-Since we all stuffed ourselves tonight,
-Yes?

286
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:17,896
let's do just two pages
of your workbook before you go to bed.

287
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,189
Okay then.

288
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,982
Wow!

289
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,234
Okay.

290
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,069
INCOMING CALL

291
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,658
Hello?

292
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,162
Are you busy?

293
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,832
What is it?

294
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,226
What happened?

295
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,228
Did you try talking to him?

296
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,482
You have to stop your husband, okay?

297
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,652
Unlike before, they'll send him
straight to jail if he gets caught.

298
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,658
Why are you worried about him?

299
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,618
What?

300
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,622
You could think of it as a good thing.

301
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,958
Can't you?

302
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,462
What kind of nonsense is that?

303
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,092
If he goes to jail,
you'll be the one who suffers the most.

304
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,393
I'm getting a divorce.

305
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:45,567
So he and I have nothing to do
with each other.

306
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,154
Whether or not he gets caught

307
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,656
is not my business.

308
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,082
Have you made up your mind?

309
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,837
Yes.

310
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,890
Did I do the right thing?

311
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,811
I guess.

312
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,734
Then will you run away with me?

313
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,822
You're the one who told me to let you know

314
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,450
if I was ever going through
something difficult.

315
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,414
Things have never been
more difficult for me.

316
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,677
Chun-hui…

317
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,514
Chun-hui, I…

318
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,278
I'm only kidding.

319
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,035
It's late. You should head back.

320
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:48,982
OHSOLSOL KINDERGARTEN

321
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,817
Just sprinkle a little bit…

322
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,027
Dong-ju.

323
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,821
This is a present.

324
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,781
Thank you.

325
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,783
-Bye.
-Bye.

326
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:06,374
It's shiny and even
the stars are sparkly too.

327
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,376
Hang on.

328
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,629
My bouncy ball…

329
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,186
Henry's mom?

330
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,773
Hey, cute little boy.

331
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,608
You should be careful.

332
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:40,158
Ma'am, I told my mom
that I wanted to see Henry today.

333
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,869
How come you didn't come with him today?

334
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,537
I wonder what you're saying to me.

335
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,582
I'm sorry,
but I'm not very good at Korean.

336
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,802
Hello, Dong-seok's mom.

337
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,845
-Hello.
-Hello.

338
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:04,974
Mom!

339
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:08,603
Hey, Dong-ju. Mommy will be right there!

340
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:12,107
One of my friends gave me a present today!

341
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,238
But Mom,

342
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,991
the person that gave me this is my friend.

343
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:26,955
And I even know their name!

344
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,916
Mom, look at my bouncy ball!

345
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,918
Mom!

346
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,338
Mom! Why aren't you looking?

347
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:39,259
-All right, Dong-ju, I'll be right there.
-But Mom,

348
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,137
my friend gave this to me

349
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,890
and if I hold it up
to the light, it gets all sparkly.

350
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,601
Mom!

351
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,814
Why would you go there?

352
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,733
Why do you keep
putting me in a difficult spot?

353
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,319
I was just curious about
what kind of neighborhood you lived in.

354
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,405
Is it that upsetting?

355
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,826
It's where I used to live with my wife.

356
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,870
I have my reasons
for not sharing that with you.

357
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,331
Why is it so difficult for you
to talk about yourself?

358
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,125
You won't show me Henry.

359
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,793
You won't talk about your wife

360
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,420
or about anything that happened
during the 20 years we were apart.

361
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,798
Why aren't you telling me anything?

362
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:24,012
I'm going to show you Henry and tell you
everything when the time is right.

363
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,599
Are you sure you're not
with your wife anymore?

364
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,353
Why does it feel like
you're hiding something from me?

365
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,107
You're the one who left me.

366
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,401
All you left was a single letter!

367
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,445
I looked for you all across Europe!

368
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,573
Spain, Italy, and even Lithuania!

369
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,700
I searched everywhere.

370
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,118
But you…

371
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,581
You would never have come looking for me
if our parents hadn't passed away.

372
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,750
And you dare doubt me?

373
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,294
What more do I have to prove to you?

374
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,263
I'm sorry.

375
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,517
Back then…

376
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:58,398
I thought I had to disappear
for you to live a good life.

377
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:04,320
And it wasn't just you.
I thought that way about everyone.

378
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,740
Mom said…

379
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,370
that I was like a rotten apple
when I was a child.

380
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,499
That if anyone else got close,
I'd turn them rotten too.

381
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,088
I think that's what I was afraid of.

382
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:29,512
I was afraid that I'd ruin
your happy family.

383
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,862
Mom, what's a garçon?

384
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,324
That's the language of the country
Henry is going to, right?

385
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,077
Why are you interested in that word
all of a sudden, Dong-ju?

386
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,164
I was bouncing my bouncy ball
and it bounced all the way…

387
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,876
The water got in my eyes.

388
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,879
It's okay. We just need to rinse it out.

389
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,505
The water!

390
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,548
You're okay.

391
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:09,218
I don't like the water!

392
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,014
SEO JIN-HA

393
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,105
I admire your friendship

394
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:25,860
but remember that your actions
could hurt an innocent man.

395
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,946
You'd be making life hell for people

396
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,822
who are still here to protect
a dead woman's dignity.

397
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,700
Just don't do anything.

398
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,026
Making something like this
isn't going to be easy.

399
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,902
-We can make it ourselves?
-Yes, we can.

400
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,696
There are great guidelines online.

401
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,990
Also, the more you use it,
the cleaner the water gets.

402
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,701
-That's right.
-You can rent one at the district office…

403
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,286
That's so true.

404
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,705
-I heard it was quite competitive.
-That's exactly--

405
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,624
What is it? Is everything okay?

406
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,709
Oh…

407
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,420
It's…

408
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,005
It's just a spam message.…

409
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,132
There are so many
spam messages these days.

410
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,009
-Seriously, it's so annoying.
-It's a problem.

411
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,444
MY JEANNE HÉBUTERNE

412
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,113
NOW LET'S FINISH OUR FIERCE
AND BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY

413
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,079
Ms. Nam brought this photo to me.

414
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,666
I believe the situation is very different
from the one you described.

415
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,171
1-3 JUNG DONG-SEOK'S MOTHER

416
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,257
I want you to personally
set the record straight.

417
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:58,429
If not, I'll let Jin-ha's family
know the truth.

418
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,370
Yeong-mi, please calm down!

419
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:26,207
-Please calm down, Yeong-mi!
-How could you do this to me?

420
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,126
I worked so hard to protect my pride.

421
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,253
How can you take
everything down in one fell swoop?

422
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,506
Do you think
you had me fooled this entire time?

423
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,383
I knew about everything.

424
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,176
Your infidelity.

425
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,470
Your hypocrisy.

426
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,430
Your false pretenses.

427
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,727
How are you going to
take responsibility now?

428
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,688
I'll…

429
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,567
-I'll do everything I can…
-How?

430
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,652
What could you possibly do?

431
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,446
We're done for!

432
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,783
I understand

433
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,078
that your feelings may have been hurt.

434
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,332
I said some things
that I didn't necessarily have to say.

435
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,877
I wanted to apologize to you for that.

436
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,755
I'm sorry.

437
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,258
There's nothing
you need to apologize to me for.

438
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,011
What you said is true after all.

439
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,728
I'm really sorry, but could you…

440
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,773
just pretend like this never happened?

441
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,192
My husband has been through
so much suffering.

442
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,569
He's been working on
his screenplay for eight years

443
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,154
and it just started to work out.

444
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,324
I think all the stress
caused him to behave like that.

445
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,243
Takeitslow, I mean…

446
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,955
Eun-pyo, artists have that side to them.

447
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,790
They can be peculiar and bizarre.

448
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,377
But what can I do?
For better or for worse, we're family.

449
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,546
More than anything else,
isn't it the kids that have it the worst?

450
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,632
Jul-pin and Dong-seok are friends.

451
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,344
I know how you care about your friend but…

452
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,388
That's not why I'm doing this.

453
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:50,977
I'm only doing it

454
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:55,273
because it feels like
it's the only choice I have.

455
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:00,152
It's not as though I don't understand you.

456
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,032
But try and see things
from my perspective.

457
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,287
I want to clear the name

458
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,206
of the deceased.

459
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,938
-Is this the right one?
-Yes.

460
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,940
-All right, let's see.
-How does this look?

461
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,609
-Wow…
-Stop that.

462
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,279
Quiet down, will you?

463
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,907
We talked about going
with the shorter one.

464
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,908
Give me that.

465
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,869
-Which one was it?
-Here.

466
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,455
This one right here, okay?

467
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,543
-This is nice.
-Please check the colors.

468
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,878
Director Oh.

469
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,964
Prepare yourself
for the worst-case scenario.

470
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,300
Director Oh!

471
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,010
-What?
-How does this one look?

472
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,764
Can you put the glasses on him too?

473
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,807
-Hey, go help him with that.
-Yes, sir.

474
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,355
Hey, Eun-pyo.

475
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,066
Are you busy?

476
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,570
Oh, I'm out right now.

477
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,530
What's up?

478
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,408
There's something
I want to discuss with you.

479
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,452
What is it?

480
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,664
It's not something I want to
talk about over the phone.

481
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,666
I see.

482
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,922
I actually have something
I want to tell you too.

483
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,134
Do you want to meet later tonight?

484
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,849
You earthling warriors,
this planet is now mine!

485
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:39,854
-Hey, Eun-pyo.
-Gosh.

486
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,814
You're going out to drink
pretty often these days.

487
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,609
Are you secretly seeing someone?

488
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,737
Please, I wish that were the case.

489
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,031
Feel free to meet
as many guys as you want.

490
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,118
It's not easy to find
a man as attractive as me.

491
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,954
-Bring it on, earthling monsters!
-Gosh…

492
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,833
-I'll be back.
-Here I come!

493
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,835
-Have fun.
-All right.

494
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,080
Hey, Chun-hui.

495
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,749
Yes, I see the real estate office.

496
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,960
Is it the pub right after I pass it?

497
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,963
Head into the alley?

498
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,297
All right.

499
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,996
You better shut up
if you don't want me to kill you.

500
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,750
-We're going for another round, right?
-No!

501
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,712
-Thank you for the drinks.
-Let's go for the second round.

502
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,338
-No, I can't.
-Come on!

503
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,465
-Let's get going.
-Come here.

504
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,678
There's just something
I really need to know.

505
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,599
Why does everyone
seem to be out to get me?

506
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,351
You're just like everyone else,
aren't you?

507
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,395
That's why I hate people like you.

508
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,231
I want to rip your mouth
and kill every last one of you.

509
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,357
Do you understand me?

510
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,661
Chun-hui!

511
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,788
Eun-pyo, what's going on?

512
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,083
There was a mugger…

513
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,878
Are you okay?

514
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,221
SANGWE POLICE STATION

515
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,682
Eun-pyo, are you okay?

516
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,933
What happened?

517
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,895
-Did you see his face?
-No.

518
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,813
Then do you remember his voice?

519
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,899
No.

520
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,486
Think about it carefully.
Is there anything you can remember?

521
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,864
I can't think of anything right now.

522
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,824
All right. Eun-pyo, just calm down first.

523
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,495
Thank you for your hard work.
I'm Eun-pyo's guardian.

524
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,580
Could I take a look
at the statement, please?

525
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,666
Thank you.

526
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,507
Are you okay?

527
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,010
Breathe slowly.

528
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,092
Louis?

529
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,150
LOUIS BENUEL

530
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,330
LOUIS BENUEL

531

534
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:55,854
2019 BALOISE ART PRIZE WINNER SEO JIN-HA.
FALLS TO HER DEATH AT HOME

535
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,899
Eun-pyo, I'm coming in.

536
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,488
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

537
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:54,913
The world is such a scary place.
I don't even know how we get by.

538
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,666
Have some of this.

539
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,335
I bet you're not feeling well
because you were so scared.

540
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,628
Thanks.

541
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:05,132
It wasn't easy taking care
of the kids all of a sudden, was it?

542
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,385
Don't worry about it and just eat up.

543
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,848
Goodness.

544
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:16,143
But why did you walk into
such a dark alley in the first place?

545
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,563
I was on my way to see someone.

546
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:20,689
Who?

547
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,484
An old university friend.

548
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,197
Then you should've met up
in a well-lit place.

549
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,241
Why did you meet in such a dark place?

550
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,326
I know, right?

551
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,828
You really didn't see
anyone following you?

552
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,413
Are you sure it wasn't someone you know?

553
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,209
I don't know.

554
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:46,340
Part of me feels like it was just
some drunk guy going crazy.

555
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,177
Eun-pyo.

556
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,432
Remember that criminal
you told me about who followed

557
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,725
you and Jae-ung around?

558
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,352
Are you sure it's not him?

559
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,690
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

560
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,734
Also…

561
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,696
Don't let the kids go
to the playground by themselves.

562
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,532
Goodness, don't worry. Get going.

563
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,620
Guys, aren't you going to say
bye to your mom? Say bye.

564
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,080
Bye.

565
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,665
All right. I'll be back.

566
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,781
Mr. Oh Geon-u.

567
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,991
Mr. Oh Geon-u?

568
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,772
Ms. Lee Eun-pyo?

569
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,445
I heard everything from Yeong-mi.

570
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,739
I think there's been
a major misunderstanding.

571
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,032
To be honest, Ms. Seo and I…

572
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,827
were in love with each other.

573
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,122
That photo was a play
for only the two of us.

574
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,290
But…

575
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:48,378
I don't understand why you're doing this
to me when you know nothing about us.

576
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,091
Why do you seem to be out to get me?

577
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,682
That pervert.

578
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,392
That wasn't any kind of "play."

579
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,353
And now you're trying to make Jin-ha
responsible for everything?

580
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,688
What a vile man.

581
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,693
Why does everyone
seem to be out to get me?

582
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,279
You're just like everyone else,
aren't you?

583
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,281
That's why I hate people like you.

584
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,750
Why do you seem to be out to get me?

585
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,409
Jae-ung.

586
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,161
I think

587
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,455
I figured out who it was.

588
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,835
Excuse me.

589
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,129
Is Mr. Oh Geon-u around?

590
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,215
Sorry? Director Oh
is in the middle of a discussion.

591
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,723
Mr. Oh Geon-u?

592
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,891
Who…

593
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,894
We've met before, haven't we?

594
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,688
I'm from the major crimes unit
of Jeong Jin Police Station.

595
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:15,483
Please cooperate with our investigation of
the recent assault and threatening case.

596
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,402
Who did that?

597
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,446
Me?

598
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,005
Mr. Oh Geon-u.

599
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,549
This is you, right?

600
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,551
Yes.

601
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,469
And?

602
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,554
What were you doing there?

603
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,850
After having drinks with the staff,

604
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,311
I went to look
for a place to drink by myself.

605
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,688
But I couldn't one find
so I left right away.

606
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,398
Is there something wrong with that?

607
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,197
Then what's this?

608
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,281
Wow.

609
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,575
Where did you get this?

610
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,161
Exactly.

611
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,914
Where could this have come from?

612
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,540
Well…

613
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,380
I think I bumped into someone there.

614
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:22,133
Wait. I was pretty drunk.
Did I bump into someone?

615
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,718
Or did I fall?

616
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,012
I looked around for it,
but it was too dark to see anything.

617
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,640
So I just went home…

618
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,065
But, detectives.

619
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,738
Are you even aware of
what kind of work I do?

620
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,659
I think it's because of this photo.

621
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,078
I told him to reveal the truth.

622
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,747
In the beginning…

623
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,251
he kept on claiming

624
00:54:56,918 --> 00:55:00,588
that Jin-ha was the one who sent him
this photo of her own accord.

625
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,258
That she was his stalker.

626
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,224
I'm a director.

627
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:12,517
A movie director.

628
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,939
I think you're being a bit rude to someone
who might do big things for the country.

629
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:23,111
I'm going to keep my mouth shut
until my lawyer gets here.

630
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,907
-What the…
-Stay still.

631
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,290
Why are you lying, you punk?

632
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,333
You threatened my wife, punk!

633
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,086
-Let him go!
-Why the hell are you laughing?

634
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,005
Are cops allowed to
punch innocent citizens?

635
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,131
Just step outside!

636
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,675
-Why?
-Jeez, calm down.

637
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,926
What did I do?

638
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,889
Damn it.

639
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,100
We'll go in.

640
00:55:55,852 --> 00:56:02,859
INTERROGATION ROOM

641
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,822
Detective Jung.

642
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,325
You have to come see this.

643
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,452
-What is it?
-This way.

644
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,665
What is this?

645
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,042
Is it deepfake?

646
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,043
Yes, sir.

647
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,921
Someone did a very good job
of putting these two together.

648
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,131
It's obvious when you
see it on a big screen,

649
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,842
but on a cellphone screen,
it looks pretty darn convincing.

650
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,637
Why would he do something like this?
That psycho.

651
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:40,522
Could you try and explain
this one too, Mr. Artist?

652
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,031
What is this?

653
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,616
"What is this?"

654
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,411
Then…

655
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,748
Do you not know
anything about this either?

656
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,292
We found this at Seo Jin-ha's house!

657
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:16,224
Hey, do you even know what art is?

658
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:20,603
All of this is part of
the process of artistic creation.

659
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:25,567
She and I communicated with our souls.
Do you know what that means?

660
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,446
Do you know how difficult it is
to have to walk that path?

661
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,240
How can you judge me
when you don't know anything?

662
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,576
Is it okay to keep me locked up
just because you're cops?

663
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,785
Let go of me!

664
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,413
-Let go of me! Call my lawyer!
-Stay still.

665
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,790
How can you lock me up
like this without a warrant?

666
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,751
Mr. Oh Geon-u is being investigated
for assault and threatening a woman.

667
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,005
And he's also being investigated
for violating the Cyber Ethics act.

668
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:50,675
If you'd like to come and see him,
you can call the Jeong Jin Police Station.

669
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:52,635
Hello?

670
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:08,818
JEONG JIN POLICE STATION

671
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,369
It was photoshopped?

672
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,538
I think he was a stalker.

673
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,374
As soon as Ms. Seo started
distancing herself from him,

674
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,543
he was trying to get back at her.

675
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:30,590
So Ms. Seo was the victim
of a terribly heinous crime.

676
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,051
Then…

677
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,137
could Jin-ha have killed herself

678
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,307
because of that?

679
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,391
I'm not sure.

680
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:43,186
We'll have to look into it more.

681
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,151
You did a good job.

682
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:53,530
Thanks to you,
Ms. Seo's name has been cleared.

683
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,352
Did you…

684
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,772
feel like you were wronged?

685
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,847
Why did you do it?

686
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,644
Why did you do it?

687
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:08,354
Tell me.

688
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,399
You can't do things like that.

689
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,860
You're an intellectual.

690
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,280
You're an intellectual at the very least.

691
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,698
I'm tired of this.

692
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:21,868
Sick and tired.

693
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,290
I told you to stop doing that.

694
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,168
To stop playing
the part of an intellectual.

695
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,880
Yeong-mi.

696
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,008
You didn't marry me
because you truly loved me.

697
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:43,389
All you wanted was to become
the wife of a famous director.

698
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,933
That's why all you ever said to me was,

699
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,436
"You're a genius
so you're going to make it."

700
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:50,813
"You're an artist so I believe in you."

701
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,525
It felt insanely suffocating.

702
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,985
So is that your excuse…

703
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,613
as to why you did such vile things?

704
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:01,741
So what?

705
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,828
Is all of it my fault?

706
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,091
Do you think I would've gone that far…

707
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,511
if you were even a tiny bit more pretty?

708
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,767
You bastard!

709
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,229
Watch your damn mouth!

710
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:34,190
-You fucker!
-Ma'am, calm down.

711
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,235
I'm not going to let you
get away with this you bastard.

712
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:38,611
Just wait until you get out!

713
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,364
You think someone like you
is ever going to make a movie?

714
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,991
That might be the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

715
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,201
Bastard.

716
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:55,563
YU-BIN'S MOM

717
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:02,320
The number you have dialed
is not available. Please leave a message.

718
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,363
You'll be charged after the beep.

719
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,377
Chun-hui, is everything okay?

720
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,047
Why aren't you picking up your phone?

721
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,991
CHUN-HUI, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
WHY AREN'T YOU PICKING UP YOUR PHONE?

722
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:58,709
YU-BIN'S MOM

723
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,757
The number you have dialed
is not available. Please leave a message.

724
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,634
You'll be charged after the beep.

725
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,187
Hello.

726
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,403
Did Chun-hui and the kids go somewhere?

727
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:27,488
I can't seem to get in contact with her.

728
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,575
They went on a trip.

729
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:57,768
INCOMING CALL

730
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,070
Eun-pyo.

731
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:09,864
Chun-hui.

732
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,909
Why is it so hard to get a hold of you?

733
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,911
Do you know how worried I was?

734
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,289
Where are you?

735
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:22,460
Yu-bin's father told me
that you went on a trip.

736
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:29,675
Eun-pyo, we actually moved out.

737
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,970
I'm getting a divorce from my husband.

738
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,770
I left without telling him
because it's going to be a tough battle.

739
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,315
I even turned off my phone
because he might look around for me.

740
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:52,114
I wanted to tell you about it that day
but because of what had happened to you,

741
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,577
I never got a chance to tell you.

742
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,456
Why…

743
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:05,211
Why are you getting divorced
all of a sudden?

744
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:11,425
Was it that difficult for you?

745
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:14,428
No…

746
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:19,308
I just want to be happy.

747
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:29,151
I was going to
tell you everything that day,

748
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,779
but then things happened.

749
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:48,129
I'm so sorry.

750
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:52,508
I had no idea
you were having such a hard time.

751
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:55,886
All I did was complain every day.

752
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,388
No, it's okay.

753
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:02,935
I'm sorry I had to leave so abruptly.

754
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,898
I'm thankful for everything
you did for me.

755
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,528
Eun-pyo.

756
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,573
I wish you a happy life.

757
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:20,619
Let's live a happy life no matter what.

758
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:27,728
I had no idea that he was this terrible.

759
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:32,274
He deceived me and abused my children.

760
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,901
Hey, where have you been hiding?

761
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:36,278
We'll be done for good
if we get more involved.

762
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,281
The guy living in front of
our house is a policeman.

763
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,659
Don't get involved
with her or her husband.

764
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:44,036
Don't ever forget
that you are Su-in's father.

765
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,206
Did she know about me?

766
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,962
I'll come back and do my time.

767
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:56,132
I'll leave my kids there and come back.
Please help me until then, Eun-pyo.

768
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:00,928
Chun-hui, I think
the police have noticed it.

769
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,645
