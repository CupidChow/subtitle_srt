1
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,322
I'll go now.

2
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,343
Hey…

3
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:40,850
Do you mind not telling Jin-ha
that I'm writing a book?

4
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,480
Okay.

5
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,943
EPISODE 5
AN ILL-FATED MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN

6
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,947
-It might hurt a little.
-Okay.

7
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,288
Su-in's father is going to
break his back to support all that.

8
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,541
What a pitiful life.

9
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,588
Man-su, did word used to go around
that you don't earn much?

10
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,632
-What are you talking about?
-It's just…

11
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,219
I talked to Byeon Chun-hui yesterday,

12
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,805
and when I said I'll give Su-in
the best education,

13
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,057
she was worried that you might
break your back because of that.

14
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,937
Who does she think she is
to worry about my family?

15
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,815
Is she looking down on us
because we're poor?

16
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,275
She was probably just joking.

17
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,069
But does she have to
upset me with a joke like that?

18
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,571
Honestly, the only thing

19
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,574
that makes her better than me
is that she's a doctor's wife.

20
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,744
I'm way prettier than her.

21
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,287
There you go.

22
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,166
Mommy has your bag.
Grab your bag for indoor shoes.

23
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,376
Say bye to Dad.

24
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,462
-I'm off to school.
-All right.

25
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,631
-Eat up and get going.
-All right, bye.

26
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,683
Seriously.

27
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,063
Something is going on
but you're just not telling me, right?

28
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,273
-Hey guys.
-Hey there.

29
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,942
-Hey.
-Hello.

30
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,027
What were you guys talking about?

31
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,905
We were talking about Dong-seok's mom
fitting into this neighborhood.

32
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,117
Of course. It's difficult to see
a Rube Goldberg award-winning mom.

33
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,953
Gosh, stop that.

34
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,873
So, are you preparing for the Geoseong
University School for Gifted Students?

35
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:09,791
Of course.

36
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,294
-A school for gifted students?
-Goodness, look at this lady.

37
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,922
The tests are coming up soon. Jeez.

38
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,550
Su-in will be teaming up
with Henry again, right?

39
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,681
I guess she'll probably call me soon.

40
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,017
But since she's against
the class for gifted children,

41
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,478
she might not have Henry
take the test at all.

42
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,982
But she entered the Rube Goldberg contest.

43
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,401
She would be really going
back and forth then.

44
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,279
Right. There's no way she would do that.

45
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,197
Exactly.

46
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,619
You already have someone in mind, right?

47
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,121
Yes.

48
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:53,251
Are you sure you haven't already
teamed up with Dong-seok's mom?

49
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,420
No, she didn't.

50
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,842
Then who's Dong-seok
going to team up with?

51
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,972
Come on, tell us.

52
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,308
Gosh, this is frustrating.

53
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,604
SEO JIN-HA

54
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,406
-Hello?
-Can you help me, Eun-pyo?

55
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,867
What's going on?

56
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,002
It feels like I'm watching something
deep in the abyss.

57
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,005
Just like how everyone

58
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,426
flows according to
whatever situation they're presented with.

59
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,513
Thank you.

60
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,725
Hearing you say that is so reassuring.

61
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,899
Now that the exhibition
is right around the corner,

62
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,860
I'm so anxious I can hardly bear it.

63
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,822
This exhibition is important to me.

64
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,160
It's my first domestic exhibition.
What if I get bad reviews?

65
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,662
Why would you be worried about that?

66
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,123
Your work is great enough.

67
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,292
Really?

68
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,170
Gosh, that's a relief.

69
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,258
Is this why you called me?

70
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,678
I'm sure you have
a lot of artists in your circle.

71
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,389
You should've asked an expert.

72
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,108
I wanted to ask you to look at it.

73
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,402
You have an eye for these things.

74
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,572
I've always felt

75
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,368
that you have such a sharp eye.

76
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,791
Right.

77
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:03,548
How about you write the introduction
for my exhibition, Eun-pyo?

78
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,426
How could I?

79
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,888
I'm sure a lot of famous critics
are waiting for the chance.

80
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,807
No.

81
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,809
I don't want that.

82
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,687
What I need is someone
who understands me completely.

83
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,273
And I think that person

84
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,400
is you.

85
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,902
No.

86
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,909
Why do you underestimate
your value like that?

87
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:36,080
You're more than qualified to do it.

88
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,964
Plus, it's a great opportunity.

89
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,842
There's going to be
a lot of media attention.

SEO JIN-HA WINS THE 2019 BALOISE ART PRIZE

91
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,767
SEO JIN-HA WAS SELECTED AS
THIS YEAR'S WINNER AT THE ART BASEL FAIR

92
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,775
Dong-seok's mom,
you should team up with my Min-ji.

93
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,569
I'll gather a lot of
good information for you.

94
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,614
Dong-seok's mom,
if you haven't picked a team yet,

95
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,491
what about Jae-bin?

96
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,285
THE THIRD KOREAN RECIPIENT OF THE AWARD

97
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,757
Dong-seok's mom.

98
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,343
What do you think about
Dong-seok, Yu-bin, and Henry

99
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,637
forming a team--

100
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,772
DAEGANG PREP ACADEMY
AVERAGE SCORE: 65.4, KIM YEONG-BIN: 64.5

101
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,654
-Okay?
-Okay.

102
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,239
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

103
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,514
Mom, do we have anything to drink?

104
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,812
How can you eat
when you got a test score like this?

105
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,900
Do you want to giggle with your friends
when you can't even get the average score?

106
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,006
This is the second time
you've scored lower than the average.

107
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,842
If this happens one more time,
you'll have to move to the regular class.

108
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,343
It was so hard to join the top class.

109
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,804
And now you're about to move down
because you're 0.9 points short.

110
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,639
How can you laugh at a time like this?

111
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,226
Why aren't you eating?

112
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,980
Are you going to just space out
in class with an empty stomach?

113
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,572
Hello?

114
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,371
Hello? Say something if you called.

115
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,206
Well…

116
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,335
Is this Ms. Byeon Chun-hui's…

117
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,672
Chun-hui, is that you?

118
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,469
Delete my number immediately.

119
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,396
Goodness.

120
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,356
My gosh.

121
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,482
Goodness.

122
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,651
It seems like
your leg's gotten worse, Mom.

123
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,902
No.

124
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,531
It's always like this.

125
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,746
You didn't have to bring all that stuff.

126
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,001
I know you like cucumber kimchi.

127
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,675
Eat this.

128
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:04,390
So who does Dong-seok take after
that makes him so smart?

129
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,810
Who could it be?
He probably takes after me.

130
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,188
What really irks me about those women

131
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:15,192
is that their attitudes did a complete
180 when they've been so dismissive.

132
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,360
Jeez.

133
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,489
Korean moms are all
about grades and studying.

134
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,992
You raise him the best you can.

135
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,243
You know,

136
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,998
it makes me happy
when I think of Dong-seok.

137
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,378
Gosh.

138
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,132
I told you to eat
the better-looking ones. Jeez.

139
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,802
It must be the delivery
from the grocery store.

140
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,184
Ta-da! This is a bribe.

141
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,770
I was so anxious, so I couldn't wait.

142
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,815
Ma'am!

143
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,358
Who…

144
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,612
Don't you remember me?

145
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,531
I'm Jin-ha.

146
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,742
I…

147
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,328
missed you so much.

148
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,627
You're so stubborn.

149
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,963
I said I'd treat you to something better.

150
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,173
No, it's fine.

151
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,135
Now that I'm older,
I don't care much for meat.

152
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,678
It's hard to digest.

153
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,266
That's not good.

154
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,561
The older you are, the more important
it is to get your protein.

155
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,942
By the way, do you remember?

156
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,070
When I had indigestion, you pricked
my thumb and made it go away.

157
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,239
I did that?

158
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,908
You did.

159
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,202
I was getting all dizzy and nauseous,

160
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,496
so you wrapped my finger with a string.

161
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,083
Then just like magic, I felt better.

162
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,254
Gosh, you remember the smallest things.

163
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,008
Now that I'm old,
I don't remember everything.

164
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,928
That's why I need to hurry up

165
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,389
and help you live a comfortable life.

166
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,643
Actually…

167
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:18,232
I won a pretty big award
in Switzerland last year.

168
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,026
It was even on the news and papers.

169
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,279
Did you?

170
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,363
Gosh.

171
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,740
That's incredible.

172
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,618
I'm having my first
domestic exhibition soon.

173
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,956
So I asked Eun-pyo to write
the introduction for my exhibition.

174
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,627
But she keeps backing out
saying she won't do it.

175
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,006
There are going to be
a lot of famous professors and critics,

176
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,550
so I'm sure it'll be helpful for her.

177
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,801
Really?

178
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,219
Here, have this.

179
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,140
Ma'am.

180
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,478
I'm so thankful
we got to see each other again.

181
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,607
You have no idea how upset I was

182
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,525
thinking I'd never see you again.

183
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,277
You were?

184
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,033
Make sure to stay in touch, okay?

185
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,747
I'll be going, then.

186
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,708
-Call me.
-Okay.

187
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,006
-Mom, do you remember her?
-Oh, right.

188
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,801
I'm not sure. I feel like I do,
but I don't at the same time.

189
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,221
Then why did you play along like that?

190
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:35,267
How could I act like I don't remember her
when she was being so friendly?

191
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,853
-It would've embarrassed her.
-Jeez.

192
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,147
But…

193
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,401
-Can't you do the thing?
-What?

194
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,946
The introduction thing,
for the exhibition…

195
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,658
There's no point in doing it.

196
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,607
Doesn't Kim Hee-seon have
such a pretty forehead?

197
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,485
It's not just her forehead that's pretty.
Everything's pretty.

198
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,656
I only look at people's foreheads
because mine is ugly.

199
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,033
Let's see…

200
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,704
What do my girls' foreheads look like?

201
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,001
Gosh, you take after me,
so you have an ugly one.

202
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,423
How does my little Jin-ha have
such a pretty forehead?

203
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,342
You could be an actress.

204
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,720
I'll be going.

205
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,263
See you around.

206
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,142
Ma'am.

207
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,019
Yes.

208
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,606
Can I lay my head on your lap?

209
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,109
Sure.

210
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,112
It's nothing. I waited for an hour

211
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,449
and I thought you were busy,
so I went to meet my friend.

212
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,451
I'm sorry.

213
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,662
Did something happen?

214
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,332
You smell like a mom, ma'am.

215
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,501
Are you sure it's not the smell of paint?

216
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,172
I don't think
I have the right to know that.

217
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,508
But please consider that
I treated you for dinner today.

218
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,095
-Sure.
-Bye, then.

219
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,018
Hurry up and eat it.

220
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,312
What's with the pineapples
at the crack of dawn?

221
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,148
The family that sells us rice
gave us four pieces yesterday.

222
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,109
I gave two to your brother
and there are only two left now.

223
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,861
Before your friend wakes up…

224
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,157
Hurry up and have some.

225
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,744
Gosh, Mom. Didn't you say
Jin-ha was prettier than I am?

226
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,957
Do you think someone else's kid
could ever compare to my own?

227
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,210
Come on.

228
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,548
-It's good.
-Is it?

229
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,259
Gosh, my little girl.

230
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,053
My baby.

231
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,053
CALLS

232
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,358
Hey, Jin-ha.

233
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,115
About that introduction…

234
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,661
Could I write it?

235
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,256
1,200,000 WON

236
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,632
How many zeros…

237
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,926
Jeez.

238
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,773
1,300,000 WON

239
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,859
This one's even more expensive.

240
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:06,955
Excuse me.

241
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,707
Yes.

242
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,921
Which one makes me look more intellectual
between these two?

243
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,637
Did you go somewhere?

244
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,430
-Yes.
-I see.

245
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,776
Eun-pyo.

246
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,195
-Eun-pyo.
-What?

247
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,697
-I bought something amazing today.
-I see.

248
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,284
Remember I told you about the truck
selling underwear in front of the station?

249
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,578
It turns out their stuff is real.

250
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,040
They hadn't shown up in a while
so I was a bit disappointed,

251
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,876
but I saw it in front of the station
when I got off my post today.

252
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,294
So, look. Take a look.

253
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,548
Adios boxers, three for 10,000 won.

254
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,301
Three for 10,000 won.

255
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,263
Isn't this incredible?
It's awesome, isn't it?

256
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,348
It sure is.

257
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,600
What's with the reaction?

258
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,979
I don't think you fully understand
just how lucky I am.

259
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,732
It costs 30,000 won per piece
if you go to a department store.

260
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,650
Jeez.

261
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,528
What's this?

262
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,657
I just got a new outfit.

263
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,908
Really?

264
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,243
Good job.

265
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,870
My wife did a good job.

266
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,789
If you dress up like this,

267
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,875
you'll look better than all the women
in this neighborhood.

268
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,168
It suits you.

269
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,754
Gosh, this is so nice. How much was this?

270
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,464
130,000 won?

271
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,925
Something as nice as this
only costs 130,000 won?

272
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,803
That's incredible.

273
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,557
How many zeros is that?

274
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,517
It's 1,300,000 won?

275
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,770
Am I not even allowed to buy a new outfit?

276
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,856
Eun-pyo, it's not that.

277
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,654
FIRST SOLO EXHIBITION IN KOREA

278
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,748
ECHOES OF THE HEART,
IN SEARCH OF THE WAVE OF THE ABYSS

279
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,708
WRITTEN BY: LEE EUN-PYO, PH.D. ART CRITIC

280
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,837
If you could please sign the guest log.

281
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,339
Yes.

282
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,094
LEE EUN-PYO

283
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,262
Oh, my.

284
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,598
You're the critic.

285
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,141
Yes.

286
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,324
Lee Eun-pyo!

287
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,035
You came.

288
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,495
Hello.

289
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,747
Gosh, how many years has it been?

290
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,832
You haven't changed a bit.

291
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,460
Please, I'm so much older now.

292
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,547
I saw that you wrote
the introduction for the exhibition.

293
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,426
Yes, Jin-ha wouldn't stop asking me to.

294
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,471
When did you two
become best friends again?

295
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,849
I guess there's something
about old classmates.

296
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,185
We can give each other
opportunities like this.

297
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,105
Jeez, I was worried for no reason.

298
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,860
I see everyone was over here.

299
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,655
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

300
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,785
-Congratulations, Jin-ha.
-Gosh, they're so pretty.

301
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,787
Thank you.

302
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,706
Since you have the flowers,
you should take a picture together.

303
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,624
Should we?

304
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,335
All right.

305
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,921
One, two, three.

306
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,924
Thank you.

307
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,093
Right, Eun-pyo.

308
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,846
There's someone
I want to introduce you to.

309
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,765
Excuse us. Let's go.

310
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,945
There he is.

311
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,324
Uncle! Let me introduce you to my friend.

312
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,913
This is Lee Eun-pyo. We studied together
at university and in France.

313
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,084
It's nice to see you again, Professor.

314
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,963
It's been a while.

315
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:27,966
Oh, my.

316
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,635
You two already know each other?

317
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:46,026
Goodness, I had no clue
that Eun-pyo was your student.

318
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,779
He and my dad have been like brothers

319
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:53,450
ever since they
studied abroad in France together.

320
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,163
He's like an uncle who adored me
ever since I was a little girl.

321
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,624
Oh, I see.

322
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,547
Now that I think about it,
the two of you have a lot in common.

323
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:12,093
I was with Eun-pyo in France too.

324
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,805
You have no idea how much
Eun-pyo looked after me back then.

325
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,476
I'm so grateful for her.

326
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,144
Is that so?

327
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,442
Since you're a supervising professor,

328
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:31,404
you must have introduced
the lectures that Eun-pyo gives.

329
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,448
Jin-ha.

330
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,036
I don't give any lectures right now.

331
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,454
Really?

332
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:44,542
Didn't you tell me
that you were giving lectures?

333
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,128
The thing is…

334
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,800
I quit due to some circumstances.

335
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,177
Circumstances?

336
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,429
What circumstances?

337
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:04,354
What could've possibly made you
quit being a professor?

338
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,732
You're really doing well for yourself,
aren't you?

339
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,153
You didn't tell her?

340
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,241
Yun-mi, you're currently lecturing, right?

341
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,867
Yes, of course.

342
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,035
Where?

343
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,120
Geoseong University.

344
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,372
It must be nice.

345
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,667
You must be reminded of the old days
whenever you go to work then.

346
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,003
I guess.

347
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,882
I'm most jealous of people

348
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,884
who get to lecture at their alma mater.

349
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,763
Says the Baloise Art Prize winner.

350
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,600
Winning a prize only lasts for a moment.

351
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,981
I want to give lectures
if I ever have the chance.

352
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,237
You're going to get back
into giving lectures, right?

353
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,830
Hey, we can ask
my uncle to do you a favor.

354
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:09,502
Uncle, please take good care of Eun-pyo.

355
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:13,089
Eun-pyo is a really…

356
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,092
special friend of mine.

357
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,192
I'm sorry.

358
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,877
Jin-ha.

359
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,046
Congratulations.

360
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,048
You're here.

361
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,859
TTEOKBOKKI

362
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,374
Darn it.

363
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,053
I shouldn't have bought this.

364
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,933
I shouldn't have bought this…

365
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,508
Breakfast is ready.

366
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,218
Okay.

367
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,723
Darn it.

368
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,266
Jeez, my head.

369
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,145
Jeez, my head.

370
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,230
I'm dying.

371
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,484
STAR BY STAR, NOVEL BY SHEENA WILKINSON

372
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:40,987
Goodness.

373
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,825
Stop drinking so much.

374
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:46,993
READING LIST FOR YEONG-BIN AND YU-BIN

375
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,581
And stop spending all your money
on those bar girls.

376
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,374
It's like you're trying
to pour water into a broken vase.

377
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,752
If I can't have a little fun,
what's the point in living?

378
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,671
And it's not like I pay for my drinks.

379
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,215
The pharmaceutical companies pay for it.

380
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,761
Right.

381
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,013
You know that punk, Lee Man-su.

382
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,140
Jeez, that stupid prick.

383
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:14,229
I stroked his ego a bit
and he fell right into my hands.

384
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,316
I asked him if he could
hook me up with some etomidate

385
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,151
and he started sweating bullets.

386
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:24,405
If things turn out well,
he could be a safe, new source.

387
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,407
Don't you think so?

388
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,785
Why did you come all the way here?

389
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,501
-Do you have a favor to--
-Don't meet my husband.

390
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,381
Don't meet him even if he calls you.

391
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:28,177
Don't get involved in my life in any way.

392
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,319
Why…

393
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,655
Why do you still live your life
getting used by others?

394
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,366
Tell me.

395
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,160
I'm…

396
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,997
I'm just worried about you.

397
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,291
Why would you need to worry about that?

398
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,168
Who do you think you are?

399
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,505
Because you're very reckless.

400
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,013
You're crazy.

401
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,489
Are you kidding me right now?
Do I seem like a joke to you?

402
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,242
-No.
-Then why do you ignore what I say?

403
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,787
Didn't I tell you
to memorize all of this by today?

404
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,706
-I'm sorry.
-Does being sorry solve everything?

405
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,291
Answer me!

406
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,586
It's a fatal accident if the
anesthesiologist unit mixes up the drugs!

407
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,963
Do you not know that?

408
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,673
Yes?

409
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,593
Ms. Song, I need to talk to you
about something.

410
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,720
-Is it urgent?
-Yes, I just need a moment.

411
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,057
I'll be back to check on this.

412
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,897
Get some rest.

413
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,197
Bye, Mom.

414
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,575
Bye. I love you, Dong-ju. Have a good day.

415
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,368
Hey, Dong-ju.

416
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,121
Take your shoes off.

417
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,497
And here.

418
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,916
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye.

419
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,127
-Did you have breakfast, Dong-ju?
-Yes.

420
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,295
What did you eat?

421
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,175
Eun-pyo.

422
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,318
I'm sorry about the other day.

423
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,488
I had no idea
you quit working at the school…

424
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,741
and blabbed in front of everyone.

425
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,285
But…

426
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:43,039
I asked my uncle to see
if you could get your spot back.

427
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,624
No, don't do that.

428
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,586
And from now on,
don't ever contact me again.

429
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,214
Why are you being like this?

430
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,925
I always thought I was the weird one.

431
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,677
That it was my inferiority complex.

432
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,263
But I knew for sure at the exhibition.

433
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,932
You don't like me.

434
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,603
And yet you say I'm special to you.

435
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,355
Why do you do that?

436
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,733
Do you have some sort of mental condition?

437
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:18,783
You always behaved like this
back in middle school and university.

438
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,535
You remember Kim Tae-hun, right?

439
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,412
When I told you
that I had feelings for Kim Tae-hun,

440
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,915
you started going out
with him the next day.

441
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:29,335
And I couldn't do my exchange year
because you applied.

442
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,670
Even for art competitions.

443
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,339
You always joined the ones I did
just to screw me over.

444
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,257
And also Louis--

445
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,348
I don't care
if you say it's self-accusation

446
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,308
or my inferiority complex.

447
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,563
Either way, I don't want to
get involved with you anymore.

448
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,566
If we run into each other,
just pretend you don't know me.

449
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,173
Ma'am.

450
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,383
A guest is here to see you.

451
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,433
I'll be heading home now.

452
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,604
Sure, go ahead.

453
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:31,731
Yes.

454
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,376
Jin-ha.

455
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,755
Did you forget you were
supposed to meet me today?

456
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,549
I came because I was worried as your mom.

457
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,093
"Mom"?

458
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,513
Who's mom are you?

459
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,141
My mom died.

460
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,563
Don't you remember?

461
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,108
How could you forget that, Su-hyeon?

462
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,402
You were there

463
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:22,949
the day my mom died.

464
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,745
You were happy that my mom died,
weren't you?

465
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,414
That's why

466
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,000
you went on a trip with my dad

467
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,003
when it wasn't even
a month since she died.

468
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:51,811
But then again,
I don't have any right to say that.

469
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,693
Just leave.

470
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,195
I think I was rushing things.

471
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,074
I still…

472
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,078
don't want to look at…

473
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,039
your face.

474
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,383
Stop drinking.

475
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,762
Why do you care whether or not I drink?

476
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,226
What's the point of us…

477
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,897
trying to do this now?

478
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,175
Don't come here anymore.

479
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,054
Think of it as an ill-fated relationship.

480
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,434
And stop trying…

481
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,645
to be a part of my life.

482
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,019
Jin-ha.

483
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,468
-Hey, let's go together!
-I'm going to go up first.

484
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,011
I want to go up too.

485
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,347
Come up quickly.

486
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,642
Mom!

487
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,561
-I came all the way up here!
-Mom.

488
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,314
-Yes.
-Mom, I came up here too!

489
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,359
Dong-seok's mom!

490
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,903
Dong-seok's mom!

491
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,112
Dong-seok's mom.

492
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,781
-Isn't it fun?
-I'm going first.

493
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,201
Hello.

494
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,786
-Hello.
-Hey.

495
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,956
I'm so relieved to find you here.

496
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,291
What's going on, Ms. Nam?

497
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,752
I'm sorry,

498
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,296
but something very urgent came up.

499
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,507
Could you look after Henry for the night?

500
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:36,136
-For the night?
-Something urgent came up at home.

501
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,515
I'm sorry. Please look after him for me.

502
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,016
All right.

503
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,019
Let's go on the seesaw.

504
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,452
Gosh, why are neither of them picking up?

505
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,746
-The number you have dialed is…
-Seriously…

506
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:07,376
Henry, stop crying.

507
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,462
Then I'll sing you a lullaby, okay?

508
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,966
I can't sleep without Tory.

509
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,430
Tory is supposed to protect me.

510
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,146
Just grab Tory
and come right back out, okay?

511
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,565
Guys! Where do you think you're going?

512
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,917
Dong-seok and Dong-ju,

513
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,462
you better come out before I count to ten.

514
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,298
One…

515
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,216
two…

516
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,387
Dong-ju.

517
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,057
Where are you?

518
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,377
Where did they go?

519
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,290
I'll be discharging.

520
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,084
I absolutely hate…

521
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,130
the smell of hospitals.

522
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,138
Dong-ju…

523
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,507
Would you like a drink?

524
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,634
No, thank you.

525
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,889
Ms. Nam said she had an emergency

526
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,643
and neither of you
was picking up your phone.

527
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,729
Sorry. It ran out of battery.

528
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,654
Where's Jin-ha?

529
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,035
I'm sorry I couldn't finish the job.

530
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,038
And I'm sorry
for not telling you in person.

531
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,874
It's okay.

532
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,960
But what was the reason?

533
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,338
Did I make you feel uncomfortable?

534
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:27,135
I just didn't want there
to be any misunderstandings.

535
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,558
But why did you want to
keep this a secret from Jin-ha?

536
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,144
Is there a problem?

537
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,855
No, it's just…

538
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:44,194
Telling her about it
would just complicate things.

539
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:50,450
Sometimes there are problems
that need to be talked about.

540
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,206
What kind of problems?

541
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,126
For example,

542
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,295
stuff like this.

543
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,634
Why did you…

544
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,804
go to Jin-ha back then?

545
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,564
I never asked you back then,

546
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:25,569
and my curiosity
tormented me for a long time.

547
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:29,156
Even though it might not matter now,

548
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,412
I want to know why you left me

549
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,788
for Jin-ha back then.

550
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,583
Was there…

551
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,463
something about me
that wasn't good enough?

552
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,765
Why…

553
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,727
are you here?

554
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,813
Ms. Nam suddenly…

555
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,318
Louis will tell you the details.

556
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,487
-I'll take you home.
-No.

557
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,405
Stay right where you are.

558
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,368
If you take another step…

559
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,665
I'm going to jump off the building.

560
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,308
-Mom, what about Henry?
-What?

561
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:41,770
Are we not having a sleepover with Henry?

562
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,979
No.

563
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,949
Why are you acting like this?

564
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,326
How could you do this to me?

565
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,453
-It's a misunderstanding.
-What misunderstanding?

566
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,331
I finally understand everything now.

567
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,626
It started from that moment.

568
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,504
From the moment she moved here,

569
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:10,674
you became colder
and started to avoid me more.

570
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,802
You!

571
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,639
You can't forget Eun-pyo.

572
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,101
You sneak out to the study every night

573
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,604
and look through old photos and reminisce.

574
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,857
You don't think I know that?

575
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,532
Why did you come to me
if you were going to be like this?

576
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,159
You should've said no.

577
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,201
Stop it.

578
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,079
-You're going to wake Henry.
-See?

579
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,457
Even in this very moment,

580
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,834
all you care about is the child
and you can't see my pain.

581
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,753
Do you think you and Henry are the same?

582
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,088
What's different?

583
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,091
What's different? Tell me!

584
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,302
This is why I don't want to live with you!

585
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,555
You only ever think about yourself!

586
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:02,309
You think you have it the worst
and all you do is feel sorry for yourself.

587
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,479
Do you think there was even a single day
that I was happy living with you?

588
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,106
So?

589
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:09,816
So what?

590
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,194
You're going to leave me and run away?

591
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:14,946
You bastard.

592
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:19,910
You think I don't know that you're
trying to run away from me with Henry?

593
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,578
You think I don't know that?

594
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,040
Let go!

595
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,466
Where are you going?

596
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,220
I'm not done talking yet.
Where do you think you're going?

597
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,085
You can't get me.

598
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,551
Mom, I did it!

599
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,970
Get down! I'm going to try too!

600
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,222
I said get down!

601
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,933
Dong-seok, get down. It's dangerous.

602
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,520
I told you guys to go to bed.

603
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,313
Try climbing up!

604
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,276
Help me, Dong-seok.

605
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,528
Here I go!

606
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,697
SEO JIN-HA

607
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,366
All right, I'm letting go!

608
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,535
I'm going to try climbing!

609
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,288
You're great at this!

610
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,581
Hello?

611
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,499
Did you have fun today?

612
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,462
You sly bitch.

613
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:58,091
You're the one who shouldn't
covet what's not yours.

614
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,511
Do you think you still have the right

615
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,764
to call me a sly, wicked bitch?

616
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,226
Acting like you're so smart

617
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,688
when all you do is covet what other
people have. You're disgusting!

618
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,232
Don't treat me like I'm the same as you.

619
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,692
What?

620
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,193
It was mine from the beginning.

621
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,279
You're the one who took it away from me!

622
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,324
You knew that I'd give up
because of my pride, so you lied.

623
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,867
You think I don't know that?

624
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,744
Mom, look at this!

625
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:26,912
You…

626
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,165
slept with Louis, didn't you?

627
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,208
What?

628
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,168
Mom!

629
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,628
You're really insane, aren't you?

630
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,380
You slept with Louis! Right?

631
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,507
You crazy bitch! Stop talking nonsense!

632
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,759
Mom!

633
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,427
Mom!

634
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,263
-Dong-seok!
-Dong-ju!

635
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,683
-Mommy's sorry. I didn't see it.
-It hurts.

636
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,727
Just hang in there.

637
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:54,606
-Mom, what are we going to do?
-Mom, it really hurts.

638
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:57,359
Dong-ju, just hang in there
a bit more, okay?

639
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:00,362
-Just hold on. It's okay.
-Mom.

640
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,821
Excuse me, we need to pass!

641
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,626
Hey, Dong-seok's mom.

642
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,796
Chun-hui, sorry for calling so late.

643
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:21,007
It's fine, I was up. What's going on?

644
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,844
I'm sorry to ask this,

645
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:28,723
but you said Yu-bin's father
works at Eulju Hospital, right?

646
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,993
Thank you so much for yesterday.

647
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,121
I know it must've been a hassle…

648
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:55,125
but you were the only person
I could think of.

649
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,338
You did the right thing.

650
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,931
It's all my fault.

651
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,351
I was on the phone…

652
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,356
and I didn't even hear him
calling out for help.

653
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,068
He had to go through surgery.

654
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,948
I think…

655
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,702
I might be too selfish
and weak to be a mother.

656
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,705
I'm not qualified to be one.

657
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:22,021
Your husband and I have nothing going on.

658
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,691
Stop writing wild stories by yourself.

659
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,485
I really hope we never
see each other ever again.

660
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:34,576
Our ill-fated relationship was
a terrible thing to have to endure.

TRAFFIC SAFETY

662
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,490
I wanted to make up

663
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,783
before I leave.

664
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,371
Just…

665
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,000
blame it on my inferiority complex.

666
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,337
When this all passes,

667
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,214
it won't be a big deal.

668
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,927
Anyway, let's meet in good spirits

669
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,262
the next time we see each other.

670
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,140
Wait, Jin-ha.

671
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:47,815
Are you…

672
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,527
going somewhere?

673
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,695
Yes.

674
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,283
Where are you going?

675
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,124
There's…

676
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,711
something I want to ask you.

677
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:22,767
You…

678
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,271
wish I would just disappear, don't you?

679
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:20,283
-How could you do that?
-Is it true?

680
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,784
-How could you?
-What were you thinking?

681

TRAFFIC SAFETY

682
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,253
WELCOME! MOVING COMPANY

683
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,131
Jin-ha!

684
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,633
Watch out, Jin-ha!

685
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,950
I wanted to make up before I leave.

686
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,286
Just…

687
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,123
blame it on my inferiority complex.

688
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,169
When this all passes,
it won't be a big deal.

689
01:01:56,462 --> 01:02:00,842
Anyway, let's meet in good spirits
the next time we see each other.

690
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:46,424
Was it really Henry's mom?

691
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:49,051
And I told her
I never wanted to see her again.

692
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,596
Was she not close to her husband?

693
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:53,347
Did he not say anything while carpooling?

694
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:57,768
Sometimes a director from downstairs
would come up for an interview.

695
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:02,481
Only our kids got accepted.
The rest got rejected, including Yu-bin.

696
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:05,401
I heard you were the last
to meet Jin-ha before she died.

697
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:09,030
What were you doing there?
What did the two of you talk about?

698
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:11,616
My husband is a policeman.

699
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,743
I've definitely seen
that woman somewhere before.

700
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:18,539
There's actually
something that I didn't mention.

701
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:24,962
