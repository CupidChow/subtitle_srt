1
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,585
She's so annoying.

2
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,003
Gosh.

3
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,640
I'll be late today, don't wait up.

4
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,022
Hey!

5
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,943
HOTEL

6
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,284
Sir, pull over here, please.

7
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,544
Lee Man-su! Byeon Chun-hui,
I know you're in there!

8
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,588
I know about everything!

9
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,634
Don't try to do anything sneaky.
Open the door.

10
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,762
Come out!

11
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,597
Hey!

12
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,599
Come out!

13
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,767
What's wrong with her?

14
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,935
Come out!

15
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,982
What do you think you're doing right now?

16
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,861
Where did you hide Man-su?

17
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,197
Lee Man-su, come out!

18
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,535
You're here, aren't you?

19
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,543
Where did you hide him?
Lee Man-su, come out!

20
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,463
Where is he?

21
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,885
I'm asking you what the hell you're doing!

22
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,307
Well…

23
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,769
Didn't I already tell you?
I wouldn't take him even if you ask me to.

24
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,398
Why do you keep coming up
with wild stories by yourself?

25
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,322
Chun-hui…

26
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,828
-Why are you in a motel with a woman?
-What does it matter to you?

27
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:52,041
Why do you care whether I'm with a man
or a woman in a motel?

28
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,294
What's going on?

29
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:55,920
What's…

30
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,005
Go in.

31
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,473
What's going on?

32
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,809
What is it?

33
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,770
Who are you?

34
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,273
She thought

35
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,610
I was having an affair
with her husband and followed me here.

36
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,112
What does she take me for?

37
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,866
Oh, really?

38
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,536
I'm sorry,

39
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:33,166
but the three of us are actually
best friends from the same town.

40
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,045
And we booked a room to drink together.

41
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,629
Would you care to join us?

42
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,008
Ask her to join us if you two are close.

43
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,051
We're not close.

44
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,721
Get out.

45
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,515
I said get out!

46
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,851
Who was that lady?

47
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,436
Is she going to be a problem?

48
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,313
No.

49
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,484
Seriously?

50
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,861
I thought you were good
about covering your tracks.

51
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,447
Hurry.

52
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,157
The wait has been killing me.

53
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,244
What's up?

54
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,579
You have another man besides me?

55
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,790
You're a popular one, aren't you?

56
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,172
All right.

57
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,560
Okay.

58
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,072
Take a seat.

59
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,999
I'm sorry for calling you at this hour.

60
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,250
It's not a problem.

61
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,210
I just arrived from France.

62
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,211
I see.

63
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,339
Can I offer you a drink or something?

64
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,966
Oh, no. I'm fine.

65
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,470
May I ask what it is
that you want to talk about?

66
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,721
Well…

67
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,474
To be honest…

68
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,978
Someone made an accusation
against the company.

69
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,608
Did something happen between you
and Dr. Kim Ju-seok from Eulju Hospital?

70
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,778
He mentioned that you've stolen
medication in the past.

71
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:15,286
Do you also happen to know Dr. Kim's wife?

72
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,753
When Dr. Kim's wife worked as a nurse,

73
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,090
she killed a patient.

74
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,384
It was medical malpractice.

75
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,515
And the day

76
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,726
my wife passed away,

77
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,689
Ms. Byeon Chun-hui
was the last to visit my house.

78
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,489
Is there anything else
that I should be aware of?

79
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,456
About that…

80
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,293
That wasn't Ms. Byeon Chun-hui's fault.

81
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,632
The incident you mentioned…

82
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,094
was Mr. Kim Ju-seok's fault,

83
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,347
but he blamed it on Ms. Byeon Chun-hui.

84
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,355
I didn't say a single word
the entire time.

85
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,900
You have no idea how much they grilled me.

86
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,862
You should be really thankful.

87
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,080
So I actually have a favor to ask you.

88
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,670
There's this guy I know that runs a shop.

89
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,508
His supplier got arrested
so he's completely dry now.

90
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,431
He says he'll pay at least
five times what it's worth.

91
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,938
What are you talking about right now?

92
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,151
Fentanyl and nalbuphine.

93
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,031
Can't you get it right away
if you tell your old man?

94
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,575
Isn't this why you became a doctor's wife?

95
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,830
He's not a trophy husband, is he?

96
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,060
CALLS

97
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,734
YOUR WICKED DEEDS EVEN IN DEATH

98
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:43,327
PARK YUN-JU

99
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,038
Can you drop by my house tomorrow morning?

100
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,715
EPISODE 10
WIND FROM THE TIP OF A SWORD

101
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,094
When I asked Dong-seok about it,
he said that Su-in gave it to him.

102
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,971
How do you explain this?

103
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,977
What's going on?

104
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,728
That woman, Byeon Chun-hui…

105
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,941
is Man-su's ex-girlfriend.

106
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,115
That really hurts my pride.

107
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,368
It feels like I'm some idiot

108
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,663
who picks up used furniture on the street.

109
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,877
It's so embarrassing!

110
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,587
I was…

111
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,090
only trying to scare her.

112
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,803
I wanted to scare her
and drive her out of the neighborhood.

113
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,682
But why would rumor say that
the letter was from Henry's mother?

114
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:52,229
And how did it end up in your hands?
None of it made any sense to me either.

115
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,318
Letters!

116
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,819
Goodness.

117
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,613
You're dropping everything.

118
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,281
So…

119
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:07,036
there's nothing to be suspicious
about her and Man-su, right?

120
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,708
Actually, Man-su texted me

121
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,086
saying that
he was running late last night.

122
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,507
Right then, I happened to see her
heading out somewhere.

123
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,258
So I followed her.

124
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,928
Are you serious?

125
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,764
I saw her heading into a motel.

126
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,558
So I freaked out seeing that.

127
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,268
A motel?

128
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,523
But…

129
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,485
she was there with a girl and a guy.

130
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,989
They said they were old friends
and booked a room to drink together.

131
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,157
So I ended up…

132
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,578
completely embarrassing myself.

133
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,039
That's what happened.

134
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,594
Let's just pretend it never happened.

135
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:14,812
It needs to be Jin-ha
who sent that letter until the end.

136
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,729
So let's cover it up.

137
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,612
YOUR WICKED DEEDS

138
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,452
So she never mentioned anything else…

139
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,249
apart from being suspicious
about me and Eun-pyo?

140
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,084
Yes.

141
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,555
I understand

142
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,975
why you would be curious
about the last thing she said,

143
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:58,105
but there's nothing
much more I can tell you.

144
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,694
I'll be leaving then.

145
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,364
Didn't she ask you for any drugs?

146
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,122
Sorry?

147
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:20,878
She was never the type
to meet friends late at night like that.

148
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:25,132
But what does that have to do with drugs?

149
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,678
And why would you ask me that--

150
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,306
I heard that you used to work as a nurse.

151
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,565
And my wife was suffering from insomnia.

152
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,113
Where are you?

153
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,658
Where are you right now?

154
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,494
You need to…

155
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,998
You need to come to where I am right now.

156
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,378
He seemed to know about everything.

157
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,338
All of it.

158
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,177
It wouldn't be too difficult to find out
if he was determined to uncover the truth.

159
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,682
But…

160
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,476
does that mean Seo Jin-ha

161
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,980
kept in contact with you the entire time?

162
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,483
So…

163
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,319
Even on the day that she died…

164
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,739
No way.

165
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,880
It's not my fault though.

166
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,548
All I did was…

167
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,718
All I did was

168
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,056
help her get some sleep.
I'm not the one who killed her.

169
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,433
Why are they doing this to me?

170
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,269
Why is everyone doing this to me?

171
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,357
Man-su, I'm scared.

172
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,652
I'm really scared.

173
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,907
What if it was really me who killed her?

174
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,034
What if it was all because of me?

175
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,550
I made sure to tell Louis
that it wasn't you.

176
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,595
And the investigation
has already been closed.

177
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,015
But you'll be in trouble
if you keep doing this.

178
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,101
You should stop all of that now.

179
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,813
You can do something else.
Why would you do something so dangerous?

180
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,399
If I don't,

181
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,944
then what about the tuition fees?

182
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,364
Your husband's a doctor.
Why would you worry about that?

183
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,496
I came to know after we got married
that he was in deep debt.

184
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,334
From gambling to booze and girls.

185
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:52,297
Even the alimony
from his divorce was still in full.

186
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,010
You should've…

187
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,680
ended things right then and there.

188
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,641
Why would a smart person
like you have second thoughts about it?

189
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,656
I didn't have the courage.

190
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,957
How could I tell my parents?
They were happy that I married a doctor.

191
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,544
How could I tell them
that I wanted to give up everything?

192
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,589
I didn't have the courage to tell them.

193
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,701
Man-su.

194
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,833
Is there any way…

195
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,632
Never mind.

196
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,302
What is it?

197
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,221
Just say it.

198
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,099
It's nothing. We should get going.

199
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,968
Lee Eun-pyo.

200
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,513
I know that your guilt
is messing with you,

201
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:51,184
but it's really low that you'd try to
place the blame on someone else.

202
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,187
What about everything she did to me then?

203
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,525
This is the 8th floor.

204
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,489
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

205
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,784
Thank you so much for agreeing
to come out on the show.

206
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:12,414
You have no idea how hard
it was for me to find gifted students.

207
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,794
We'll be shooting at Sangam Studio
and in addition to Dong-seok,

208
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,298
we have various other gifted students
who will be joining us.

209
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,884
They'll start individually
and then split up into teams.

210
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,260
What? Genius Kids Show?

211
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,554
He's going out there to be judged?

212
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,016
Why are you trying to
make him do things like that?

213
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,145
I should be asking you
why you're thinking like a caveman.

214
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,105
Opportunities like this don't come often.

215
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,317
I don't think we should make him do it.

216
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,277
That's really intense…

217
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,613
I mean,

218
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,325
Dong-seok is a sensitive kid.

219
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,871
What if he goes on TV
and all it does is mess with his head?

220
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,334
Did you already forget how people
treated him when we only stood up for him?

221
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:02,339
You should stop
keeping him cooped up so much.

222
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:06,384
You should think about it one more time.

223
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,553
You're getting
ahead of yourself these days.

224
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,765
Stop annoying me and get out
if you're going to keep talking nonsense.

225
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,810
Did you talk to Dong-seok about it?
Did he say he wanted to do it?

226
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,145
Of course.
You have no idea how excited he is.

227
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,982
Are you sure you didn't push him to do it?

228
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,654
What are you trying to say right now?

229
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,824
Dong-seok is a gifted child.

230
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,619
If we don't dig deep and cultivate
his brain, he could lose his spark.

231
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,371
Do you want him to resent you later?

232
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,293
He has to experience many things

233
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,879
to be even more motivated in the future.

234
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,341
You're not on watch
the day after tomorrow, right?

235
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,595
-Watch Dong-ju. We have the shoot.
-Hey, come on!

236
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,182
The prize is five million won.
You don't think he's going to win?

237
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,061
Don't you dare think about
doing anything with that prize money.

238
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,320
-Mom, I have to pee.
-Okay, let's go.

239
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,531
-I'm thirsty.
-Have some milk.

240
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,241
SPATIAL PERCEPTION PRODIGY
JUNG DONG-SEOK

241
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,454
Mom, are you nervous?

242
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,373
No.

243
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,041
You?

244
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,419
-Are you nervous?
-No.

245
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,839
Really? You're feeling good, right?

246
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,132
Oh, right.

247
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,051
Let's make sure you take this

248
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,679
before you head in there.

249
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,472
Make sure you're feeling tip-top.

250
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,641
Good job.

251
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,895
We're going to have
all the participants head on set now.

252
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,937
Okay.

253
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,858
-Don't be nervous.
-Okay.

254
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,234
-You can do it!
-I can do it!

255
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,694
All right.

256
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,573
We've gathered the kids
with the sexiest brains in all of Korea.

257
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,451
Genius Kids Show and the gifted judges!

258
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,120
CHEMISTRY PRODIGY PRINCESS!!
PARK JIN-A!

259
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,330
Without further ado,

260
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,291
I'll be introducing our participants,
the smartest kids

261
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,377
from a variety of different subjects.

262
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,129
Our first participant

263
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,507
possesses high intuition
and a remarkable sense of imagination.

264
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,928
A spatial perception prodigy,
Jung Dong-seok!

265
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,597
Dong-seok,
could you give us a brief introduction?

266
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,392
Hello, my name is Jung Dong-seok and
I'm a first-grader from Sangwe Elementary.

267
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,811
All right, Dong-seok,

268
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,398
how did you make the final decision
to come out on our show?

269
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,817
I wanted to make my mom happy.

270
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,362
You wanted to make your mom happy?

271
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:34,032
It seems like you
and your mom are really close.

272
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,492
Can I ask you

273
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:39,412
what's the one thing
that your mom says to you the most?

274
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,832
"Don't run.
The neighbor downstairs will come up."

275
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,877
All right.

276
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,171
All right, let's move on
to the next question.

277
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,049
Imagine that you've gone
to the land of the giants.

278
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:55,387
You go for a short stroll
before coming across an unknown object.

279
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,432
Can you see the image on the screen?
What could this unknown object be?

280
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,017
TEAM B
90

281
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,852
Yes, Dong-seok from Team B.

282
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,646
The letters for "birthday"?

283
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,231
The letters for "birthday."

284
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,401
BIRTHDAY

285
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,736
Birthday is correct!

286
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,739
Wow, congratulations Dong-seok!

287
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,243
Dong-seok really hit the nail on the head.

288
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,328
They call him
the spatial perception prodigy

289
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,080
-Dong-seok's mother.
-and I absolutely believe it.

290
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,750
Thanks to Dong-seok's efforts,
Team B will receive the point.

291
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,212
All right. Team A has tossed the dice

292
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,840
and their numbers
are nine, six, and eight.

293
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,676
I wonder which team will use
all of the numbers together

294
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,429
to add, subtract, multiply, and divide

295
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,765
-to get to all the numbers on the board…
-Me!

296
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,684
Yes, Ji-hui from Team A.

297
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,145
9 times 8 times 6 is 432.

298
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:49,149
9 times 8 times 6 is 432.
Is that the correct answer?

299
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,651
Team A gets it right!

300
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,488
-Yes!
-Thanks to Team A's efforts…

301
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:59,075
-Team B is not great at arithmetics.
-Okay, now only one more number

302
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,495
is left for Team A to complete
a line to get bingo.

303
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,497
Team B, let's try harder.

304
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:08,793
We're now at the final question,
the one we've all been waiting for.

305
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,838
Will it be Team A that locks in the win?

306
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,007
Or will Team B show
a come-from-behind victory?

307
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,384
Now, for our final question.

308
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,180
Your friend Cheol-su
breaks up a bar of chocolate

309
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,307
and writes a number on each of the pieces.

310
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,894
What number should be there
for the question mark?

311
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,522
Okay, Dong-seok just pressed his buzzer.

312
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,901
It seems like Dong-seok might actually
already know the answer.

313
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,402
The answer is six!

314
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,114
Then can you come out
and explain to us how you got the answer?

315
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,954
WHAT NUMBER SHOULD BE
AT THE QUESTION MARK?

316
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,832
This isn't a question
where you have to use arithmetic.

317
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,543
He's following a rule where the chocolate

318
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,587
can only be broken up
into perfect squares.

319
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,382
So this one is…

320
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:57,967
One.

321
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,720
Two.

322
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,932
Three.

323
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,225
And this one is…

324
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,477
six.

325
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,604
Seven.

326
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,147
So this one is…

327
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,567
five…

328
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:16,903
six.

329
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,656
That's how I got six.

330
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,408
If six is the correct answer,

331
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,577
that means Team B
will come from behind to beat Team A.

332
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,287
But if it's not the correct answer,

333
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,791
then Team A will have
the opportunity to make a guess.

334
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,167
I wonder what it will be.

335
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,090
That is correct! Congratulations!

336
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:40,176
I'm happy to announce that Team B has won!
Congratulations!

337
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,765
Congratulations, Team B!

338
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,308
CONGRATULATIONS

339
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,577
TEAM B WINS

340
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,205
My goodness, look at that!

341
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,082
Gosh, you're really something else.

342
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,084
My little Dong-seok, my precious baby.

343
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,420
My goodness.

344
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:20,008
Mom, they said that the last question
was a really hard one.

345
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,885
They said even adults can't solve it.

346
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,219
Is that so?

347
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,305
-Really?
-Yes.

348
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,520
MOTHER-IN-LAW

349
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,858
Gosh, I saw on the television
and my grandson was the smartest

350
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,778
and the most handsome!

351
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,240
How does he look just like his dad?

352
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,744
I know, he looked exactly like
Jae-ung on TV.

353
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,541
You must've worked so hard.

354
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:58,296
Behind every incredible child,
there's always an incredible mother.

355
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,422
Thank you.

356
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:03,176
I deserve some credit too.

357
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:07,972
I knew that I just couldn't sit back
and let you stay in Singu-dong.

358
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,558
I think I deserve some kudos for that!

359
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,604
Gosh.

360
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,565
All right, come visit with the kids.

361
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,567
I'm going to feed my grandkids well

362
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,195
so that I can see them off
to Geoseong University,

363
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,031
-even though their father never made it.
-Okay.

364
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,074
Geoseong University?

365
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,202
-Yes, Mother. Enjoy your evening.
-All right.

366
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,248
Dong-seok is so impressive!
Take us out to eat sometime.

367
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,041
Congratulations, Eun-pyo.

368
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,459
Dong-seok was awesome.

369
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,794
Don't forget about taking us out.

370
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,462
Let's all have brunch together.

371
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,881
-Great idea!
-Thank you so much.

372
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,051
I'm so jealous. You raised a good kid.

373
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,595
I was so nervous even until the end.

374
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,931
Let's pick the date. It's on me.

375
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,933
Oh, right.

376
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:56,354
ALMOST A STRANGER

377
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,981
Did you watch it?

378
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,233
Yes, I did.

379
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,778
See? I told you
our son was going to do well.

380
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,530
You're right.

381
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,952
-Are you going to be late today?
-Yes, the guys want to…

382
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,036
One second.

383
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,997
Gosh, Eun-pyo, congratulations!

384
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,790
Congratulations, Eun-pyo.

385
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,459
Eun-pyo, we need to go out
for a meal to celebrate.

386
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,045
Can you wire us just 100,000 won
from that 5 million won prize?

387
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,674
I'm just going to have
a drink before I head in.

388
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,802
Okay, just one drink.

389
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,178
All right.

390
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,182
-Let's roll!
-It's a work dinner!

391
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,851
GRAND PRIZE

392
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,186
All right, I want to see big smiles.

393
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,397
Okay, here we go. One, two.

394
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,066
Okay, good. Let's do one more. One, two.

395
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,776
Very good.

396
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,739
Can you tilt your certificate this way?

397
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,993
Great, here we go. Wonderful.

398
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,828
AWARD CERTIFICATE
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION

399
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,623
GRAND PRIZE, JUNG DONG-SEOK

400
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,957
GOLD PRIZE, JUNG DONG-SEOK

401
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,292
GRAND PRIZE, JUNG DONG-SEOK

402
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,428
Let's eat quickly.

403
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,933
There's going to be a lot of traffic soon.
You might be late for your academy.

404
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,310
You did all your homework, right?

405
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,103
Did you say you had a test today?

406
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,397
We have to prepare
for your advancement test too.

407
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,566
There's barely enough time.

408
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,073
You're the kid
from the Genius Kids Show, right?

409
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,367
I think it's him.

410
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,327
Gosh, you were really smart out there.

411
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,080
I bet your mom doesn't even
need to eat to feel satisfied.

412
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,206
Am I right?

413
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,667
You're shy, aren't you?

414
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,878
You were so lively
and playful on the show.

415
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,423
I'm sorry, but my boy is quite shy.

416
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,925
Okay.

417
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,511
-Geniuses are always a little sensitive.
-That's right.

418
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,889
How do the studios give you
the scholarships when you win?

419
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,433
-What?
-Do they wire it or give it in cash?

420
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,602
Gosh, do you really think
they'd give it out in cash?

421
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:03,898
There you go!

422
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,238
Eun-pyo, were there any signs?

423
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,908
Things that you later found out
were signs that he was gifted?

424
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,576
I'm not sure.

425
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:21,082
He used to draw a lot of mazes
since he was young.

426
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,002
I thought he was just doodling.
But according to his teacher,

427
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,921
that's what a lot of kids
with good spatial perception like to do.

428
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,341
I'm so jealous.

429
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,344
You must've been a national hero
in your previous life.

430
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,430
How did you give birth
to such a smart child?

431
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,640
I bet she saved the country
at least three different times.

432
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,978
Please, it's not as though
I don't have any worries of my own.

433
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,647
I have a lot of
difficult things to deal with.

434
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,654
By the way,
I haven't seen Yu-bin since last time.

435
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,700
I feel like it's been a while
since I've seen her.

436
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,286
It's been a while for us too.

437
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,203
Yes.

438
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,914
She hasn't even been coming
to her academy classes.

439
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,043
I heard a rumor
that they were going to move out.

440
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,630
But you know, no one's trying
to keep her mom around anymore.

441
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,301
Yes, especially after
what she did to Eun-pyo.

442
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,343
That's right!

443
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,470
Gosh.

444
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,726
The game is a tie at five to five.
Good work everyone.

445
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,564
That'll be it for today.
Let's all go get some water.

446
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,066
Over to the water fountains.

447
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,525
JUNG DONG-SEOK

448
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:37,450
Hey, do you think this water fountain
works off of reverse osmosis

449
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,286
or uses the hollow filter method?

450
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,580
I wonder which one it is.

451
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,499
Do you guys know?

452
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,376
What's he talking about?
He always says weird stuff like that.

453
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,878
-Let's go.
-Yes.

454
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,004
SONG JAE-BIN
YOON MIN-JI

455
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,722
Darn it, Jung Dong-ju.
I told you not to do that!

456
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,809
Dong-seok, why are you yelling
at your brother like that?

457
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,977
And what's with your language?

458
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:09,107
You don't even know what happened.
Why are you always on Dong-ju's side?

459
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,943
How dare you speak that way?

460
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,751
Hello.

461
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,963
Hello.

462
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,469
Hi.

463
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,117
HN ACADEMY FOR GIFTED STUDENTS
TEST RESULT

464
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,932
KIM YEONG-BIN'S TEST RESULTS SHOW
HE IS NOT SUITABLE FOR OUR ACADEMY

465
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,100
INADEQUATE

466
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,413
It's okay.

467
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,501
I'll find you another academy to go to.

468
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,213
This one was too hard…

469
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,341
It was a difficult academy to get into.

470
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,551
I made a mistake.

471
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,805
I'm sorry.

472
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,100
I'm sorry for not getting good results.

473
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,689
I know that you and Dad both hate me.

474
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,983
I'm not good at studying

475
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,860
and I suck at sports too.

476
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,197
You spend so much money on me

477
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,993
but I'm still not good at anything.

478
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,456
I think I'm just too dumb.

479
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,169
Mom…

480
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,090
you're unhappy because of me.

481
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,593
Mom…

482
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,221
you're unhappy

483
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,890
because of me.

484
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,819
MR. LEE

485
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,035
Hey.

486
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,665
There haven't really been
any updates so far.

487
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,294
He said he'll be returning to France
once they reassign him.

488
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,631
But he didn't mention anything
about what was to happen after that.

489
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,428
So what are you going to do?

490
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,805
Tell me.

491
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,016
What's your next plan?

492
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,518
I don't know yet.

493
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,609
Maybe…

494
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,416
You have to be on your toes from now on.

495
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,337
If you are to achieve the desired results
at KJMO and make it to the national team,

496
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,964
your child should learn
the deep thinking skills

497
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,008
that will help them meld
all of the curricula together.

498
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,761
No matter how brilliant your child may be,

499
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,013
it's only one subject
that they really shine in.

500
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,182
They've yet to integrate all the subjects.

501
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,476
The students who make it through this

502
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,770
will meet each other again
at the science or gifted schools.

503
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:01,065
Then they will meet again
at the top medical universities in Korea.

504
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:05,486
That's why this is the most important
moment of their lives.

505
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,704
Sorry.

506
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,511
May I speak to the person who called?

507
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,512
How could he speak like that?

508
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,680
Ms. Lee Eun-pyo?

509
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,723
-What does he think of us?
-Just ignore him.

510
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,475
-Let's go.
-Who is this?

511
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,726
LECTURER PROFILE
NAME: LEE EUN-PYO

512
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,936
Hello.

513
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,814
I'm Bang Jeong-hui and I'm the chairman
of the Sungmyung University Foundation.

514
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,483
Perhaps you don't remember me.

515
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,986
We met briefly during the awards ceremony.

516
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,364
Oh, hello.

517
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,741
May I ask what you're calling for?

518
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,035
Is it because of my boy?

519
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,164
No. This call is for you, actually.

520
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,623
For me?

521
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,709
Someone recommended you for this position.

522
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,378
They said that they were watching a show

523
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,048
and saw a lecturer
who had been unjustly fired.

524
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,011
I'm sure you're aware
that Geoseong University and our school

525
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,637
are rivals.

526
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,725
That means we can't recruit lecturers
directly from their pool

527
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,435
even if we'd love to.

528
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,356
It's a faction that's been
going on for decades

529
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,568
so it won't be that easy
to shrug off even for professors.

530
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,903
Indeed.

531
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,739
Professors of the arts
can be incredibly childish.

532
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:39,330
I heard you almost finished
your doctorate in France

533
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,208
and your thesis was quite the sensation.

534
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:48,088
I still never went on
to finish that degree, though.

535
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,967
The ideas in my thesis

536
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:56,096
did seem to have an effect
on the scene in Korea, thankfully.

537
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,814
How does the president
of the school feel about it?

538
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,401
I doubt that all the professors
are welcome to have me here.

539
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,282
Some of those grumpy
old academics would be against it.

540
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,245
But I quite like you, Eun-pyo.

541
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,871
As a mother,

542
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,624
I want to help out a fellow mom
who had to stop her career.

543
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,170
As long as you're okay with it,

544
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:32,424
I'll have a talk with the president
and other staff before calling you again.

545
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,344
What do you think?

546
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,430
Would you like to lecture

547
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,599
at our university?

548
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,567
As soon as the weekend comes,
he gauges my mood,

549
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,444
and then he goes out for a smoke.

550
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,071
And then he doesn't come back.

551
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,615
When I call him,
he says "I'm playing golf."

552
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,076
Gosh, can't he stop playing golf?

553
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,037
At least he's getting
some sort of exercise.

554
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,331
All my husband does
on the weekends is sleep.

555
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,211
What's Dong-seok's father like?
Is he a gentleman?

556
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,386
Dong-seok's mom.

557
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:41,845
Yes?

558
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,723
What are you staring
into your phone like that for?

559
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,850
You have a packed schedule, don't you?

560
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,061
-Dong-seok?
-Yes, Dong-seok.

561
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,688
It's nothing.

562
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,315
What were we just talking about?

563
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:59,780
As soon as the weekend comes,
he gauges my mood,

564
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,449
and then he goes out for a smoke.

565
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,076
And then he doesn't come back.

566
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,453
When I call him,
he says "I'm playing golf."

567
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,654
Hello?

568
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:43,407
Hello, we're calling
from Segyeong Telecom.

569
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:48,078
We're reaching out to our most valuable
customers to offer the latest phones.

570
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,982
Jung Dong-seok.

571
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,735
If you came home,
you should at least say hi and go in.

572
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,529
Wash your hands before you go in.

573
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,199
SEONGLIM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

574
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,701
Her arm was injured
when she came to the hospital,

575
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:31,330
but she kept acting strange
when she wasn't even drunk.

576
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,291
She left while she was waiting
for her appointment

577
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,043
but I think she was on drugs.

578
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,836
Play that back for me.

579
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,233
Hey.

580
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,485
I feel like this might be a domino.

581
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,862
If we topple one,
all of them might start falling.

582
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:04,947
I know, right?

583
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,200
Gosh, do you have
a gut feeling about this?

584
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,079
Dad!

585
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,789
-Pick me up!
-All right.

586
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,088
Where's Mom?

587
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:22,965
Mom?

588
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,680
What are you doing?

589
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,265
Are you going to wash up?

590
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,864
Honey, I need my phone.

591
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,826
I'm taking a poop right now!
Just tell them to call back later.

592
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:54,955
No, it's an urgent call. Hurry!

593
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,164
Jeez.

594
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,626
SUNGMYUNG UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION CHAIRMAN

595
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:05,966
Hello?

596
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,928
Yes.

597
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,642
Okay.

598
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,644
I see.

599
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:22,941
Yes, I understand.

600
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,777
Of course.

601
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,448
Look, I'm driving.

602
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,161
Jae-ung.

603
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,914
What's up?

604
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,378
What is it?

605
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,131
Did I do something wrong?

606
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,841
I…

607
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,469
got appointed.

608
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,553
What?

609
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,474
I got appointed.

610
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,517
Sungmyung University wants me
to start lecturing a course on aesthetics

611
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,561
because a spot just opened up!

612
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:03,440
Eun-pyo! How did that happen?

613
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,942
What happened all of a sudden?

614
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:09,029
-Remember how we went to the ceremony?
-Yes.

615
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,448
I met the chairman
and we took a picture together,

616
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,824
and then she contacted me.

617
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,911
So we met up, but I wasn't expecting
anything at all to come of it.

618
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,829
-But what do you know?
-My gosh, Eun-pyo!

619
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,082
Dong-seok, Dong-ju,
Mommy's a professor now!

620
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:23,377
-Mommy's a Sungmyung University professor!
-Dong-ju!

621
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,589
-We have a professor in our family now!
-Dong-seok!

622
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,926
So when do you start classes?

623
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,595
-They want me to start right away!
-Right away?

624
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,391
-Yes!
-Mommy's going to teach students now!

625
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,351
I can't believe it!

626
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:43,063
You worked so hard. I told you
you'd become a professor, didn't I?

627
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,564
I knew you could do it.

628
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:49,486
This is so exciting. Go, Mommy!

629
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,527
Hello, everyone.

630
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,280
I'll be taking over
for Professor Jang this semester,

631
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,116
and will be teaching
Introduction to Aesthetics.

632
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,952
My name is Lee Eun-pyo.

633
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,929
Hurry up, Dong-seok.

634
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:01,057
You have to get your presentation ready
so that you can practice it.

635
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,560
You might not get upgraded at this rate.

636
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,270
Let's not let our guard down, okay?

637
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,898
-Mom.
-Yes?

638
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:13,195
How come I have to study every day
when Dong-ju gets to play?

639
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,197
Are you and Dong-ju the same?

640
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,449
Dong-ju's still a baby and you're older.

641
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:20,160
Quit your whining and get started.

642
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,959
What are you doing? You have to start now.
I have a lot of work to do.

643
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,421
It's spinning well.

644
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,173
Oh, it hit the side.

645
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,716
-Emergency!
-Jung Dong-ju!

646
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,135
I told you not to touch that.

647
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,346
Mind your own business and just study!

648
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,056
I told you not to touch that.

649
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,642
Stop touching my things!

650
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,019
Jung Dong-seok.

651
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,813
Why are you worrying about that?

652
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:51,608
Finish what you were working on
and stop getting so distracted.

653
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,536
Dong-seok, what are you doing?

654
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:07,123
Jung Dong-seok!
What do you think you're doing?

655
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:11,545
I'm not going to do it!
I'm not going to do anything!

656
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,220
I'm sorry, Dong-seok.

657
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,348
Are you mad at me?

658
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,692
Dong-ju says he's sorry.

659
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:37,362
Calm down and finish
what you were working on, okay?

660
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,449
FINNISH

661
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:54,504
Hey, you drive. I need to rest.

662
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,592
Get in.

663
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,802
Hurry up.

664
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,392
That's exactly what I hate about Koreans.

665
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,686
They forget their place
if you treat them nicely.

666
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,481
Jeez, they'll only realize
how stupid they were

667
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,692
after messing things up.

668
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,612
That's exactly what it is, Dr. Kim.

669
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,489
Those uneducated ones
always show how stupid they are.

670
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,824
Right now?

671
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,702
I have plans today.

672
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,580
Let's have a drink
in Nonhyeon-dong this week.

673
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:32,334
All right. Okay, bye.

674
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:38,298
You guys know what I'm saying, right?

675
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,051
You have to work hard.

676
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,511
Unless you want to be
treated like an imbecile.

677
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:47,182
The most important thing in Korea
is your educational background.

678
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,266
Understand?

679
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,560
Goodness.

680
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,858
Hey, did you ask my mom for money?

681
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,111
Why?

682
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,740
Why do you have to ask my mom for money?
It makes me feel bad.

683
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,910
Do you have any idea how much money
she spent to make me a doctor?

684
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:10,372
Do you even have a conscience?

685
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,167
This is why daughters-in-law
will never really be part of the family.

686
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,504
All they ever think about
is how precious their own children are.

687
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:21,925
You're trying to get your hands
on her pension.

688
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,178
Go and apologize to her today.

689
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,119
Get out.

690
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,204
What do you think you're doing?

691
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,372
Get out!

692
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:58,586
What are you doing?

693
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,840
If your mom worked so hard
to make you a doctor,

694
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:06,386
then you should be a good son to her.
Stop forcing me to be nice to her.

695
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,305
-What?
-If you provided us with enough money,

696
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,725
I'd have kept my pride
and never asked her for help.

697
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:16,646
If you'd kept half of your gambling money,
I'd never have had to ask her for help.

698
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,358
You love trying to be good to your mother,

699
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,737
so you always drag the whole family
to her house every weekend.

700
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,240
How come we never visited
my dad who's been bedridden for ten years?

701
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,493
You care so much about your mother.

702
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,246
Why can't you care about my dad like that?

703
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,457
What kind of nonsense are you on about?

704
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,835
Did you marry me out of love?

705
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:42,505
You should be happy that I made you
a doctor's wife. What more do you want?

706
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:47,052
Also, if I never met you,
my life wouldn't have ended up like this.

707
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:50,346
Do you think you're the only one
who feels that way?

708
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,806
Seriously…

709
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,129
Hey! Byeon Chun-hui!

710
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:24,672
Hey!

711
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:29,260
Even though you didn't practice,
you can still do a good job, right?

712
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,346
This is a piece of cake for you, right?

713
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,267
-Hello, Dong-seok's mom.
-Mom.

714
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,727
-Hello.
-Long time no see.

715
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:38,937
Let's head in.

716
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,439
-Did you prepare?
-We worked really hard.

717
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,693
-Hurry up.
-Come on, this way.

718
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,237
Let's head in with Su-in.

719
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:52,283
They discovered that gravitational density
shrinks as the distance grows larger.

720
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:55,495
That concludes my report. Thank you.

721
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,873
It's so obvious that his mom
wrote that for him, isn't it?

722
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,209
He should've practiced more
to make it less obvious.

723
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,545
Is that what you did?

724
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,421
We didn't practice at all.

725
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,258
All right, next, we have Jung Dong-seok.

726
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,051
Dong-seok, it's your turn.

727
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,183
It's Dong-seok's turn.

728
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:22,772
Let's see, it looks like Dong-seok
did a report on the rules behind language?

729
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,608
Could you explain what you did?

730
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,082
Dong-seok?

731
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,255
What's going on with Dong-seok?

732
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,174
Dong-seok?

733
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,177
Come on.

734
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,345
You have to do it.

735
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,392
-Hey!
-Hey, where are you going?

736
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,768
Where are you going?

737
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,645
Dong-seok…

738
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,731
-Dong-seok!
-Where are you going?

739
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,276
All right, well…

740
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,987
Jung Dong-seok!

741
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,909
Jung Dong-seok,
where do you think you're going?

742
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,832
Dong-seok!

743
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,587
Dong-seok!

744
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:40,058
Jung Dong-seok! Stop right there.

745
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,145
It's dangerous!

746
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:46,814
Hey!

747
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,153
What are you doing?

748
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:14,968
It's okay.

749
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:34,904
Is everything okay, Eun-pyo?

750
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,073
What's going on with Dong-seok?

751
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,700
Dong-seok.

752
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,954
-Dong-seok.
-What's wrong with him?

753
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:45,790
-What's going on with him? Is he hurt?
-What's going on?

754
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,047
All right. Let's go.

755
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:35,965
Goodness.

756
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:41,471
I told them to eat something expensive,
but they insisted on eating these.

757
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,849
There's nothing better
than ice cream for kids.

758
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:46,017
Go in and sit.

759
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,562
I was looking forward to treating
my grandkids to something special.

760
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:04,160
Aren't you supposed to go
to your in-laws today?

761
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,582
They went on a trip.

762
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,834
I see.

763
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:16,714
You didn't fight with Ju-seok, did you?

764
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,216
No.

765
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,932
Just be good to them.

766
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,185
Parents who make their children doctors

767
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,646
are different from others.

768
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,822
Give it to me. I'll do it.

769
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:58,965
Really?

770
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,801
I got into the School for Gifted Students.

771
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,803
I even won the grand prize
at the mathematics competition.

772
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:08,182
That's amazing!
My granddaughter is the best!

773
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,854
There's going to be
a creativity competition coming up soon.

774
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:16,065
If I win first place there,
I can receive the Minister Prize too.

775
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,608
My gosh.

776
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,944
Why didn't you mention it until now?

777
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:23,865
Yu-bin's been winning awards
and getting accepted everywhere.

778
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:29,036
There's nothing you can't do, is there?

779
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,665
My goodness.
I looked at a lot of ads in English…

780
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,751
-Yu-bin.
-Yes?

781
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,265
Yu-bin, what's wrong with you?

782
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,266
What do you mean?

783
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:55,354
You never made it
into the School for Gifted Students.

784
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,440
The mathematics competition too.

785
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,609
What are you talking about, Mom?

786
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,195
I got into the School for Gifted Students.

787
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,447
And I got first place
in the mathematics competition.

788
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,200
I get first place in everything.

789
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,244
That's why I make you happy, right?

790
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:33,768
PYEONGTAEK HOSPITAL

791
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,870
Did he not tell you what happened?

792
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:56,082
Why is he so worn out?

793
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:00,962
I think it was just too much stress
for him to handle all of a sudden.

794
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,964
He'll be fine after he gets some rest.

795
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,927
It wasn't anything that happened
between him and the other kids?

796
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,932
Or maybe you pushed him too much and--

797
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,725
Why is it my fault again?

798
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,395
Don't you think
it's cruel and irresponsible

799
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:19,272
that people always blame the mother?

800
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,111
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

801
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:29,282
It's not unusual for children his age
to have accidents.

802
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,409
You said so yourself that you had to go

803
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:35,329
to the bathroom or felt like running away
when you had to do presentations.

804
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,300
I'm going to go get some fresh air.

805
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,069
What are you doing?

806
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,030
Dong-seok…

807
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,908
Dong-seok is…

808
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,631
What's going on Dong-seok?

809
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:54,510
Why do you have that bag on your head?

810
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:59,724
Dong-seok, you can't breathe under there.
Let's take it off.

811
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:03,769
Jung Dong-seok!

812
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,188
What are you doing?
Take it off immediately!

813
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,107
Eun-pyo, stop it. Calm down.

814
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,110
Don't do this Dong-seok!

815
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,738
Why are you acting like this?
You're breaking my heart!

816
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,322
Eun-pyo, you're scaring him.

817
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:21,245
Dong-seok.

818
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:24,350
Do you think I've done something wrong?

819
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,270
I don't know why I keep lying.

820
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,773
So are you saying she's insane or what?

821
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:34,276
I'm sure he'll start talking
if we find the reason.

822
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:38,948
Let's find out why you keep lying.

823
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:41,367
I'm sorry for everything.

824
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:45,079
I never thought
you truly liked me as a friend.

825
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:47,748
I want our family to be perfect.

826
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:51,585
But why does my loneliness keep growing?

827
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,420
I want you to smile happily.

828
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:57,258
That's the only thing I want from you now.

829
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:02,930
