1
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,501
Ms. Byeon Chun-hui.

2
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,045
Please come with us.

3
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,843
Can I…

4
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,307
have a moment to talk with my children?

5
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,692
Yu-bin.

6
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,903
Yeong-bin.

7
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,407
Mommy's going to go
somewhere with that man…

8
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,955
and be right back, okay?

9
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,081
No.

10
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,708
Mom, don't go.

11
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,377
Please.

12
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,088
Mom.

13
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,007
-Mom.
-Mom.

14
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,427
Is it because of me?

15
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:21,057
I won't give you a hard time anymore.

16
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,476
And I won't lie anymore.

17
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,271
-No, it's not that.
-I'll listen to everything you say.

18
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,773
No, Yu-bin. It's not that.

19
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,400
It's not that, Yu-bin.

20
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,278
No, it's not that, Yu-bin.

21
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,864
It's not that, Yu-bin.

22
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,076
-Mom.
-It's not your fault.

23
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,164
It's not your fault.

24
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,457
It's not.

25
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,211
Look at Mommy.

26
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:55,174
Mommy's going to come back.
I'll come back no matter what, okay?

27
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:59,470
You know Mommy loves you
more than anything else, right?

28
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:04,392
You two are all I've got.

29
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,395
You have to remember that.

30
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,482
-Mom.
-Mom.

31
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,325
Mom.

32
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,664
Eun-pyo.

33
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,337
Please look after my kids for me.

34
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,178
Yu-bin.

35
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,306
-Mom.
-Yu-bin.

36
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,517
-Yu-bin.
-Mom.

37
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,562
It's okay.

38
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,648
Mom!

39
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,191
Yu-bin.

40
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,319
Mom!

41
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,738
-Mom!
-Yu-bin.

42
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,658
Mom.

43
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,159
She's going to be right back.

44
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,913
Mom.

45
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,638
This is the doll
you were looking for, right?

46
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,942
He found Ruby for you.

47
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,222
You've been working
with red-light district workers,

48
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,517
housewives, models, and even celebrities
for the past three years.

49
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,228
That's quite a wide range of clientele.

50
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,189
Did you ever run into any accidents
when injecting your clients?

51
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,358
No, that never happened.

52
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,736
Then what happened with Ms. Seo Jin-ha?

53
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,116
What are you--

54
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,909
Jang Won-tae told us everything.

55
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:31,664
So I'm asking you if Ms. Seo Jin-ha
died because of an adverse drug reaction.

56
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,583
No, that's not the case at all.

57
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,712
I saw her wake up with my own eyes.

58
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,258
I was the one who refused
when she asked for more doses.

59
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,344
I'm telling the truth.
I even have a witness.

60
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,473
You don't know how etomidate works.

61
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,392
The hallucination
only lasts for a short period

62
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,228
and as soon as you wake up,
the effects wear off immediately.

63
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:58,900
The fact that Henry's mother died
that day was a pure coincidence.

64
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,276
Ms. Byeon Chun-hui.

65
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,819
Dong-seok's father.

66
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,198
More than that,

67
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,493
I thought there was…

68
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,206
something off about her husband.

69
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,837
That day…

70
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,175
while Henry's mother had fallen asleep,

71
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:30,056
I went into Henry's room to look
at some of his studying materials.

72
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,436
Henry's father wasn't
anywhere close to the room.

73
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,565
He was in the study

74
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,986
on the phone with someone.

75
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,864
But when he was asked about it,

76
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,870
he said that he was trying to put
his boy to sleep and had no idea.

77
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,164
He even asked me

78
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,751
if I'd given her any medication.

79
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,546
Did she not ask you for any drugs?

80
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,762
My wife was suffering
from severe insomnia.

81
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,556
I was so shocked

82
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,267
that I had to leave the situation.

83
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,810
When was that?

84
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,728
I think…

85
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,398
it was maybe

86
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,609
about one month after she died.

87
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,903
I was so scared

88
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,365
that he would report me.

89
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,327
But he didn't say anything to anyone.

90
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,707
Doesn't that come off as strange to you?

91
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,380
Why did you quit your job all of a sudden?

92
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,924
Looking at your records here,

93
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,427
you once killed a person
and it was classified as manslaughter.

94
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,013
That wasn't me.

95
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,558
The hospital blamed it on me
to cover up for one of their doctors.

96
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,477
A doctor? Which doctor?

97
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:03,816
You'll have to give us a name for us
to check if you're telling the truth.

98
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,820
My husband.

99
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,828
Look here, Ms. Byeon Chun-hui.

100
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,915
If you're going to tell lies,
at least make them sound believable.

101
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,543
How can you drag anyone into the corner
whenever you get vulnerable?

102
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,421
Don't you think that's a bit shameless?

103
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,487
EPISODE 16
THE WARM HAND YOU EXTENDED

104
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,322
I'm the one who reported it!

105
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,783
Isn't it right to get punished
if you did something wrong?

106
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,244
But still, how could you report someone?

107
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,871
Did she ever do anything
to hurt you personally?

108
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,290
Yes, she did!

109
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,168
Remember what her daughter did to Su-in?

110
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,754
That was something
that happened between the kids!

111
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,172
Don't be ridiculous.

112
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,758
You even stayed in touch
with her behind my back!

113
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,596
If I never confronted you about it,
wouldn't you have run off with her?

114
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,638
Hey!

115
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,099
I told you Chun-hui
and I aren't like that!

116
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,103
"Chun-hui"?

117
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,607
All right.
Now your true colors are coming out.

118
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,025
Let's just stop this.

119
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,110
You're just so sick
and tired of me, right?

120
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,072
You'd toss me out if you could, right?

121
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,073
Jeez.

122
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,242
You hate me because
I reported your girlfriend, right?

123
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,328
Seriously, come on!

124
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,080
Darn it!

125
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,259
Seriously!

126
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,345
Damn it.

127
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,605
Get out.

128
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,608
I can't live with someone

129
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,737
who cares about his ex-girlfriend
more than he does his wife or kid.

130
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,666
Jae-ung.

131
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,146
Jae-ung.

132
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,818
I'm sorry.

133
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,197
I feel so ashamed.

134
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,579
I know nothing I say
can forgive my actions--

135
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,746
Do you…

136
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,420
even know what you did wrong?

137
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,051
You were harboring a criminal
and even assisting escape.

138
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,096
Normally, I'd have to arrest you too.

139
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,396
Did you even know that she was injecting
your dead friend Seo Jin-ha with drugs?

140
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,441
I'm saying that your friend's death

141
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,943
might be because of that woman.

142
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,363
No.

143
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,618
That can't be true.

144
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:10,206
She said Jin-ha was still alive
when she left her house.

145
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,959
Jul-pin's mom told me
that she heard the two of them fighting.

146
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,504
Do you think drugs only act
to make a person feel good?

147
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,590
It increases their impulsivity
and appetite for destruction too.

148
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,176
No.

149
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,386
I'm sure it's not like that.

150
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,846
Are you really that dumb?

151
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,306
What does that woman…

152
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,018
mean to you?

153
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,083
What are you doing here?

154
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,961
I'm here for my kids.

155
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,846
Mr. Kim Ju-seok,

156
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,767
Don't think that you're in the clear.

157
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,728
We're still investigating other crimes.

158
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,386
Hello, Yu-bin's father.

159
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,140
I'm here for my kids.
Please open the door.

160
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:55,436
I'm sorry but the kids are still sleeping.
Could you come back later?

161
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,563
What are you talking about?

162
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,231
Just open the door, please.

163
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,567
Yeong-bin!

164
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,111
Yu-bin! Let's go home.

165
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,988
Yu-bin!

166
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,074
Hello?

167
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,578
You might think I'm a total scumbag

168
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,331
but I'm not a bad person.

169
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,250
I still know enough
to hold my children precious!

170
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,002
Yu-bin!

171
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,630
-It's Dad! Yeong-bin, let's go home!
-Dad?

172
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,715
Yu-bin! It's Dad, Yu-bin!

173
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,969
-Dad!
-Yu-bin.

174
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,721
Where's your brother?

175
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,348
-Dad!
-Hey, Yeong-bin.

176
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,686
Put your shoes on. Let's go home.

177
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,065
-Let me get their jackets.
-Let's go.

178
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,608
Let's go home.

179
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,943
Wait…

180
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,032
I'm sorry for asking
to meet on such short notice.

181
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,868
I just have a few questions
I'd like to ask.

182
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,458
What time does Henry usually go to bed?

183
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,256
Sometime between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m.

184
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,342
I see…

185
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:14,223
And you never woke up once
while sleeping with Henry that day?

186
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:20,354
Then I guess you had no idea
until the morning…

187
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,523
that the incident occurred.

188
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,907
Didn't I already explain
everything to you?

189
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,950
You did.

190
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,118
But it's just that

191
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:39,164
we have a witness who testified
that you were awake at that time.

192
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,711
Why did you…

193
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,755
meet up with Ms. Byeon Chun-hui?

194
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,925
What were you trying to check?

195
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,770
You were already aware of
the fact that Ms. Byeon

196
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,523
was giving sedatives to Ms. Seo.

197
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,444
Why didn't you share
that fact with the police?

198
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,949
For my kid's sake.

199
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,703
I didn't want to reveal anything
about his mother's wrongdoings.

200
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,294
I'm saying that your friend's death

201
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,589
might be because of that woman.

202
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,721
PROFESSOR LEE YEONG-GUN

203
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,517
Hello, Professor.

204
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,518
Hey.

205
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,022
Did you sort out
that urgent matter from yesterday?

206
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,482
Yes.

207
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,194
I don't know what could be more important
than your work with me at the moment.

208
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,198
Either way, I hope you haven't forgotten
about today's meeting with professors.

209
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,866
I haven't.

210
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,828
On your way over, drop by the school
and pick me and Professor Park up.

211
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,249
And if you can, bring something nice
so they don't get their feelings hurt.

212
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,503
Yes, Professor.

213
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,879
Don't be late.

214
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,506
Yes, sir.

215
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,863
How are the kids?

216
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,284
Their father came and took them.

217
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:44,248
Yu-bin started crying as soon as
she heard her dad's voice.

218
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,878
I'm sorry.

219
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,840
No, it's fine.

220
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,010
Being with their dad is better
than being with someone else.

221
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,639
I…

222
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,144
forced you to bear such a heavy burden.

223
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,478
I'm sorry.

224
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,654
There's…

225
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,325
something I want to ask you.

226
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,542
My husband told me that

227
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,503
on the day that Jin-ha died,

228
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,965
you were there…

229
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,262
to give her an injection.

230
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,765
That's not true, is it?

231
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,894
He's mistaken, right?

232
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,877
So you've been
deceiving me this entire time?

233
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,838
Even though you knew
what I was going through?

234
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,431
I asked you so many times

235
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,433
about what happened that day!

236
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,482
I'm sorry.

237
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,236
I just…

238
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,495
couldn't bring myself to tell you.

239
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,626
I had no idea.

240
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,308
Is it also true…

241
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,439
that Jin-ha died because of
the injection that you gave her?

242
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,649
No.

243
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,736
Eun-pyo, that's not true at all.

244
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,658
She and I even had a long talk together
after she woke up.

245
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:28,120
I'm telling the truth.
She was completely fine.

246
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,373
Eun-pyo, I…

247
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,459
I…

248
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,672
I wasn't able to tell you this until now,

249
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,969
but there was something
very strange about her husband.

250
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,973
I saw it clearly.

251
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,934
I saw that he was awake.

252
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,729
But then…

253
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,066
he told everyone that he had no idea
what happened because he was sleeping.

254
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,529
It even seemed like he was aware
that I was giving her the injections.

255
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,823
And despite all that,

256
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,952
he never filed a report
and just tried to cover everything up.

257
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,461
I'm sorry.

258
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,422
This is too much for me right now.

259
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,091
I'll come back another time.

260
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,259
Eun-pyo.

261
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,178
Eun-pyo!

262
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:51,119
The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a message after the tone.

263
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:02,464
SECRETARY KIM PHARM DE LYON

264
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,333
Excuse me.

265
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,962
You…

266
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,511
Who…

267
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:33,763
Who are you?

268
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,057
I'm sorry.

269
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,853
I think you have the wrong person.

270
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,821
Wait!

271
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,619
Wait, there's something
I needed to ask you.

272
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,755
I'm sorry,

273
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,342
but do you happen to know Seo Jin-ha?

274
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,427
No.

275
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,513
Do I look that much like someone you know?

276
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,475
Well, yes.

277
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,103
You look so much like this friend of mine.

278
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,565
I'm sorry for making you
feel uncomfortable.

279
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,777
Don't worry, it happens.

280
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,154
The world is a big place after all.

281
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,722
Hold on!

282
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:09,901
Rhéa…

283
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,779
Rhéa Benuel.

284
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,949
Louis…

285
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,868
Louis Benuel?

286
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,665
How are they related?

287
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:29,838
The title of the book is
An Adoptee, the Eternal Stranger.

288
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,008
The reasons why I'm writing this book…

289
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,385
I want to comfort my sister,

290
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,596
who's grieving the loss of her parents.

291
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,106
PROFESSOR LEE YEONG-GUN

292
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,232
Hey, Eun-pyo.

293
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,693
I forgot to mention this earlier,

294
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,488
but you know that wine bar
I like right in front of the school?

295
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,534
They recently received a big shipment
of some great wine from France.

296
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,662
Why don't you go over there
and buy about ten bottles of wine?

297
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:06,374
While you're at it, pick out a bottle
for each other professors too, will you?

298
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,919
I'm sorry, Professor.

299
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:13,173
I don't think
I'll be able to make it tonight.

300
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,508
What's this bizarre nonsense?

301
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,969
I already talked
to all of the other professors.

302
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,014
I'm really sorry, Professor.

303
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,392
There's something urgent
that I need to take care of.

304
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,813
Are you trying to let me down again?

305
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,317
Lee Eun-pyo, mark my words.

306
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,486
If you don't keep your promise today,

307
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,072
consider our relationship over.

308
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,281
Do you think that's all?

309
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,242
You'll never be able to show your face
around Geoseong University ever again.

310
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,327
Do you understand?

311
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,498
I'm sorry,

312
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,584
but no matter
how many times I reconsider it,

313
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:53,129
my other obligation is more urgent to me.

314
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,173
Listen here, Lee Eun-pyo!

315
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,400
Hey, Dad.

316
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,317
Yes?

317
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,028
Aren't you going to the hospital today?

318
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,907
I'm on break, so it's fine.

319
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,659
Eat up.

320
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,541
When can we see mom?

321
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,710
You'll see her soon.

322
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,212
Eat up.

323
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,059
MR. LEE MAN-SU

324
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,485
What did you want to see me for, Mr. Lee?

325
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,989
I heard Ms. Byeon Chun-hui
was arrested by the police.

326
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,907
Damn it.

327
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,492
Where did you hear that?

328
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,329
Then have you also heard
she's going to be given

329
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,749
a harsher sentence
because of her past record?

330
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,918
So?

331
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,254
You should testify
if you want to shorten her sentence.

332
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,798
The statute of limitations
for that expired.

333
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,301
Wait.

334
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,013
What are you yapping about right now?

335
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,097
Are you high?

336
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,349
Who are you to mind
other people's business?

337
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,894
Are you Chun-hui's boyfriend or something?

338
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,611
Hey.

339
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,197
Are you really her boyfriend?

340
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,700
Damn.

341
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:50,205
No wonder why she's been
dying to get a divorce.

342
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:55,919
Byeon Chun-hui and I don't have
that kind of relationship that you think.

343
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,378
If not that, then what is it?

344
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,007
What the hell is it supposed to be then?

345
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,510
Hey, punk.

346
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,138
How can a lame salesman
like you flirt with a doctor's wife?

347
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,558
And as if that's not enough,
you're acting like her boyfriend?

348
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,561
This is all your fault, punk.

349
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,064
It's all your fault.

350
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,234
What are you going to do, punk?

351
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,695
-This is all because of you, bastard!
-You damn coward!

352
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:29,035
She went through all of that
just to make things work with you.

353
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,247
Does that not make you feel anything?

354
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,663
Damn it.

355
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,463
Damn it.

356
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,226
PRINT LOCATION

357
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:53,036
I dedicate this book to my sister Rhéa,
who kept me safe during my childhood,

358
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,999
and my son, Henry,
who keeps me safe in the present.

359
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,336
And with that, I was adopted
to France from Korea.

360
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:07,175
At the home I was adopted into,
there was already another Asian child.

361
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,844
She had been adopted before me.

362
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,680
She was a Chinese adoptee
and her name was Rhéa.

363
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:18,019
As Antoine entered puberty
he began to rebel.

364
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,689
He wanted to know why his family
had to suffer because of the adoptees.

365
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,150
It was no secret that he hated us.

366
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,904
She loved us, of course,

367
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:32,825
but it broke her heart that her own son
wasn't getting all of the love he needed.

368
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,872
Rhéa and I had no choice
but to rely on each other.

369
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,882
RHÉA AND I…

LOUIS BENUEL

377
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,018
It's me, Louis.

378
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,563
I'd like it if we could meet up.

379
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:30,485
Rhéa told me that she ran into someone
who seemed to know her.

380
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:36,449
When she said that the person knew
how to speak French, I knew it was you.

381
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:41,037
I figured I needed to explain myself.

382
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,748
That's why I called you.

383
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,883
AN ADOPTEE, THE ETERNAL STRANGER

384
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,219
Is this why…

385
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,722
you married Jin-ha?

386
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,975
Because she looked just like her?

387
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,400
Now it all makes sense.

388
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,446
Both Jin-ha and I…

389
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,324
were just replacements for her.

390
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,452
Don't say that.

391
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,705
Did Jin-ha know?

392
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,999
Is that why she was suffering?

393
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,085
Is that why she wanted to kill herself?

394
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,878
How could you cause

395
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,339
that much pain to a person?

396
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:39,095
It's common for people to marry someone
who looks like their first love.

397
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,765
Is that really something
you can blame me for?

398
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,034
Yes, I admit it.

399
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,203
All of this is my fault.

400
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,249
Jin-ha was suffering because of that.

401
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:14,005
That's happened to her.

402
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,383
That night…

403
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,720
you were with Jin-ha, right?

404
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,520
You're…

405
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,106
hiding something.

406
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,318
What are you talking about?

407
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,614
Why were you trying
to cover everything up?

408
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,032
Why did you lie?

409
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,952
Even when all those pictures of Jin-ha
were going around on the internet,

410
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,413
-you said not to keep looking into it!
-Stop it!

411
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,459
Do you have any idea
what kind of hell my life was?

412
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,922
People like you who have everything
would never know.

413
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,510
Do you have any idea
what kind of pain we shared?

414
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,814
You pushed her, didn't you?

415
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,155
You killed her

416
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,367
because you wanted to be with that woman.

417
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,827
Right?

418
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,006
-Where are you going?
-Let go!

419
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,676
Let go of me!

420
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:17,461
It was also painful
for me to come this far.

421
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,258
You and I used to be in love.

422
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,723
Is it too much for me to ask you
to wish for my happiness?

423
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,601
Where's Dad?

424
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,604
You're up?

425
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,607
I'm sorry. It must be too bright for you.

426
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,284
He stepped outside for a moment.

427
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,578
If there's anything you need,
just let me know.

428
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,623
Why am I at the hospital?

429
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,503
If you look right here,

430
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,713
there's something called the appendix.

431
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,716
That part was having
a hard time so you got surgery.

432
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,344
You did a good job, little man.

433
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,682
But…

434
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,477
why do you look so much like my mom?

435
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,232
I'm not sure.

436
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,279
Maybe even God
makes mistakes from time to time.

437
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,657
Is that why…

438
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,034
my mom was in so much pain?

439
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,748
Tell me

440
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,500
what happened that day.

441
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,962
I want to know everything.

442
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,756
No.

443
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,509
I need to know.

444
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,021
I received a phone call.

445
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,774
It was our first customer

446
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,236
and they said it seemed like
she was new to this kind of thing,

447
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,823
so I should be careful.

448
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,620
But the person who opened
the door to the hotel room

449
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,415
was Henry's mother.

450
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,090
From that day on,

451
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:13,012
she'd find every excuse to call me

452
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,556
even though

453
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,643
I told her
I wasn't going to do it anymore.

454
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,229
She was reckless.

455
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,864
On that day,

456
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,783
Henry's mother…

457
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,245
cried a lot.

458
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,873
Now that I think about it,

459
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:46,587
it was all her sadness
that just came out at once.

460
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,131
But…

461
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,968
I could barely handle my own situation.

462
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,806
So I didn't want to listen to her.

463
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,653
Are you up?

464
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,616
The pineapple…

465
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,791
Eun-pyo's mom…

466
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,461
only gave the pineapple

467
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,798
to Eun-pyo.

468
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,138
She would let me

469
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,017
lay on her lap

470
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,188
and she would pat my head.

471
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,816
But all of a sudden…

472
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,652
she said I'm someone else's child.

473
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,036
You smell like a mom, ma'am.

474
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,456
Are you sure it's not the smell of paint?

475
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,337
She was so nice to me.

476
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,048
It really…

477
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,095
felt like I had a mom.

478
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,431
It was so nice.

479
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,144
But…

480
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,149
she was lying the entire time.

481
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,653
Whenever I thought of that,

482
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,115
right here…

483
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,661
my heart

484
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,124
would sting from the pain.

485
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,881
When I saw her
for the first time in 20 years,

486
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,013
she couldn't even recognize me.

487
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,479
But Eun-pyo…

488
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,486
doesn't know how special
what she has truly is.

489
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,034
Even though it was her who hurt me first,

490
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,872
she asked me if I have a mental problem.

491
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,169
She said I was as sly as a snake.

492
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:40,678
Is it true?

493
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,015
Am I…

494
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,768
that strange?

495
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:53,482
Am I that strange?

496
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,150
Am I…

497
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:01,115
Am I really that strange?

498
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,452
Tell me.

499
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:10,374
Am I really that strange?

500
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,712
Henry's mother was bawling her eyes out.

501
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,008
But I cast her to the side and left.

502
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,021
And after that,

503
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,483
you have no idea…

504
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,654
how hard it was for me too.

505
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,407
I wanted to do anything I could…

506
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,952
to deny it.

507
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,080
But if there was any chance…

508
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:59,006
that Henry's mother died because of me,

509
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:04,052
what then?

510
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,309
I was so scared and drained.

511
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,939
I'm sorry, Eun-pyo.

512
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,776
VISITING ROOM

513
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,562
Gosh, you didn't even call.

514
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,407
It is said that since a long time ago,

515
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,410
couples secretly used to come here
to enjoy their time together.

516
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,413
When couples come here
and kiss each other…

517
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,915
Goodness.

518
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:19,628
Your sister-in-law said that one
of the parents brought this as a present.

519
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,547
Try some, it's good.

520
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,966
Also, this place has a wonderful nickname.

521
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:27,219
It's called Venice of France
and it's also…

522
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,724
What's going on?

523
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,137
What is it
that's making you cry like this?

524
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,557
I just feel so pathetic.

525
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,893
I'm so embarrassed.

526
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,648
Of what?

527
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,497
Mom…

528
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,402
Did you just wake up?

529
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,707
Get some more sleep.
It's still early in the morning.

530
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,918
Dad.

531
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,921
On that day,

532
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,799
it happened around this time too, right?

533
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,176
Dad!

534
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,886
No, Dad!

535
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,764
Not you too, Dad!

536
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:23,145
I was never going to say anything.

537
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,523
It's all my fault!

538
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,736
I'm sorry.

539
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,573
Not you too, Dad.

540
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:15,572
LOUIS BENUEL

541
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:20,327
LOUIS BENUEL

542
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,591
It's been…

543
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,761
too much for me.

544
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:25,183
I kept on telling myself
that I had no other choice

545
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,310
and fooling myself

546
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,397
that it was all coincidence.

547
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,322
-Hey, Dong-sik.
-Yes?

548
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,574
You collected all the electronics
that were on the scene, right?

549
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,451
Yes, of course.

550
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,411
Was there a laptop or not?

551
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,246
There wasn't.

552
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:32,167
Then why is there a laptop charger
plugged into the power strip?

553
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,129
Hey, Hyeok-ho, the laptop…

554
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,720
Hyeok-ho, check the man's whereabouts.

555
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,096
Dong-sik, hurry and get the car ready.

556
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,015
-Check his flight records too!
-Yes, sir!

557
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,183
Come on, hurry!

558
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:55,023
My parents passed away
last year in an accident.

559
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:59,611
And I was reunited with Rhéa…

560
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,821
for the first time in 20 years.

561
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,532
For God created us to be imperishable,

562
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:08,244
and made us
and image of his own eternity.

563
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,247
The souls of the righteous…

564
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,501
We immediately knew
that we had missed each other.

565
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,839
In the eyes of the foolish…

566
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,883
Rhéa, it's me.

567
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,720
I just wanted to ask if you knew of
any publishers here in France.

568
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:29,849
I kept contacting her,
using the book as an excuse.

569
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:35,146
HAVE YOU STILL NOT MADE UP YOUR MIND?
I'M READY TO BE WITH YOU

570
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:38,984
I tried to convince her.

571
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:40,986
Every day.

572
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,031
And one day…

573
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,368
No, come back to me.

574
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,998
I finally got the answer
I had been waiting for.

575
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,592
Rhéa?

576
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,344
It's me.

577
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,512
Thanks.

578
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,098
I don't know.

579
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:14,352
Are you making fun of me?

580
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,814
No, I can't.

581
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,107
But…

582
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,359
after getting a positive response,

583
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,780
I wasn't sure how to convince Jin-ha.

584
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,035
But in any case,

585
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,539
I shouldn't have left her like that.

586
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,061
Was this the reason?

587
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:02,734
I'm sorry.

588
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,444
But…

589
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,821
you have to let me go.

590
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,600
I…

591
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,105
I understand everything now, Honey.

592
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:45,151
I couldn't figure out why it felt like
I was living with an empty shell.

593
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:46,861
I thought…

594
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,365
I was the strange one.

595
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,077
I tried all different types of medication
and I even went to therapy.

596
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,246
I tried practically everything.

597
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,500
Now I know

598
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,837
that my intuition was right.

599
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,381
Wasn't it?

600
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,268
Jin-ha!

601
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,384
It's dangerous!

602
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,327
Why are you doing this?

603
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,954
Why?

604
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,418
I think I knew…

605
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,465
since a long time ago

606
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,468
that this was going to happen.

607
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:40,517
I was so afraid that I might die
just like my mother did.

608
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,644
But now…

609
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,106
I'm afraid that I might end up

610
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,943
living like her.

611
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,078
Just…

612
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,665
let me do what I want to do.

613
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:07,961
Or…

614
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,257
whatever it is that you want me to do.

615
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,973
-Hey, over there.
-What?

616
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,729
Damn it.

617
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,193
What's up?

618
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,112
Jae-ung.

619
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,239
Louis Benuel…

620
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,825
is at the station right now.

621
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:22,535
What?

622
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,918
He says he wants to turn himself in.

623
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,513
But…

624
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:45,433
why do you want to reveal the truth

625
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,519
all of a sudden?

626
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,274
I'm not supposed to be happy…

627
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,153
By leaving Henry all alone…

628
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,782
we deserve this hell.

629
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:27,016
Hello.

630
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,396
Is there anything you're looking for?

631
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,568
Hey, is that all you can do?

632
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,653
Use your feet more.

633
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:06,032
See? I can swing much higher than you.

634
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,743
What? No, I can swing higher than you.

635
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,536
What?

636
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,330
Then try jumping.

637
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,540
I'm sure I can jump further.

638
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,833
Sure, let's try.

639
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,627
Then let's jump off together.

640
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:22,340
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

641
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:46,280
They say it's hard to
really get to know a person.

642
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,079
Can she come out for the funeral?

643
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,791
I read online that it's hard

644
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:59,961
for inmates to come out
unless it's a special circumstance.

645
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:02,588
I'm not sure.

646
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,361
Wait.

647
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,448
Hyeok-ho, give me the keys.

648
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,501
Yun-ju.

649
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,510
How have you been?

650
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,144
I just…

651
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:47,813
The thing is…

652
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,567
There's something I haven't
had the chance to say to you.

653
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:53,736
I wanted to say…

654
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,198
that I'm sorry.

655
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:03,329
I'm sorry that you met a guy like me
and went through so much hardship.

656
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:09,043
I'm sorry that I've given you
so much pain because of my past.

657
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,879
You might not believe it,

658
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,299
but I never once regretted
getting married to you.

659
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,384
I've always been grateful.

660
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:18,385
And…

661
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,347
The fact that you and Su-in

662
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:26,060
are the two most important people
in my life hasn't changed.

663
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:29,480
As for Su-in…

664
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:35,694
Never mind, I should get going.

665
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,341
Chun-hui!

666
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:15,860
It's going to be okay.

667
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:19,530
Everything will get better.

668
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,200
I'll go visit you.

669
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,661
Take care of yourself, okay?

670
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,354
Is there good news or something?

671
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:34,855
Why are you smiling like that?

672
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,732
-What's going on?
-Come inside.

673
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:39,193
-I really hope I win this one!
-What?

674
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,862
I spun it wrong.

675
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,530
Now it's my turn, right?

676
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,285
I'm going to lose! No!

677
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:51,038
-It's spinning so fast. Come on!
-No!

678
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:53,749
-I won! Come on!
-No!

679
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,793
Right before it stops!

680
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:58,671
Come on!

681
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,548
I won!

682
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:04,802
-Oh, no!
-I won!

683
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:07,638
-How do you do that, Dong-seok?
-He copied me!

684
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:08,806
Watch this.

685
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:13,394
If you hold it really hard right here,
then it spins even faster.

686
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:14,478
Really?

687
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:20,109
Look at this, I have so many flowers.

688
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:23,654
Guys, today I have something
really fun planned for us.

689
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:24,780
-All right.
-What is it?

690
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:26,740
What does this look like to you?

691
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,033
-Onions.
-Onions.

692
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,118
-Garlic.
-Radishes.

693
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:30,244
-Radishes?
-A pumpkin.

694
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:31,829
-A carrot?
-I can see peppers too.

695
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:33,747
Peppers? You're right.

696
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:37,209
Then what if I do this?

697
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,628
-My gosh!
-It's a fat man.

698
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:40,754
-A grandpa.
-An old man.

699
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:43,173
It turned into a face, didn't it?

700
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:46,552
-Then about this one?
-An old man with flowers!

701
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,305
Right? His hair is made up of flowers.

702
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:52,016
-Yes.
-Why don't we use

703
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:54,310
the ingredients in front of us
to make some human faces?

704
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:55,978
-Okay.
-All right.

705
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:04,278
YE-SEUL USED A VARIETY OF INGREDIENTS

706
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:11,327
TO MAKE A HUMAN FACE

707
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:20,419
-See you later.
-Bye.

708
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:21,879
-Right, Man-su.
-Yes?

709
01:12:21,962 --> 01:12:25,507
You know that ox bone soup
restaurant right by your office?

710
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:28,218
Can you grab two orders on your way home?
Su-in loves that.

711
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,303
All right.

712
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:31,930
They charge for plastic bags there.

713
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:32,973
Hold on.

714
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:34,933
What are you looking for?

715
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,060
Grocery bag.

716
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:37,144
This?

717
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,690
Gosh, what a good husband.

718
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:43,734
See you later.

719
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:45,235
Honey.

720
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,905
-Can I buy some beers too?
-Sure.

721
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,366
-See you later.
-See you later.

722
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,457
TO: LEE EUN-PYO

723
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:09,551
BROCCOLI'S HOMEMADE JAM WORKSHOP

724
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,606
JUL-PIN'S MOM

725
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,901
Did it arrive safely? Nothing was cracked?

726
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:27,694
Yes, everything arrived safely.

727
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:32,032
I thought I only ordered ten.
There's one extra that came with it.

728
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:33,951
Oh, that?

729
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:36,829
I added one extra jar for you,
Dong-seok's mom.

730
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,373
Thanks to you, I've been getting
so many orders from Sangwe-dong.

731
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:41,542
I've been so busy
keeping up with the orders.

732
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:45,212
Oh, please. I'm sure word got around
about how delicious your jam is.

733
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:49,591
When did you get so good at making jams?

734
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,301
Oh, the thing is…

735
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:55,722
As you know, when it comes to cooking,

736
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:59,601
it depends on how much love and care
the cook imbues into her food,

737
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,728
as well as her willingness
to use plenty of ingredients.

738
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,815
Of course, a good sense of
moral responsibility for food.

739
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:09,278
Also, countless nights of research…

740
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,737
I have a customer.

741
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:12,698
-I'll call you again later.
-All right.

742
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,491
Hello.

743
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:16,743
Welcome, come on in.

744
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:18,203
-I wonder what's good today.
-Hey, Ji-yeon.

745
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,956
I'm still in the middle of
making the strawberry jam.

746
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:23,876
What should we do?
Do you want to try the fig jam?

747
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,548
Eun-pyo, are you ready?

748
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:30,632
Yes.

749
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:34,344
Let's go.

750
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:35,888
That's more than ten years of difference.

751
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,599
-So her dad goes to her, to his daughter…
-Hello.

752
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,225
-Come in.
-Hello.

753
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,936
So even though there's
an age gap of 18 years, it's no big deal.

754
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,771
And they opened it
because he has the money.

755
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:48,192
Hey, what are we
all gossiping about so seriously?

756
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:51,445
There's a new octopus restaurant
right at the intersection.

757
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:52,946
-I see.
-It's incredible.

758
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,989
Goodness.

759
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:57,493
Su-in's dad loves octopuses.
I better go check it out.

760
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:59,745
-Where was it?
-In front of the bank.

761
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:00,787
You have to go.

762
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:03,499
Even if you hate octopuses,
you still have to go, you know?

763
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,418
It's where you'll learn
what real octopuses taste like.

764
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:10,380
I'm pretty sure the chef had some
experience studying abroad.

765
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:14,134
Because it tastes super similar
to the octopus I ate when I visited Italy.

766
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:15,719
When you go to Italy,

767
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:19,223
they have an entire street dedicated
to octopuses all along the beach.

768
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:22,601
When you go there
they have these divers, right?

769
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:25,437
They were all guys,
so maybe I should call them diver men?

770
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,022
They do!

771
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:29,775
Hello, I don't think
I've seen you around before.

772
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,530
Hello, I'm Nam Jun-yong's mother.
We recently switched schools.

773
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,615
Oh, I see.

774
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,992
I'm Jung Dong-seok's mother.

775
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,286
Does he have any siblings?

776
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,039
He has one younger brother
who's seven years old.

777
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:45,249
Really?

778
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,668
My youngest is also seven.

779
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,754
I guess they'll be starting school
together next year.

780
01:15:50,837 --> 01:15:53,173
You should come to our place.

781
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:56,385
It'll be easier to get used to
the neighborhood if they make friends.

782
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:58,011
Really?

783
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:01,640
My kids are so worked up
because they don't have any friends.

784
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:04,142
So I want to help them
make some new friends.

785
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:07,563
But everyone's already
so close with each other.

786
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:13,151
The other people don't seem to be
too interested in new students at all.

787
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,404
You're a very kind person.

788
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:18,824
When I first got here,

789
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:23,495
I had one friend who helped me
get adjusted wholeheartedly.

790
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,498
It was thanks to her
that I managed to adjust or else…

791
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:27,541
I see.

792
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,585
Where is that friend now?

793
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:34,047
She lives somewhere else now.

794
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:35,007
I see.

795
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:42,973
Hello.

796
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:45,434
Welcome, Dong-seok's mom.

797
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:48,061
Why are you only buying
sliced bread today?

798
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,814
I got some delicious jam,
so I'm going to enjoy it with my bread.

799
01:16:50,897 --> 01:16:53,108
If you pop it
into the microwave for a bit,

800
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:54,651
-it'll taste even better.
-Okay.

801
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,987
You know that we make our bread
with the same ingredients

802
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,281
that Seoul Hotel
gets supplied with, right?

803
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:00,324
Of course.

804
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:01,950
It's all organic and it's only 5,300 won.

805
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,535
I hear you.

806
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:09,499
-There you go.
-Thank you.

807
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:43,784
Chun-hui?

808
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:13,271
How have you been, Eun-pyo?

809
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,275
I missed you.

810
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:19,695
I missed you too.

811
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,231
Cheers!

812
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:26,780
