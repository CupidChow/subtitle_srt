1
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,070
You've all heard of it before, right?

2
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,489
The term "Salieri Syndrome."

3
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,699
It's a psychological term

4
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,912
for when a person has a crippling
inferiority complex in regard to another.

5
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,371
INTRO TO AESTHETICS

6
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,708
Is there anyone who knows
where this term comes from?

7
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,126
Amadeus.

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,128
That's right. It's from the movie Amadeus.

9
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,090
I haven't gotten to know you yet,
but I guess you're an older student.

10
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:40,141
Then can anyone tell me
what the movie Amadeus is about?

11
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,773
It's based on a true story

12
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,693
about a man
who was jealous of Mozart, Salieri.

13
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,781
One of Salieri's lines in the movie
goes something like this.

14
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,574
"God."

15
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,245
"You choose for your instrument

16
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,125
a boastful, lustful, smutty, infantile boy

17
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,087
and give me for reward only the ability
to recognize the incarnation."

18
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:15,301
Now, there are people
who make careers out of this ability.

19
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,178
Who could they be?

20
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,764
They are critics.

21
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,851
It's a heartbreaking profession, isn't it?

22
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,356
If Salieri had been born today,

23
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,817
he probably would've become
a household name…

24
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,781
thanks to his sharp eye for talent.

25
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,760
The study of Aesthetics
is a fascinating field

26
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,138
where you'll learn to nurture
that kind of eye.

27
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,650
So, this semester,

28
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,236
we're going to start by taking a look

29
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,490
at Forty Answers About the Arts
from Mingyeong Publishing House

30
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,242
for our introductory class.

31
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,962
What happened?

32
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,511
Everyone left.

33
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,813
So…

34
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,149
Why did you do it?

35
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,779
You…

36
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,366
never stood a chance against me.

You have debate lessons today,
so don't forget to pack your print-offs.

42
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,094
Wake up already.

43
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,645
Come on, sit down.

00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,120
I told you to keep the door open.
You can't hear anything.

46
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,415
I have to go to Green,
so take Yu-bin to school with you.

47
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,668
Yu-bin, go to school
with your brother later.

48
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,753
Okay.

49
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,855
Mom.

50
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,358
Don't you think
these clothes are too small?

51
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,277
Stylish people usually
wear clothes that fit them perfectly.

52
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,577
Su-in, this is Pierre.

53
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,247
You have no idea
what it took me to get you this.

54
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,584
You look absolutely lovely to me.

55
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,919
Come here, take a seat.

56
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,796
I've got Green today so I have to run.

57
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,144
It's time to eat.

58
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,280
Come on.

59
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,284
Didn't I make it clear
that everyone must finish their broccoli?

60
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,452
Why haven't you touched it?

61
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,664
I told you how important it was
to get your eating habits, didn't I?

62
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,334
Here, eat up.

63
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,836
I have to go to Green.

64
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,130
There you go. Sae-bom, you too.

65
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,673

NOT ALL NEIGHBORS ARE GOOD NEIGHBORS

92
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,746
Okay, lift it up!

93
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,795
Jeez, it's hot.

94
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,553
Hello.

95
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,069
Some say that this neighborhood, Sangwe,

96
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,239
is home to all
of the brightest rising stars.

97
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,365
Indeed.

98
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,202
When I heard that it was right on
Gangnam's heels in terms of education,

99
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,248
I expected a big turn-out,
but not as big as this.

100
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,378
The quality of education is guaranteed
without having to go to a private school.

101
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,173
I heard that's why everyone's
been moving in. Is that right?

102
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,800
-Yes.
-Am I right?

103
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,885
-Yes.
-Yes.

104
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:41,844
Now…

105
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,764
not to rain on anyone's parade,

106
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:51,395
but a child's ability to study
basically comes down to genetics.

107
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,691
I hope I didn't hurt anyone's feelings.

108
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,193
Did I hurt your feelings?

109
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,112
I didn't hurt your feelings, right?

110
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,909
However, the good news is,

111
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:09,663
even though genetics
used to account for 80% to 90% of grades,

112
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,584
these days it's barely breaking 50%.

113
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:17,838
As long as the mom makes an effort,
she has a chance of changing things.

114
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,006
-That's right.
-That's right.

115
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,383
So then, how?

116
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:23,928
All right.

117
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,388
Lee Se-dol and Son Yeol-eum.

118
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,642
What do you think was the key
to their success?

119
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,935
Anyone have the answer?

120
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,066
They started early.

121
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,943
STARTED AT THE AGE OF 5

122
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,988
Practice is how children
naturally build up their confidence.

123
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,243
People say not to force the kids
and that studying is not everything.

124
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,120
But if you teach them
not to compete in a competitive society,

125
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,540
who's going to take responsibility
when they fall behind?

126
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,916
-Who's responsible?
-This is Jul-pin's mother.

127
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,294
I came here to get some information
as the mother of the class president,

128
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,090
but it's all about early education
and they're robbing the children's rights.

129
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,092
What do you think?

130
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,929
Our goal is to create an environment
that provides an opportunity

131
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,348
for the highest quality education
for all students.

132
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,685
Education where everyone
starts on the same foot.

133
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,811
I'm not too sure.

134
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,355
I think it's a lot
more practical than the other talks

135
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,566
where they're overly idealistic.

136
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,237
We'll implement a teaching system
that allows for intensive learning.

137
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,323
Also, we're using cutting-edge…

138
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,660
Do you really think this is practical?

139
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,372
What he's saying is right though.

140
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,416
There are some things
we just have to make them do.

141
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:42,506
This is a perversion of the educational
system masquerading as a talk.

142
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,175
I'm going to bring this to the principal.

143
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,265
I'm going to thank the principal.

144
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,561
Don't twist things to make it seem
like you speak for all of us.

145
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,355
We will provide
the necessary training for teachers

146
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,233
and they will be assigned to their classes

147
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,777
based on what each school wants
from its students…

148
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,531
Why does the speaker's hair look so thick?
Are they transplants or a wig?

149
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:13,203
And the ability for children
to understand artificial intelligence.

150
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,625
Therefore, an education system
that supports our children

151
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,837
to be independent is done
by providing various types of lectures

152
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,423
based on each theme and balanced lectures…

153
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,176
Sorry, I sent it to the wrong chat.

154
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,095
Also, we'll be supporting

155
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,682
the training of teachers
that aim for the growth of students.

156
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,036
Ma'am.

157
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:01,168
I got rid of most of the stuff,
but what should I do with the bookshelf?

158
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,096
It'd be a waste to simply toss it out.

159
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,682
Should we try and sell it second-hand?

160
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,543
Did you say your goodbyes to them both?

161
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,920
Yes.

162
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,340
Where are they buried?

163
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,136
The Parisian cemetery of Pantin.

164
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,014
Maybe…

165
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,642
Henry and I should've gone
with you as well.

166
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:05,733
No, I was busy clearing things up
after the accident.

167
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,111
MONDE DU PAIN BAKERY

168
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,659
The door is closing.

169
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,998
Ma'am, should these go
in the master bedroom?

170
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,043
No, don't put those there.
Please put them in the study.

171
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,900
Ma'am, the plates…

172
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,154
-I'll put them up here.
-Okay.

173
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,282
But can you wipe them
before putting them away?

174
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,909
Sure.

175
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,592
Hello, I thought you might be busy
with your move,

176
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,636
so I left you a broom and some rags.

177
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,472
Here are some tips
that you might find helpful.

178
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,517
For bread, go to Monde Du Pain,
right across from our block.

179
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,977
The bakery on our block
really isn't up to snuff.

180
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,523
As for a pediatrician, cross the street
and look for Min Jae-hui Pediatrics.

181
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,608
The doctor is friendly.

182
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,195
The only thing you really need to
look out for is Yu-bin's mom.

183
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,864
Please toss this post-it note
in the trash.

184
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,581
Eun-pyo.

185
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,583
Eun-pyo.

186
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,253
-It's been so long!
-Did you just get here?

187
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,421
Goodness, Eun-pyo.

188
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,590
Your place is so nice.

189
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,967
Oh, my gosh.

190
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,057
This place is so nice.

191
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,143
It's amazing.

192
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,398
You should've at least
redone the wallpaper.

193
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,693
Then again.

194
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:16,238
You should be thanking your mother-in-law
for the money you moved in with.

195
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,120
What do you think of the neighborhood?

196
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,997
It's all right.

197
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,333
I like that the school
is right in front of our block.

198
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,794
That's it?

199
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,296
Yes.

200
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,300
There are moms waiting for a chance
to move into this neighborhood.

201
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,135
Jeez, there's no way that's it.

202
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,637
Tell me the truth.

203
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,098
Aren't you here for your kids' education?

204
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,934
No, I'm not.

205
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,064
Liar.

206
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,071
People from all those good schools
like you are the really scary ones.

207
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,742
They pretend like they
prepared nothing for their kids,

208
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,577
but really they have everything prepared.

209
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,830
You know what I hate the most?

210
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,416
Moms that push their dreams
onto their kids.

211
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,668
A kid's a kid, and I'm me.

212
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,255
As if it's really that easy.

213
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,049
My kid's me, and I'm my kid.

214
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,928
How's your mom doing?

215
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,555
I don't know. You know how my mom is.

216
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,433
She's always occupied
with her shop and home.

217
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,228
Ma'am, do you want these
in the master bedroom?

218
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,479
Yes.

219
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,858
It must've been hard watching the kids.

220
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,196
Thank you for everything.

221
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,241
I was able to move into
a nice neighborhood thanks to you.

222
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,743
I didn't do it for your own good.

223
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,375
Since we're on the topic,
let me tell you something.

224
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,253
I kept quiet because
you were preparing to become a professor,

225
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,171
but that's out of the picture now.

226
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,591
I can't let you do nothing
about my grandkids' education.

227
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:04,346
Do you think other moms focus
on their kids because they have no dreams?

228
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:10,644
Also, how many times did I tell you
to throw out all of those books?

229
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,897
The house looks like a shack.

230
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,565
Look at you.

231
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,859
You're so stubborn.

232
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,898
FORTY ANSWERS ABOUT THE ARTS
BY LEE SEUNG-HYEON

233
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,865
Hi, Mom.

234
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,366
You had a big day today.

235
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,493
Not at all.

236
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,746
The movers did everything for us.

237
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,331
-They did?
-Yes.

238
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,501
How's your knee?

239
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,128
It's all right.

240
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,340
Stop giving Jeong-u piggyback rides.

241
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,008
All right.

242
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,387
Did anyone call back from the university?

243
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,015
No.

244
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,560
Not even the professor?

245
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,312
It's over, Mom.

246
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,400
Don't get your hopes up anymore.

247
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,861
Rest up.

248
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,029
Okay.

249
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:26,530
GEOSEONG UNIVERSITY GRADUATE SCHOOL
DEPARTMENT OF FINE ARTS, LEE EUN-PYO

250
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,061
Hi, my name is Jung Dong-seok.
I hope we can all be friends.

251
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,565
All right, let's all be nice
to our new friend.

252
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,819
And help him out if there's anything
he doesn't know yet, okay?

253
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,155
-Okay.
-Okay.

254
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,741
You can sit next to Henry over there.

255
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,326
-Okay.
-All right.

256
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,079
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

257
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,039
-Hey.
-Hi.

258
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,750
Please take out your Korean textbooks.

259
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,627
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

260
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,131
MONDE DU PAIN BAKERY

261
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,638
Welcome.

262
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,143
I've let it go many times,

263
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,437
but don't you think this is too much?

264
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,939
Why do you think I come to your bakery?

265
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,902
It's because all of the ingredients
are supposed to be organic.

266
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,155
Then why does my child get hives
whenever they eat anything from here?

267
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:54,367
And now you're using walnuts
that have been around for so long.

268
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:01,124
Those are sourced from the same place
that Seoul Hotel gets theirs from.

269
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:05,086
We take very special care to make sure
we source the finest ingredients.

270
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,047
Your nitpicking is a bit ridiculous.

271
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,048
What?

272
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,549
Nitpicking?

273
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,136
It seems like people are
out on a witch hunt for shop owners

274
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,138
who haven't done anything wrong.

275
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,849
I'm not someone you want to mess with.

276
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,351
Look, lady.

277
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,812
If you want to grow your business,
you better take my advice

278
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,190
instead of finding a way to avoid it.

279
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,569
Who will believe that your product is
top-tier when your attitude is so bad?

280
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,165
Excuse me.

281
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,961
Could I ask you
to try a little bit of this?

282
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,591
You can be the judge of how this tastes

283
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,551
and whether or not

284
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,097
there's anything wrong with these walnuts.

285
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,768
Me?

286
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,396
Yes, please.

287
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,486
All right.

288
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,165
I…

289
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,837
Well…

290
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,755
I think

291
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,008
they taste fine.

292
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,217
Right?

293
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,552
Thank you.

294
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,138
-Can I ring this up for you?
-Yes.

295
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,810
Did you just move to the neighborhood?
I don't think we've met before.

296
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,854
-Yes.
-That'll be 8,000 won.

297
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,484
And this is on the house.

298
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,154
Thank you.

299
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,074
-There you go.
-Thank you.

300
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,160
Thank you for coming.

301
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,321
Which floor are you going up to?

302
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,115
The same floor.

303
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,709
I really thought it tasted fine.

304
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,129
I know I might've upset you,

305
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,132
but it's not in my personality to lie.

306
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:00,929
Or maybe we just tried different parts…

307
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,352
What is it?

308
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,439
Did you really think
I was going to chew you out?

309
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,743
Oh, you live right across the hall.

310
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,746
You moved in yesterday, right?

311
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,498
Yes.

312
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,459
I should've bought a small gift
and introduced myself.

313
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,171
Nobody does that anymore.
They just mind their own business.

314
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,048
Right.

315
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:42,011
It would be nice if you could
get rid of those books over there.

316
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,807
I'm sorry. It was so late yesterday…

317
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,114
That's one way to make a first impression.

318
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,492
-Gosh, that's way too funny.
-I know, right?

319
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,995
You know what, though?

320
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,956
I have something
even more shocking to tell you.

321
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:11,958
What is it?

322
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,918
That woman's daughter

323
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,463
is in the same class as ours.

324
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,089
Seriously?

325
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,181
To be honest, she's no joke.

326
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,433
She's a notorious helicopter mom

327
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,560
and she's married to a doctor.

328
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,229
Her eldest attends Geoseong University
School for Gifted Students.

329
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,606
While her daughter…

330
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,107
Hold on.

331
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,781
Take a look. This is her daughter,
Kim Yu-bin.

332
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,580
She's a real tiger mom.

333
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,873
Let's talk about…

334
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,418
The most important thing is you're
done for if you get on her wrong side.

335
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,004
You're done for.

336
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,216
That's ridiculous.

337
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,259
There is, at least amongst the moms.

338
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,262
But anyway,

339
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,516
apart from the goddess in the penthouse,
she's the most powerful one.

340
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,478
Who's the goddess?

341
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,355
You don't need to worry about her.

342
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,523
Anyway…

343
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,692
just come to the birthday party
and try to smooth things over with her.

344
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:25,156
Just do it. There's nothing good
about getting on her bad side.

345
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,160
By the way,

346
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,412
what is a school for gifted students?

347
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,207
You know…

348
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,461
you've studied for so many years
and you've never heard of it before?

349
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,882
Am I supposed to know everything?

350
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:43,883
Watch your step.

351
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,052
-Hello. Sure. Bye.
-Go on then.

352
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,858
Hey, it's me.

353
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,401
Did Su-in get home?

354
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,987
I don't know why Dong-seok isn't here yet.

355
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,407
Did you forget about the birthday party?

356
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,784
Dong-seok's here right now.

357
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,413
We're going to start our science lesson.
Head over this way.

358
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,164
-Okay.
-Okay.

359
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,389
Come in.

360
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,935
The clock is ticking.

361
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,731
Whichever team gets their ball to stay
in the air the longest will be the winner.

362
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,859
Group A, what principle
is your structure based on?

363
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,405
Group C, I like how you're using
the domino effect there.

364
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,825
-Eun-pyo.
-Hey.

365
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,993
How could you forget?

366
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,537
We don't have much time left.
Let's start wrapping up.

367
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,748
-What about the birthday present?
-A present?

368
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,920
That'll be 78,000 won.

369
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,087
What?

370
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,258
Sure.

371
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,641
Why won't this come out?

372
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:16,976
Thank you.

373
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,896
That's pretty expensive.

374
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,818
By the way, Yun-ju.

375
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,155
Later on, when you're with the other moms,

376
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,700
do you mind not talking about me?

377
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,993
What would I talk about?

378
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:38,039
You know, things about my university

379
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,916
or about my husband.

380
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,709
What about him?

381
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,628
That he's a cop?

382
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:47,382
To be honest,
Jae-ung arrested someone before we moved

383
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,801
and they constantly showed up at our door.

384
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:50,885
Oh, no.

385
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,931
So I figured it'd be better if people
didn't find out that he was a cop.

386
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,766
Sure.

387
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,936
Gosh, that could've been really dangerous.

388
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,270
All right, I understand.

389
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,652
Well, then.

390
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,781
Remember how I used to party
back when I was young?

391
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,742
-Can you keep that a secret for me?
-Sure.

392
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,620
Here you go.

393
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,831
-Thank you.
-Can I carry it?

394
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:24,002
Where can I go to get this wrapped?

395
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,587
You can get it wrapped over there.

396
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,922
Thank you.

397
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,049
Should I buy the card?

398
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,677
I feel like we should also get a card.

399
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,266
Jae-bin, have a bite of this
before you go.

400
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,225
Jae-bin!

401
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:43,062
-Gosh, he never listens to me.
-They really don't listen at all.

402
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,272
Henry.

403
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,565
-Oh, hello.
-Gosh, Henry.

404
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,191
-Hello.
-Hello.

405
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,401
-Welcome.
-Hello.

406
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,694
Hi.

407
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,696
-Hello.
-Hello.

408
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,035
I have some work to get done.
Can you look after my son?

409
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,661
Would that be okay?

410
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,831
-Of course, we're happy you came by.
-Sure thing.

411
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,867
Abracadabra, boom shakalaka!

412
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,411
Abracadabra, boom shakalaka!

413
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,088
She was a very smart student.

414
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:54,342
So my mom always compared the two of us.
That's why I used to hate her back then.

415
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,595
So, the two of you are cousins?

416
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:02,266
Well, we're technically second cousins,
but our family is so close to each other.

417
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,393
So we're basically like first cousins.

418
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,731
Then, where did you go to university?

419
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,361
Geoseong University.

420
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,404
Geoseong University.

421
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,907
-Stop.
-She must be really smart.

422
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,035
Geoseong University?

423
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,955
-Yu-bin's mom is here.
-She's finally here.

424
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,958
-You always make an entrance.
-Hello.

425
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,960
How did you find this magician?

426
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,337
-I did all my research.
-Gosh, you're the best.

427
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,549
-I told you, she's in a league of her own.
-Gosh, stop it.

428
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,466
What?

429
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:37,969
Hello.

430
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,637
Hello.

431
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,557
I didn't know our kids
were in the same class.

432
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,101
She graduated from Geoseong University.

433
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,523
Just something to consider.

434
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,527
Right, I was just telling her

435
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,072
that she has the coolest neighbor ever.
I told her she hit the jackpot.

436
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,115
Right?

437
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,326
By the look of the books
you were throwing out,

438
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,370
it looked like you majored in art.

439
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,497
Fine arts? Or theory?

440
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,418
Aesthetics.

441
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,421
Medicine?

442
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,882
-Aesthetics.
-I see.

443
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,886
The theses all looked recent.
Are you currently teaching?

444
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,930
Well…

445
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,685
Yes.

446
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:31,647
She's on the verge
of getting appointed as a professor.

447
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:36,027
You'll probably be a full professor
by next semester, right?

448
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,654
So you're a professor?

449
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,823
-She's a professor.
-Right.

450
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,367
Then I guess

451
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,120
you won't have to worry
about your children studying.

452
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,039
-Right.
-That's hardly the case.

453
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,668
Well, it's not like the old days anymore.
So always try your best to support them.

454
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,837
-Indeed, yes.
-Of course.

455
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,964
I told you time and time again

456
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,634
you can't let your guard down
in this neighborhood.

457
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,306
What are you doing for your kids' studies?

458
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,058
Have you looked into academies?

459
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,935
No.

460
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,103
I'm not that type of mother.

461
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,730
What type?

462
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,941
"That type of mother"?

463
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,902
Well, I mean…

464
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:22,615
I find it hard to force
my children to do this and that.

465
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,533
It doesn't match my personality.

466
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,828
Honestly, they're still in first grade

467
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,748
and if I send them
to after-school studies,

468
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,875
I feel like they'll be stressed.

469
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,753
And I think it has more to do
with a mother's greed.

470
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,840
Is that what you think?

471
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,681
What's the kid's name?

472
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,891
Jung Dong-seok.

473
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,226
Dong-seok.

474
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,645
Dong-seok must be a very lucky boy

475
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,523
to have such an open-minded mother.

476
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,692
I hope you have a good time.

477
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,445
-Let's go check on the kids.
-Yes. We left them alone for too long.

478
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,202
She's no joke.

479
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,039
-What is she saying?
-Is she insane?

480
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,672
Eun-pyo.

481
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,758
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

482
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,231
She has such a nice husband,
maybe we could all…

483
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,944
Hey, if I had to go somewhere,
I'd at least ask you once.

484
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,696
-Isn't that a close relationship?
-Stop it.

485
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:47,533
-So what do you think?
-That's enough.

486
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,703
Chun-hui.

487
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,914
Are you upset?

488
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,708
I mean,

489
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,754
all she ever did was study,
so she doesn't know the real world.

490
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,797
I barely even met with her

491
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,008
until she recently moved into the area.

492
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,218
-I see. Just recently?
-Yes.

493
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,138
All she did was study in university

494
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,932
so she doesn't have it
in her to read social cues, right?

495
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,225
Right.

496
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,311
Gosh, we were just trying to be nice

497
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,439
because she just moved in,
and she's acting completely unreasonable.

498
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,525
-Then she should at least be humble.
-Exactly.

499
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,404
How can she try to round up all of us
and treat us all like idiots?

500
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,822
I know.

501
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,245
Chun-hui,

502
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,707
did you find a team for Yu-bin
for the speaking competition?

503
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,545
I was just wondering,
but what do you think of my Su-in?

504
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,716
I mean, Su-in was the top student
on our block until we moved here.

505
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,802
What's Su-in's Lexile score?

506
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,429
Around 670?

507
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,931
I see.

508
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,724
I see.

509
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,560
That won't cut it, okay?

510
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,313
Even Jae-bin doesn't stand
a chance against Yu-bin.

511
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,941
Don't get ahead of yourself.

512
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,779
Why yes, of course.

513
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,657
Gosh, that was unreasonable of me.

514
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,867
Just forget about the whole thing.

515
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,915
-Did Henry's mom not come?
-She was here.

516
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,292
But she said she was busy
and just dropped off her kid.

517
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,253
I see.

518
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:28,134
All right, we're going to celebrate
Min-ji's happy birthday now.

519
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:31,512
Miss Yu-bin will be performing the violin.

520
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,973
Everyone, please give
a big round of applause.

521
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,393
Break a leg, Yu-bin!

522
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,658
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MIN-JI

523
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,873
-What's going on?
-What?

524
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,082
What is that?

525
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,085
-What's going on?
-What?

526
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,754
-Jung Dong-seok, turn the lights off!
-What?

527
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,428
-What's wrong with him?
-Seriously, what's wrong with him?

528
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,805
Turn the lights off!

529
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,891
-Turn them off!
-Turn the lights off!

530
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,642
-What's wrong with him?
-Turn it off!

531
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,229
I'm so sorry. Follow me.

532
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,567
-Get out of here!
-Get out!

533
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,990
What is he doing?

534
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,827
We're going home now.

535
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,538
No. Why am I the only one leaving?

536
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,499
Then stop making trouble.

537
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,459
Did you act like this at your old school?

538
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,960
I don't know.

539
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,129
My goodness.

540
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,156
Yu-bin, you're so good.

541
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,866
I bet you'll get
first place at the Concours.

542
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,078
-Yu-bin, thank you so much.
-No problem.

543
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,412
She's the best among all the kids.

544
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,372
Let's go play.

545
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,373
-Okay.
-Sure.

546
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,708
Yu-bin. Put your violin in the case.

547
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,751
Okay.

548
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,004
Bravo. All I can say is bravo.

549
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,006
Goodness, when did she get so good?

550
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,550
She should major in violin.

551
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,968
Major?

552
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,220
It's just to help build her character.

553
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:39,640
She's still better
than any other kid I've heard.

554
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,267
That's what I'm saying, you know?

555
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,977
-That's so annoying.
-What is?

556
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,979
What's so annoying now?

557
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:49,149
Your two children and your husband.
You're all so perfect.

558
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,734
You have everything.

559
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,278
Your life is perfect!

560
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,446
-What's going on?
-Why?

561
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,489
Oh, no!

562
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,074
Dong-seok, are you okay?

563
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,201
-Are you okay?
-Dong-seok!

564
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:34,528
You have to apologize respectfully,
got it?

565
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,292
Who is it?

566
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,963
I'm Dong-seok's mom from across the hall.

567
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,892
Dong-seok wanted to apologize in person.

568
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,395
I'm sorry.

569
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:15,402
And if you let me know
how much the instrument costs…

570
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,698
How much are you planning on reimbursing?

571
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:24,203
I think you're getting
something very wrong here.

572
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,665
My child is entering
the Concours in two days.

573
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,377
She's used to that broken violin,
so she might not even be able to compete.

574
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,546
What would reimbursing the instrument do?

575
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,340
I see.

576
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,258
I'm sorry.

577
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,053
I'm not even sure
how I should be apologizing…

578
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,974
Right.

579
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:00,239
I sent you my account number,
so you can send the money there.

580
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,419
Three million won?

581
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,172
Start!

582
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,591
Wait for me!

583
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:23,971
CALL

584
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,347
ALMOST A STRANGER

585
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,640
We did it!

586
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:35,065
If he's not coming home,
he should at least pick up his phone.

587
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,242
LUXURIOUS MAHOGANY BOOKSHELF
100,000 WON

588
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,497
MISS NAM

589
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:54,001
Hello, could I purchase the bookshelf?

590
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,754
We're organizing our study.

591
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,923
We need someone
who can pick up it quickly.

592
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,217
I can head over immediately.

593
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,890
You'll need two people
as it's quite heavy.

594
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,267
Su-in.

595
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,019
Yes?

596
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,313
Why didn't you solve this problem?

597
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,481
The traveler…

598
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,358
One second.

599
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:22,237
Yun-ju, if you're not too busy,
could you help me out for a second?

600
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,990
Oh, no.

601
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:29,077
I'm at a dental clinic with Su-in.

602
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,543
We're here.

603
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:43,592
-There are golden ornaments.
-It's so pretty.

604
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,677
I want one.

605
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,973
Even the stairs are clean.

606
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,941
-You're here for the bookshelf, right?
-Yes.

607
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,194
The halls are so wide.

608
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,531
Hey, Dong-seok!

609
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,617
-Hi.
-Hey.

610
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,702
Is he a friend from school?

611
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,789
-Yes, hello.
-Hello.

612
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,542
I'm going to move the bookshelf.

613
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,378
Why don't you and Dong-ju
play together for a little bit?

614
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,379
Okay.

615
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:21,880
Come in.

616
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,049
-Be good.
-Okay.

617
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,348
Be careful not to scratch the floor.

618
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,976
It's very expensive.

619
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:37,354
Yes, I'll be careful. Don't worry.

620
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:42,484
Miss Nam, I think you should help her out.

621
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:46,989
Yes, ma'am.

622
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,703
Let's do it together.

623
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,125
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

624
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,839
Put your back into it.
It's not moving an inch.

625
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,048
Okay.

626
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,675
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

627
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,474
It's heavy.

628
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,435
Did you come by yourself?

629
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,271
Yes, it's fine. I can move it.

630
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:23,025
Why won't this move at all?

631
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:29,823
Eun-pyo.

632
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,081
Eun-pyo!

633
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,045
Eun-pyo.

634
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:46,423
You know how much I like you, right?

635
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,467
Eun-pyo.

636
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,843
Goodness.

637
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:53,221
How is it possible
that I'm seeing you again like this?

638
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,307
Eun-pyo.

639
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,938
Here comes the train.

640
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,611
This way.

641
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,493
Going up.

642
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,828
You can't do that.

643
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,457
How could our paths cross like this again?
Even our kids are in the same class.

644
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,293
I know, right?

645
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:32,052
Why did you leave France so suddenly?

646
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,513
And why did you drop out
of your doctorate program?

647
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,641
Do you have any idea
how much I looked for you?

648
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,978
How are you doing these days?

649
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,314
What does your husband do?

650
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,317
He's just…

651
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,361
What about work?

652
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,654
Are you working?

653
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,786
I'm asking too many questions, right?

654
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,707
I just missed you so much.

655
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:07,504
So what are you up to these days?

656
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:14,928
Mom, Dong-ju is eating grapes
with dirty hands.

657
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,597
-Okay, I'll be right there.
-Just stay here.

658
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,727
Our pretty little Dong-ju,
can I help you wash your hands?

659
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,936
Come here.

660
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,522
Don't hit it.

661
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,528
Give me this.

662
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,664
Yes, I won!

663
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,166
Run!

664
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,500
Where are you going?

665
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:33,089
How is Dong-ju such a sweetheart?

666
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,510
I need to go to the bathroom.

667
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,700
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

668
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,078
-Shoot.
-I win.

669
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:06,081
Shoot.

670
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,292
-Shoot.
-Yes!

671
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,836
-Shoot.
-I lost.

672
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:11,878
I won.

673
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,297
-Shoot.
-Shoot.

674
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,508
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

675
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,927
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

676
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:23,723
I can move it by myself.
I don't want to be a burden.

677
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,768
How could you move
such a heavy thing all by yourself?

678
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,562
Are you that strong?

679
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,942
Guys, play in the living room
for a little bit.

680
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,068
-Okay.
-Okay.

681
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,028
-Okay.
-Ice beam!

682
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,867
Here I come. Dragon!

683
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,868
Run!

684
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,663
Dragon fire!

685
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,333
Everything is still a mess
because we just moved in.

686
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,003
It takes at least
a month to get settled in.

687
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:56,715
I moved in last year
and I'm still sorting out my bookshelf.

688
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,384
What were you guys up to?

689
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,052
What?

690
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,682
Gosh, Eun-pyo.

691
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,978
You did end up getting your doctorate!

692
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,898
Yes.

693
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,193
I knew it.

694
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:21,281
There's no way you'd do nothing
but look after your kids.

695
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,783
Where do you give your lectures?

696
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,911
Are you a professor? Associate?

697
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,540
No, not yet.

698
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:35,754
-Just some schools out in the countryside.
-Then it's just a matter of time.

699
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,257
I just know you give great lectures.

700
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,218
The students really like you, right?

701
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,595
What were you doing?

702
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,376
Hello.

703
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,002
This is Yu-bin's mother.

704
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,049
About that upcoming
English-speaking competition,

705
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:24,511
what do you think about putting
Henry and Yu-bin on the same team?

706
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:29,015
It's hard to find a kid on Yu-bin's level.

707
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,560
I'm grateful for the offer,

708
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,563
but Henry isn't interested
in things like that.

709
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,483
I'm sure there are a lot of talented kids

710
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:41,277
so maybe this can be
a good opportunity for one of them.

711
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,992
Won't Henry be applying to Geoseong
University School for Gifted Students too?

712
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,326
If that's the case--

713
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,996
I'm sorry, but I'm out right now.

714
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,164
Would it be okay
if we talked some other time?

715
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,083
Of course.

716
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,393
You have no idea
how happy I was to see her.

717
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,895
I was jumping up and down on the spot.

718
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,732
Isn't that nice?

719
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:23,695
It certainly seems like it.

720
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,537
Just the thought of having her close to me

721
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,165
makes me feel
so reassured all of a sudden.

722
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:41,296
You know how much I love Eun-pyo.

723
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:48,386
Don't you think we have
such a special connection?

724
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:56,102
So what does Eun-pyo do
for work these days?

725
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,017
Darn it.

726
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:43,399
There's no way you'd do nothing
but look after your kids.

727
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:50,156
Where do you give your lectures?
Are you a professor? Associate?

728
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:02,877
Professor.

729
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:08,716
I know that no matter what I say,
it'll only come off as an excuse.

730
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:14,514
But I thought that it would only be right
for me to come and give you an apology.

731
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:23,314
I admit that I made a very bad mistake

732
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,526
but I've always been grateful to you.

733
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,406
Between raising my children

734
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:34,784
and struggling to meet deadlines,
I completely lost it for a moment…

735
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,161
Please, Professor.

736
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,872
I know what I did was terrible.

737
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,915
It was supposed to be
like a journal entry.

738
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:44,252
People write all sorts of things
in their journals about their family,

739
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:46,379
their husband, and even about their kids.

740
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,258
I messed up.

741
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,011
I really messed up, Professor.

742
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:57,974
I really want to lecture again.

743
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,267
Just once.

744
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,395
If you would give me one more chance--

745
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,064
Professor Lee, let's go have lunch.

746
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,042
How could you do this?

747
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,794
You never asked for my permission.

748
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,005
It was a secret entry.

749
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:32,592
My son accidentally
pressed a button and shared it.

750
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:39,891
If you don't take your article down,
they're going to bury me alive.

751
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,100
Sir!

752
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,945
I want to play with your phone.

753
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,948
Didn't I tell you
not to mess with my phone?

754
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,413
Don't cry.

755
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,499
Why are you crying?

756
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:07,085
I should be the one crying.
Why are you crying?

757
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,755
Do you know how hard I worked to get here?

758
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,924
It's your fault.

759
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,635
It's all your fault.

760
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,554
Mom…

761
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:40,535
SEO JIN-HA

762
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:44,539
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave a message…

763
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:50,253
EUN-PYO, WHEN SHOULD WE MEET UP AGAIN?

764
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:53,172
THERE'S A CAFE I WANT TO GO TO WITH YOU.
SHOULD WE ALSO TAKE THE KIDS?

765
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,129
Why are you up?

766
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,880
You should sleep more.

767
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,217
You know I can take Henry, right?

768
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:02,719
It's fine.

769
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,512
Thank you.

770
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:19,110
-Today at school,
-Yes.

771
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:23,197
-I'll play with the clay and…
-What if…

772
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,409
-Mom!
-Mom!

773
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:30,913
-Let's go.
-What's going on?

774
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,666
Let's go.

775
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,618
EUN-PYO

776
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,635
Eun-pyo.

777
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:13,808
SANGWE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

778
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,956
Mom? I'll head in now.

779
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,207
All right.

780
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,667
Listen to your teacher.

781
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,502
-I will.
-All right, go on.

782
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:45,923
Catch me if you can!

783
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,217
Hey, wait for me.

784
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:19,433
Mom!

785
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:22,061
-Eun-pyo!
-Eun-pyo!

786
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,814
What's wrong? Are you okay?

787
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,068
Dong-ju, come here.

788
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,277
Now that I think about it,

789
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,697
I never told you
that Louis was Henry's father.

790
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,952
You're making sure
Dong-seok is studying at home, right?

791
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,537
Dong-seok is my son.

792
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,706
If he takes after me,
he should be a sharp kid.

793
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,542
I'm not really that type of mom.

794
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:12,755
That lady saved me.

795
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,801
You should be careful around Yu-bin's mom.

796
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:20,262
But why don't you think Henry did it?

797
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:25,768
I was thrilled that my dear old friend
became a neighborhood friend.

798
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:29,480
You're doing this on purpose.
You're trying to make me feel small.

799
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:35,236
