1
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,486
Don't you feel any remorse
toward your victims?

2
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,446
Why did you create fake lewd photos?

3
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,448
Is it true that you
went by "Deepdeepdeep"?

4
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,533
Don't you feel sorry
for your victims at all?

5
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,744
-Please give us a comment.
-Please explain yourself!

6
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,873
-Please explain yourself!
-Watch out, we're coming through.

7
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,876
Are you aware that they've
canceled the production of your movie?

8
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,047
-Get in the car.
-You owe them an apology!

9
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,298
Please explain yourself!

10
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,801
The 2013 London Film Festival

11
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:36,179
Naughterland Trophy-winning director,
Oh Geon-u, was arrested and charged

12
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,474
with creating and distributing
illegal pornographic materials.

13
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,017
This has come as a major shock.

14
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:45,438
Officers from the Jeong Jin Police Station
in Seoul arrested Mr. Oh yesterday,

15
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,065
and after two rounds of interrogation…

16
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,275
Give this…

17
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,780
to Dong-seok's father.

18
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,990
I just can't find the courage

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,368
to do it myself.

20
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,705
I found it on his external hard drive.

21
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,669
I had no idea that he was this terrible.

22
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,421
If I had known…

23
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,093
I never would've said anything
about Henry's mother

24
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,554
stalking him in the first place.

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,933
If this doesn't get out,

26
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,771
he'll be released with something
like a misdemeanor.

27
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,734
I can't let him get away with this.

28
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,445
He deceived me

29
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,283
and abused my children.

30
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,750
Mr. Oh continued
to deny all of the charges,

31
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:52,297
but after receiving a USB submitted
by an anonymous source,

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,466
the police could present crucial evidence
and helped him confess everything.

33
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,843
The USB submitted to the police…

34
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,971
I heard Jul-pin's family is moving.
Did you hear about that?

35
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,848
…the video file was found,

36
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:05,101
and it came as an even bigger shock
since one of the victims

37
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,811
was a prominent figure in the arts.

38
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:11,190
The courts found
the truth behind Mr. Oh's crimes

39
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,694
and issued a warrant for his arrest
saying that he could be a flight risk.

40
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,946
Also, Mr. Oh's crimes…

41
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,951
EPISODE 15
HUMAN CHOICE

42
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,093
I didn't want you to leave like that.

43
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,137
That's why I'm here.

44
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,351
Thank you for being so courageous.

45
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,644
And also…

46
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,356
I apologize.

47
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,316
There's no need for that.

48
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,696
At first, I was resentful.

49
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,033
I wondered why you couldn't
turn a blind eye.

50
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,036
But then…

51
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,038
when I opened his hard drive,

52
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,375
I realized things could go seriously
wrong if I tried to cover it up.

53
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,087
It's all my fault.

54
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,924
I tried so hard to turn a blind eye
because I was so scared,

55
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,134
but I was only creating a monster.

56
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,393
Here.

57
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:36,401
Jul-pin always used to talk about
how Dong-seok would learn

58
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,319
all the names of the fishes.

59
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,155
So he wanted to leave this for Dong-seok.

60
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,330
Dong-seok, wasn't that so nice of Jul-pin?

61
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:55,420
I heard you taught Jul-pin
the names of the fish.

62
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,506
When did you become
such an expert on fish?

63
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,092
Can you tell Mommy all of their names too?

64
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,432
All right, take all the time you need.

65
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,854
There's also a tiny little snail here.

66
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,397
You're right.

67
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,108
I think the fish in here

68
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,485
also know that there's a snail.

69
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,695
Really?

70
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,530
Hey!

71
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,948
Stop! Out of the way!

72
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,658
-Hey, stop! Out of the way!
-Excuse me!

73
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,828
-Out of the way! Damn it!
-Damn it! Hey!

74
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,455
Shin Yu-na, stop right there!

75
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,582
-Hey! Stop!
-Damn it!

76
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,293
-Damn it!
-Hey, watch out!

77
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,339
Damn it.

78
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,715
-Damn it!
-Grab her.

79
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,759
-Are you okay, sir?
-I'm fine.

80
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,302
-Ms. Kim Yu-na, let's go.
-Go to the station.

81
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,220
-Hey, Hyeok-ho.
-Yes, sir.

82
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,765
-Let's go.
-Damn it.

83
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,103
-Her urine tests came out positive.
-What was the drug?

84
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,354
Propofol.

85
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,566
Once she tells us who her supplier is,
then we can ask for a warrant.

86
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,985
Did she not mention
who handled the needles for her?

87
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,821
She keeps saying she did it herself,
but she's left-handed

88
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,740
and all the needle marks
are on her left arm.

89
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,366
-I said I don't know!
-Gosh.

90
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,786
Once she confesses everything,
it's all over.

91
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,751
Hey.

92
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,920
Eun-pyo, did you just drop the boys off?

93
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,004
Yes.

94
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,840
They must be so excited
to see the cousins after a long time.

95
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,050
They're over the moon.

96
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,219
Mom said they should stay over
for a couple of nights

97
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,889
because spending time with Jeong-u
and Jeong-hyeon could help him talk.

98
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:33,142
Of course. It's important for them
to go out and get fresh air.

99
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,938
Aunt might have rough days,
but I guess that means you're free though.

100
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,192
Are you going to stay at home?
I wanted to drop off some side dishes.

101
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:44,445
Just make them for your family.
You don't have to make extra for us.

102
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,989
I made some super tasty
stir-fried anchovies.

103
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,283
It's too good to eat all by myself.

104
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,284
I'll be right over.

105
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,577
All right.

106
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,000
Hello?

107
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,337
How have you been?

108
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,672
Chun-hui.

109
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,842
I've been waiting for you to call me.

110
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,301
How have you been doing?

111
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,032
I got all the kids' clothes.

112
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,242
What else should I grab?

113
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:35,204
Yeong-bin's violin
and Yu-bin's dinosaur doll.

114
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,707
They've been looking for it so much.

115
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,376
It must be somewhere in the living room.

116
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,627
Well…

117
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,380
Oh, I found it.

118
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,090
All right.

119
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,436
What about your car?

120
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,481
I took a cab here. I sold my car.

121
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,690
I see.

122
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,735
Anyway, thanks so much.

123
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,112
My parents' place is so cold

124
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:12,283
and I only brought thin clothes.
I was worried they'd both catch a cold.

125
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,827
Let's pick a time and meet up soon.

126
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,538
Wait, let me give you a ride.

127
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,208
It's okay.
It's a short drive if I just take a cab.

128
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,503
My kids went to their grandma's house,
so I'm free. Just wait.

129
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,046
Wait, Eun-pyo!

130
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,615
You must've been so cold waiting.

131
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,451
Warm yourself up before we head out.

132
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:56,994
Here.

133
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,498
How about you?

134
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,250
I already had some at home.

135
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,509
Gosh, that's nice.

136
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,940
But…

137
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,945
What made you decide to get a divorce?

138
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,991
I had no idea.

139
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,704
When things get too difficult,

140
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,374
sometimes it can be hard
to talk about them.

141
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,962
To be honest,

142
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,759
I got married because of a grudge.

143
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,849
I never ended up going to jail,

144
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,934
thanks to him.

145
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,980
But I still have a criminal record.

146
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,278
The first time I went to
his parents' house after we got married,

147
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,115
I brought some coffee to their room

148
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,996
and I heard the sound
of my mother-in-law wailing.

149
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:28,586
She kept going on about
how she was so worried for her son.

150
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,549
That he got tricked into
a fraudulent marriage because of me.

151
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,724
Do you know what my husband said?

152
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,106
He said at the end of the day,
all the women are just the same

153
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,610
and that it would be easy
for him to marry me because I was dying

154
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,528
to become a doctor's wife.

155
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,414
I pretended I couldn't hear them.

156
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,084
I thought…

157
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,170
as much as it was a grudge marriage,

158
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,757
if I got what I wanted
and I gave what he needed, it'd be okay.

159
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,759
But now that I look back on it,

160
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,306
I never should've lived my life like that.

161
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,444
That tastes so good.

162
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,196
So tasty.

163
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,161
I'm heading over now.

164
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,711
PARK YUN-JU

165
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,131
Why is there so much traffic today?

166
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,431
I won't be able to go
to that bakery anymore.

167
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,684
My kids always loved
the bread at that store.

168
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,243
What are you doing?

169
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,745
Wait here.
I'll go buy some since we're here anyway.

170
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,581
No, it's fine Eun-pyo.

171
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,623
Eun-pyo!

172
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,514
Eun-pyo.

173
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,979
Enjoy the bread, Dong-seok's mom.

174
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,731
-Thank you.
-Bye.

175
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,986
Yun-ju, hold on.

176
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,154
Let go of me!

177
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,531
Since when were you
so close with that woman?

178
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,991
Su-in's mom.

179
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,037
-We should talk.
-I have nothing to say to you.

180
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,875
I want to clear the air before I leave.

181
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,923
Su-in's mom, don't take this
the wrong way.

182
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,717
Eun-pyo…

183
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:33,437
Dong-seok's mom wasn't
trying to deceive you on purpose.

184
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,064
Let's hear you say it.

185
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,524
What's going on?

186
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,652
-The thing is--
-Do you have no pride?

187
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,737
It's not like that…

188
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,907
Eun-pyo, did you forget
what this woman did to you?

189
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,036
-Think about what happened to Dong-seok--
-We met at the hospital.

190
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,122
Yu-bin…

191
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,042
kept coming up with lies.

192
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,087
So we went to the hospital

193
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,507
and they said
it was some kind of a sickness.

194
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,594
I knew that if I told everyone about it,

195
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,265
they'd say that I got what I deserved
after screwing up big time.

196
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,102
There was no one
I could talk to about this…

197
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,150
at all.

198
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,947
Things were getting dark
and everything looked bleak,

199
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,491
but we happened to run into
each other at the hospital.

200
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,369
You know,

201
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,206
people in the same boat
can support and help each other.

202
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,424
What about now?

203
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,471
She's still in therapy and working on it.

204
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,854
I'm sure it'll take some time.

205
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,441
I put way too much…

206
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,777
pressure on her.

207
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,415
You can't just do that.

208
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,090
Who said you could just start
talking about that?

209
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,977
-You're not going to drink?
-What?

210
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,521
I thought you said you were free today.

211
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,899
Right.

212
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,656
Bottoms up.

213
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,636
ANESTHESIOLOGY

214
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,806
The door has been successfully opened.

215
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,617
What do you want?

216
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,245
What's taking you so long, Doctor?

217
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,122
I'm at the hospital right now.
Just hang on.

218
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,586
I'm in the parking lot, so get down here
as soon as possible, Doctor.

219
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,921
Okay.

220
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,334
Seriously.

221
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,336
Hey, you!

222
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,882
How did you manage
to keep that from me so well?

223
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,135
Your cousin has some serious
acting chops, you know that?

224
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,764
I just felt so bad about how much
I insisted that you were the one

225
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,348
who'd written the letter.

226
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,477
-Hey, Lee Eun-pyo!
-So I tried to stop you. Right, Yun-ju?

227
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,939
Chun-hui, the three of us
were all up to something.

228
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,400
That's what happened.

229
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,570
-Gosh, how sneaky.
-Yes. Let's just call it even.

230
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,073
-Jeez.
-Jeez, whatever.

231
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,869
Damn it, why are you making
me come to a place like this?

232
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,371
There are no security cameras there.

233
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,878
All right. Just hurry up, will you?

234
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:11,215
No, that's not the reason why I did that.

235
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,468
I'm going to excuse myself
to the bathroom first.

236
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,846
-Goodness.
-Me too.

237
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,475
Are you guys high school
bathroom buddies or something?

238
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,188
It's really cold out.

239
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,564
Are you okay?

240
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,941
Yes, I'm fine.

241
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,485
Gosh, why is the bathroom outside?

242
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,445
Seriously.

243
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,115
-You go first.
-No, you go first.

244
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,282
-No, that's okay.
-No.

245
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,450
Chun-hui?

246
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:41,995
Damn.

247
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,956
Long time no see, Chun-hui.

248
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,042
You rat! Do you know how hard
you've been making things for me?

249
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,551
Wait, there was no
toilet paper in the bathroom.

250
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,179
Eun-pyo!

251
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,015
Damn it.

252
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,520
Damn it!

253
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,064
Seriously.

254
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,444
Hey, where have you been hiding?

255
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,281
-Where have you been hiding my kids?
-Damn it.

256
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,121
-You're coming with me.
-Let go!

257
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,873
-I said come with me!
-Chun-hui!

258
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,882
Is there anything I can do?

259
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,884
I'll call you later.

260
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,177
Come with me.

261
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,220
-Let go!
-Come on!

262
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,855
Man-su, get up.

263
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,772
What is it?

264
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,399
I said get up right now!

265
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,030
What's going on?

266
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,741
Lee Man-su.

267
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,577
Tell me the truth.

268
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,329
You can't lie about this.

269
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,455
About what?

270
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,874
Have you been meeting up
with Chun-hui or not?

271
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,462
You punk!

272
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,631
Did I not say we're getting
a divorce if you meet her again?

273
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,092
No, that's not it.
We didn't meet up that way.

274
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:24,181
It's just that her husband
kept asking me to get drugs for him.

275
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,184
I just wanted to tell her to stop him.

276
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,769
So I called her that one time.

277
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,272
So what did you say to him?

278
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,274
I obviously told him I couldn't.

279
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,576
Man-su, listen to me carefully.

280
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,289
Even if you don't love me,
you still love our Su-in, right?

281
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,332
What are you talking about?

282
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,000
If we crumble and fall,

283
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,753
Su-in is going to crumble and fall, okay?

284
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,716
Don't get involved
with her or her husband.

285
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,887
Man-su, no matter what the situation is,

286
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,016
don't ever forget that
you are Su-in's father, okay?

287
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,519
Okay.

288
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,230
-Let go!
-Get over here!

289
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,278
Get in.

290
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,533
You stay right there.

291
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,831
Where are the kids?

292
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,458
Tell me where my kids are!

293
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,295
Why are you still selling drugs
if you care about your kids?

294
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,090
Do you have any idea
how scary those people are?

295
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,092
What do you expect me to do?

296
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,012
My mom cut ties with me
and even Ju-eun won't pick up my calls!

297
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,681
Those punks went to
my mom's house and threatened her!

298
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,599
What more do you expect me to do?

299
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,439
If I don't get them their money,

300
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,566
you and the kids
will be their next target.

301
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,568
Do you still think I don't care about you?

302
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,785
-What are you doing?
-I'm telling him to come back.

303
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,580
Seriously?

304
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,623
-Are you crazy?
-Give it back!

305
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,376
-Honey, come to your senses!
-Give it back!

306
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,545
Come to your senses!

307
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,590
We'll be done for good
if we get more involved.

308
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,427
The guy living in front of
our house is a policeman.

309
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,973
When Henry's mom killed herself,
he was the one investigating her case.

310
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:34,811
Do you want to have a criminal record too?
As if it's not enough that I have one?

311
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,483
Hey.

312
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,235
Why would you only now tell me that?

313
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,280
Why the hell would you
only now tell me that?

314
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,787
Damn it, why didn't you tell me sooner?

315
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,630
Seriously!

316
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,211
What?

317
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,671
Did you not sleep?

318
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,132
Or did you just get up?

319
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,175
Yes, I just got up.

320
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,689
Is something bothering you?

321
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,233
No.

322
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,196
Then why couldn't you sleep well?

323
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,867
No, I slept well.

324
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,083
Right, Eun-pyo.

325
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,879
I might be getting a promotion soon.

326
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,340
We're in the middle
of investigating a drug ring,

327
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,426
and it turns out
it's more large-scale than we thought.

328
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,304
If we catch all of them,
it'll be some newsworthy stuff.

329
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,349
What do you think? Will I look good on TV?

330
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,227
-Like Mr. Handsome Detective.
-Yes.

331
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,479
"Yes."

332
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,440
What kind of reaction is that?

333
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:47,319
You should say "my husband is the best"
or "my husband's the coolest."

334
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,529
I wouldn't mind
getting a nice pat on the head…

335
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,906
Pat, pat, you know?

336
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,117
Go wash up.

337
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,205
Pat, pat…

338
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,291
Okay.

339
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,469
I heard Professor Lee is going to release
a book about his 30 years as a critic?

340
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:18,350
No one wants to
get stuck working on that book.

341
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,937
He's going to make someone else do
everything without giving them any credit.

342
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,274
I wonder which poor sap
is going to get sucked in this time.

343
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,657
Eun-pyo, do you know what this is?

344
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,660
This is a sedative anesthetic.

345
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:40,038
It's the addictive anesthetic
that's always on the news.

346
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,295
I think she might be
secretly selling drugs on the side.

347
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,049
Don't be ridiculous.

348
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,301
I heard Yu-bin's father

349
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,804
is on the verge of
having to shut down his hospital.

350
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,683
You said she even moved out.
They're in a tight situation right now.

351
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,309
Then what would be
the easiest thing for him to do?

352
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,562
I said I saw her at that motel, right?

353
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,773
Something was seriously off.

354
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,193
And even when Jin-ha passed away,

355
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,279
the whole situation was quite strange.

356
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,949
Eun-pyo.

357
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,868
Do you think they're related?

358
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:40,181
Chun-hui, your stuff from yesterday
is still sitting in my trunk.

359
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,142
I'll drop it off.

360
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,297
Chun-hui.

361
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,019
You could've just mailed it.

362
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,438
You didn't need to come all the way here.

363
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,694
I knew how much your kids needed
their stuff, so it couldn't wait.

364
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,989
Thanks.

365
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,700
You're going through a lot because of me.

366
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,869
Don't worry about it.

367
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,145
I'll be heading out then.

368
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,108
Let me know
if there's anything I can do to help.

369
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:21,074
Why aren't you asking me anything?

370
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,537
Aren't you curious?

371
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,459
Now that I'm older,

372
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,004
I know I shouldn't ask questions
when people don't want to talk about it.

373
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,340
I know that much.

374
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,580
PROFESSOR LEE YEONG-GUN

375
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,628
Hello, Professor.

376
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,756
Hello, have you been well Eun-pyo?

377
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,049
Yes. Have you been well?

378
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,259
Sure.

379
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,470
To what do I owe your phone call?

380
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,639
I just happened to think of you.

381
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,934
How have you been doing these days?

382
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:35,064
I've been living quietly.

383
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,736
From what I hear, you've started to do
some lectures at Sungmyung University.

384
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,029
Is it true?

385
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,614
Yes.

386
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,656
Oh, jeez.

387
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,994
You must've been very desperate to have
gotten yourself a job like that

388
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,038
at a school
with absolutely no connections.

389
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:54,167
As your advisor, you have no idea
how sorry that makes me feel.

390
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,464
If you have time tomorrow,
you should come over for a cup of tea.

391
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,675
Can you make it?

392
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,928
Yes.

393
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,638
All right, then.

394
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,973
Come to my teaching laboratory
around lunchtime.

395
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,392
Okay.

396
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,353
See you tomorrow.

397
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,906
Are you ready to make your order?

398
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,382
What do you like the best here?

399
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,969
-The pizza.
-The pizza?

400
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,804
Eat as much as you want.

401
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,723
-Do you want some more pizza?
-Yes.

402
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,226
-Let's all have some more.
-Enjoy your food.

403
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,104
-You should have some too.
-Thank you.

404
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,692
You should eat, too.

405
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,910
The first time I saw her, I was in shock.

406
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,924
I thought I had finally found you

407
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,886
after ten years of searching.

408
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,650
But the more I lived with her,
I realized she could never

409
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,153
become you.

410
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,950
Do you think there was even a single day
that I was happy living with you?

411
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,287
So what? You're going to
leave me and run away?

412
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,123
You bastard.

413
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,878
You think I don't know that you're
trying to run away from me with Henry?

414
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,796
-You think I don't know that?
-I ended up

415
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,135
paying dearly for having chosen
that woman over you.

416
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,192
But why…

417
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,820
didn't you tell me that your wife died?

418
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,287
I was afraid that you'd leave me again.

419
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,625
I was afraid that you'd run away again.

420
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,077
Did she…

421
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,664
know about me?

422
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,042
Did she…

423
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,212
die because of me?

424
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,330
Henry.

425
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,626
Today, we're going to
meet one of Daddy's friends.

426
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,546
You see…

427
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,673
This friend of mine

428
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,260
looks a lot like mom.

429
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,642
-I thought it was strange too…
-How did you

430
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,270
meet your friend?

431
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,397
What?

432
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,776
Well…

433
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,699
By chance?

434
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,995
Anyway,

435
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,997
I just didn't want you to be alarmed.

436
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,457
Okay?

437
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,137
Rhéa.

438
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,235
Henry?

439
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,113
You should say hi to Daddy's friend.

440
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:20,118
No, I don't want to!

441
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,663
No, just leave him be.
I think he's really scared.

442
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,748
I'm going to go to grandma's house!

443
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,334
Take me back to grandma's house!

444
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,757
Take me back to grandma's house!

445
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:39,679
I want to go back to grandma's house!

446
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,056
I want to go!

447
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,005
Louis.

448
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,883
Louis!

449
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,526
-You're back.
-Hey.

450
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,570
I'm absolutely exhausted.

451
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,699
We did it!

452
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,618
We arrested 20 of them!

453
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,870
-Really?
-Yes.

454
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,955
That's really impressive.

455
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,124
So does that mean the case is over?

456
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,044
We just need to catch
a couple of the little guys.

457
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,797
You have no idea what kind of fight they
were putting up. I almost died out there.

458
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,426
But you know, they couldn't have
gotten the job done without me.

459
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,221
Of course. You did well.

460
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,848
Was everything okay while I was gone?

461
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,683
Everything was fine.

462
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,686
Oh, Professor Lee called me.

463
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,979
Really?

464
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,064
Yes.

465
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,483
He said he was thinking of me
and wanted to meet up.

466
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,984
That's good news.

467
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,153
I know it's always been on your mind.

468
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,571
I know, right?

469
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,573
I'm meeting him today.

470
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,783
That's good.

471
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,993
I hope you can get
everything cleared up today.

472
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,912
Yes. Go wash up so we can eat.

473
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,955
Okay.

474
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,743
Jae-ung, Jang Won-tae snitched

475
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,413
and he says the needle lady's
name is Byeon Chun-hui.

476
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,665
Wasn’t she your next-door neighbor?

477
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,297
Eun-pyo!

478
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,173
Yes?

479
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,509
We're out of shampoo.
Can you grab me another one?

480
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,427
Right, shampoo.

481
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,308
Here you go.

482
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,809
Sure.

483
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,372
DONG-SIK: THE NEEDLE LADY'S NAME
IS BYEON CHUN-HUI

484
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,657
Hey, Eun-pyo.

485
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,576
What's going on?

486
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,455
Chun-hui, I think
the police have noticed it.

487
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:36,916
What?

488
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,502
-Eun-pyo!
-What?

489
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,630
Do you know where my dark jeans are?
The ones I always wear.

490
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,633
Why do you always ask?
They're in the bin underneath the hangers.

491
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,675
Find it for me.

492
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,636
Gosh, seriously.

493
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,306
How can you not find it
when it's right there?

494
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,933
It's always somewhere different.

495
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,235
DONG-SIK

496
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,826
DELETE

497
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,834
YUN-JU

498
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,464
-Did I get a call?
-Yes.

499
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,258
Jae-ung.

500
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,093
Hey, Yun-ju, what's going on?

501
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,138
There's something I needed to tell you.

502
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,932
You know…

503
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,476
the couple that lives across from you?

504
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,063
Something just feels off about them.

505
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,440
Okay.

506
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,359
What do you mean?

507
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,489
So?

508
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,493
Tell me exactly what you saw.

509
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,579
Okay.

510
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,457
What?

511
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,834
I'm actually on my way out.

512
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,627
Can you come to the station later?

513
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,473
Hey, Eun-pyo.

514
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,558
Chun-hui.

515
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:23,689
I think they're going to
issue a warrant for your arrest.

516
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,903
What do you think about…

517
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,530
just turning yourself in?

518
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,201
Maybe you could ask for them
to extenuate your offense--

519
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,118
No.

520
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,415
You know…

521
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,418
I have priors.

522
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,630
If I get charged with anything again,

523
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,051
they won't give me a chance at probation.

524
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,135
Wait.

525
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,720
Wait.

526
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,849
My mom's busy taking care of my father,

527
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,976
so she won't be able
to take care of the kids.

528
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,314
I don't even know what's going to happen

529
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,816
because of all of my husband's
gambling debts either.

530
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,944
Eun-pyo, what do I do?

531
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,489
My kids aren't going to have
any place to go. What do I do?

532
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,375
Eun-pyo.

533
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,337
My sister

534
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,924
lives in Canada.

535
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:37,096
Do you think it would be okay
if I go there and come back real quick?

536
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,516
I'll just leave
my kids there and come back.

537
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:45,437
I'll come right back and do my time.

538
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,817
Can you please help me
until then, Eun-pyo?

539
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,361
I'll come back and do my time.

540
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:55,823
I'll leave my kids there and come back.
Please help me until then, Eun-pyo.

541
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,786
PLEASE CONTACT YOUR CREDIT CARD COMPANY

542
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:22,975
MR. LEE

543
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,718
Hey, Chun-hui.

544
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,386
Man-su.

545
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,555
Can you talk right now?

546
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,640
Yes.

547
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,644
I called because I have a favor to ask.

548
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,397
Man-su, I need you to lend me some money.

549
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,024
What?

550
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,028
The police found out about everything.

551
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,533
I'm planning to go to my sister in Canada

552
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,413
to leave my kids with her,
but I have no money.

553
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:33,045
Man-su, I'm sorry.
I just need this one last thing.

554
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:37,383
Please help me out one last time, Man-su.

555
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,657
Don't get involved
with her or her husband.

556
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,619
Man-su, no matter what the situation is,

557
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,415
don't ever forget that
you are Su-in's father, okay?

558
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:37,067
I really wasn't going to say anything.

559
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,613
But the longer I thought about it,
the stranger it felt.

560
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,824
There was this one time

561
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,077
when I followed her to a motel,

562
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,246
and she was there with a girl and a guy.

563
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,205
I mean…

564
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:53,292
Even if I think about it now
it's pretty weird.

565
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,881
By any chance…

566
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,260
are these the same people?

567
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,389
Goodness, Jae-ung.

568
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,100
You're right. It's the same people.

569
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:42,633
Excuse me.

570
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,219
I need some cash really urgently.

571
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,685
Mom, where are we going?

572
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,146
To your aunt's place.

573
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,690
Which aunt?

574
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,692
Canada?

575
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,569
This is so exciting!

576
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,279
Does that mean we get to go skiing?

577
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:09,576
Yeong-bin, we're going to go to Canada
to go skiing and all that!

578
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:11,787
1 UNREAD MESSAGE

579
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:12,871
Let's hurry up.

580
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,206
I'm in front of your place…

581
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,125
Kids.

582
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,086
Get dressed and wait for me.

583
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,646
There wasn't anything suspicious
on your way here, right?

584
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:38,855
No.

585
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,858
I'm sorry.

586
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,111
You must've been really shocked.

587
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,824
I was worried that they'd arrest me
as soon as they found me.

588
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,953
I'll pay you back as soon as I get there,
so don't worry about that.

589
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,333
What is it?

590
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,837
What is it, Man-su?

591
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,800
I'm sorry, Chun-hui.

592
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,220
I had to…

593
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,515
go to a loan shark

594
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,101
because I knew I wouldn't be able to
get a loan with my credit history.

595
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,979
But I couldn't do it.

596
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,984
I couldn't go behind
my wife and child's back.

597
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,946
If it was only between me and you…

598
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,365
I really wanted

599
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,869
to do anything I could
to help you out with the money.

600
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,913
But when I thought

601
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,292
about how much
I searched around to find jobs

602
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,295
and how I lost my store,

603
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:47,049
and how all of that made my family suffer,
I couldn't just do that to them again.

604
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,217
I'm too terrified of that happening again.

605
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,679
I'm so sorry, Chun-hui.

606
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,391
I'm so sorry.

607
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,192
I'm so sorry, Chun-hui.

608
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,819
I really wanted to help you.

609
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,997
Man-su, I'm sorry.

610
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,416
I'm sorry, Man-su.

611
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,007
It's okay.

612
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:32,010
It's okay, I'm sorry.

613
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,364
A TEACHING LABORATORY
LEE YEONG-GUN

614
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,706
He says to come in.

615
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,790
Okay.

616
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,424
A CRITICAL RESPONSE TO CONTEMPORARY ART

617
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:20,892
I don't know if you heard
from any of your cohorts,

618
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:26,148
but it turns out this year is the
30th anniversary of my work as a critic.

619
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,649
I wanted to let things slip by,

620
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,444
but everyone around me
was adamant that I shouldn't do that.

621
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,988
Of course.

622
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,950
If you consider the influence you've had
in the art scene over the years,

623
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:41,413
it's only right that you pursue
some sort of commemorative publication.

624
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,957
I'm grateful that you feel that way.

625
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,210
Well…

626
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,880
On that note,

627
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:54,509
I need someone to get
all of my publishing materials organized.

628
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,763
And it's not the type of work
I'd want to entrust to just anyone.

629
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,849
Is there anyone that you know of?

630
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,353
If there's anything

631
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,440
I might be able to help out with…

632
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:09,357
Gosh.

633
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,194
I'd be thankful if could you help me.

634
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:19,659
But if there's any more rumors
about the exploitation of labor

635
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,370
or any kind of unjust claims…

636
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,498
Don't worry about that.

637
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,211
I'd appreciate it
if you could forget about that.

638
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:37,469
INCOMING CALL

639
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,264
Is it an urgent call?

640
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,516
Not at all, Professor.

641
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:48,313
I actually never intended
to see you again.

642
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:52,150
But as the older, wiser person,

643
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,737
I figured I should be the one
to forgive and forget.

644
00:51:57,072 --> 00:52:00,033
Hate it or love it,
you're still my student.

645
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,830
Anyway, it took a lot for me
to give you that phone call,

646
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,123
so I hope you won't
make any more mistakes.

647
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:11,086
First, I have a meeting with
the Arts Department professors tomorrow.

648
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,213
You should come by to apologize.

649
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:20,595
I'm sorry, but would it be okay
for me to take this phone call, sir?

650
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,532
Chun-hui.

651
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,076
What am I going to do

652
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,453
about my poor kids?

653
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:51,126
What am I going to do?

654
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,796
I feel like it's all over.

655
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,592
What do I do, Eun-pyo?

656
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:03,805
Chun-hui.

657
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,685
This is five million won.

658
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:10,854
I'm sorry.

659
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,482
This is all the money
I can lend you right now.

660
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,860
With our house and my student loans,

661
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,029
we have a mountain of debt too.

662
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,285
How can I take this?

663
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,913
It's not time for you
to pick and choose right now.

664
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,956
You said you'd only think of your kids.

665
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,380
If things were any different,

666
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,843
I'd tell you to turn yourself in.

667
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:45,263
But when I put myself in your shoes,

668
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,684
I think I'd also think
of taking care of my boys first.

669
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,103
The most important thing right now

670
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:55,273
is to make sure
that they have a safe place to stay.

671
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,781
Thank you.

672
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,876
It's okay, Chun-hui.

673
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,545
Everything is going to be okay.

674
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,007
-I'm sorry.
-Everything's going to work out.

675
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,846
Ruby, we're going to Canada right now.

676
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,515
Isn't that so exciting?

677
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,894
We can go skiing when we get there.
I'll let you ride with me.

678
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,313
Let's go and make a snowman together too.

679
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,608
Kids, hurry up and get in the car.

680
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,750
BYEON JONG-SU

681
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,044
She's wanted
for illegal medical activities.

682
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:01,131
Have you been
in contact with her recently?

683
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,651
Excuse me.

684
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:32,120
You're going through
all this suffering all because of me.

685
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,332
Gosh, my baby.
How can you just leave like this?

686
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,211
Mom, I'm sorry.

687
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,588
My goodness.

688
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,175
-Mom, I'm sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

689
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:49,637
It's all my fault.

690
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:53,641
Mom, I'm sorry.

691
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:57,687
Gosh, my poor baby. What do I do?

692
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:43,525
ALMOST A STRANGER

693
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:49,697
REJECT

694
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,956
I'm asking you to do things
you shouldn't have to do.

695
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,976
Were you aware that

696
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,813
Byeon Chun-hui engaged
in illegal medical activities?

697
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,357
No.

698
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,987
When did she move out?

699
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,323
Is there anywhere you think
she might have moved to?

700
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,950
She probably went to her parents' place.

701
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,415
I don't know where she moved to.

702
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,465
Is there anyone
whom she might've asked for help from?

703
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,349
Yeong-bin, Yu-bin, have a safe trip, okay?

704
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:02,437
Listen to your mom and stay healthy, okay?

705
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,118
What time is your flight?

706
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,745
It's at 2:30 a.m.

707
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,415
I wanted to see you off,
but I guess it's a bit too late.

708
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,417
You should get going.

709
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,295
You've had such a rough day because of me.

710
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,006
No, not at all.

711
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,061
Have a safe trip.

712
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,445
I'll get going.

713
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,197
All right.

714
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,578
Gosh, you scared me.

715
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,289
What are you doing?

716
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,790
Where are you coming back from?

717
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,335
I told you this morning
I was going to meet with the professor.

718
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,046
Eun-pyo.

719
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,549
There's something I need to ask you.

720
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:56,968
You're close…

721
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,721
with the lady next door, right?

722
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:04,892
The kids are friends with each other.

723
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:08,521
Was there anything suspicious
you noticed about her?

724
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:11,983
No.

725
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:12,900
Why?

726
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:16,321
I'm just asking.

727
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:20,867
In case something happens
in the neighborhood,

728
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,035
don't get too alarmed, okay?

729
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,579
What do you mean?

730
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,000
Gosh, my wife.

731
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,711
You're like a child left on the beach

732
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,213
who has no idea
what the real world is like.

733
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,268
Hey.

734
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,230
Are you getting some rest?

735
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:33,189
How are the kids?

736
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:37,110
The kids must've been exhausted.

737
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,529
Both of them are fast asleep.

738
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,283
I'm never going to forget
what you've done for me.

739
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,745
You've done so much.

740
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,999
You're the one
I'll never forget, Chun-hui.

741
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,754
I was able to get through
the hard times because of you.

742
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,799
I'm just…

743
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:05,513
I'm just going to leave the kids
with my sister and come right back.

744
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,308
I'll come back and do my time.

745
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,688
I figured that my kids

746
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,358
might get traumatized
if they see their mom like this.

747
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,277
I know exactly how you feel.

748
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,531
I hope you have a safe flight.

749
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,536
We'll be…

750
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,539
able to see each other again, right?

751
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,376
Of course.

752
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,473
EUN-PYO

753
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,099
YOUR BATTERY IS LOW

754
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,327
Could I charge my phone, please?

755
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:10,328
Sure.

756
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:16,375
Thank you.

757
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:26,469
Eun-pyo.

758
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:30,932
Why did you do it?

759
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,683
Jae-ung.

760
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,352
You're a detective's wife.

761
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:37,522
How could you…

762
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,274
do this to me?

763
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:43,945
I'm sorry.

764
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,989
I'm so sorry, but…

765
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,034
I felt so bad for her.

766
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:51,619
I'm a mother too,

767
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,247
and I know too well what she's feeling.

768
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,875
I didn't want her to get arrested
in front of her children.

769
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,002
Even so, how could you help
a criminal escape?

770
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:01,921
Don't you know that's a crime?

771
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,339
It's not like that.

772
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:06,801
She didn't run away. She's going to come
back after leaving her kids there.

773
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,469
She promised she'd turn herself in.

774
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,721
I swear that's exactly
what she said she'd do.

775
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:15,601
Can't you just wait until then?

776
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:20,398
-Stop talking like a fool.
-Jae-ung.

777
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,485
Hey, Dong-sik.

778
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:27,405
I need you to track a number for me.

779
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:31,033
The number is 010-0651-2995.

780
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,954
I think she's at the airport right now,
so put her on a no-fly list.

781
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,914
Jae-ung.

782
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,378
What do I do?

783
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,302
Come to Incheon International Airport.

784
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,720
I want men lined up in the boarding area.

785
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:00,479

The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a message after the tone.

788
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,498
Chun-hui, this is Eun-pyo.

789
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:02,625
They put you…

790
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,461
on a no-fly list.

791
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:08,381
You're going to get caught
right away if you board the plane.

792
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:12,385
When you get this message, you need to
come to the parking lot, okay?

793
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:15,304
Don't board the plane, okay?

794
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:37,493
Kids, wake up.

795
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,495
We're late. Hurry up and wake up.

796
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:40,871
I'm sleepy.

797
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,248
-Hurry.
-Mom, just a little bit more…

798
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,416
No.

799
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,042
Put your jackets on.

800
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,420
Put your shoes on.

801
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:50,965
Let's go.

802
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,303
Kids, go to the left.

803
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,202
Where is she?

804
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,371
-She's not here. Damn it.
-Damn it.

01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,094
We missed her. Let's go.

808
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,345
-Hyeok-ho, go that way!
-Yes, sir.

809
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,056
-Dong-sik, go this way!
-Yes, sir.

810
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:45,811
Yeong-bin, come on. Stick next to Mommy.

811
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,352
Chun-hui!

812
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,999
Mom, how come we're not going to Canada
and going somewhere else?

813
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,793
Where are we going?

814
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,419
Yu-bin, I'll explain later.

815
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,587
So just run!

816
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,884
-Mom!
-What?

817
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,761
I left Ruby.

818
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,221
I have to go back!

819
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:05,057
What are you talking about?
I'll buy you another one.

820
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,643
-Let's go.
-No!

821
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:09,937
We have to go find Ruby!

822
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,063
Damn it.

823
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:13,983
-They're not there?
-No.

824
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,359
-Damn it.
-They're not there?

825
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:17,236
Yu-bin, I'll get you a new one.

826
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,779
-Hey, over there!
-Yes, sir.

827
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,406
-No!
-Damn it.

828
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:23,367
I'm not going anywhere without Ruby!

829
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:24,952
We have to go back to find Ruby!

830
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,245
Yu-bin, please.

831
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:41,468
Mom!

832
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:17,022
