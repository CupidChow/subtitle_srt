1
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,160
You think I don't know your true colors?

2
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,912
Acting like you care.

3
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,331
Acting like you feel sorry.

4
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:25,210
But in reality,
you dig up on others' sore spots--

5
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,467
I'm sorry, Eun-pyo.

6
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,803
I was just--

7
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,229
We're even now, right?

8
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,886
Eun-pyo.

9
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,348
Even though we won't
be going to the same school,

10
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,559
that won't change what we have, will it?

11
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,893
Of course not.

12
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,897
Either way,
congratulations on getting accepted.

13
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,942
Thanks.

14
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,499
Stop crying.

15
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,378
You can still go to the College of Arts
even if you didn't get into art school.

16
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,214
No, it's not that.

17
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,009
I also want a CD player, Mom.

18
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,137
How come I'm the only one
without a CD player?

19
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,154
SEO JIN-HA

20
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,472
Eun-pyo!

21
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,977
Eun-pyo.

22
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,563
You know how much I like you, right?

23
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,233
Eun-pyo.

24
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,193
Eun-pyo!

25
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,781
I really like you.

26
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,785
This is so nice.

27
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,801
EPISODE 3
THAT DAWN BEFORE THE DAY BREAKS

28
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,530
What are you doing here?

29
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,973
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

30
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,644
Please help me, Yu-bin's mother.

31
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,567
Now that I think about it,
I think I was being arrogant.

32
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,155
To be honest, I've been neglecting
my children's education

33
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,948
in pursuit of my own studies.

34
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,493
And at the end of the day…

35
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,705
the kids suffered the consequences.

36
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,252
But I don't know what to do about it.

37
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,340
I have no idea where to even start.

38
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,265
Well, a favor like that…

39
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,977
kind of puts me on the spot.

40
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,940
I'm sorry.

41
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,068
But it's up to you to find
what's right for your kids.

42
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,196
Seeking advice won't solve it.

43
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,575
If I hastily give you advice,

44
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,702
that might do more harm to the kids.

45
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,457
Oh, I see.

46
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,043
You're right.

47
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,636
This must be it.

48
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,223
PRIVATE MATH LESSONS
READING COMPREHENSION TRAINING

49
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,991
What is all this? It's so hard.

50
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,201
Is it difficult?

51
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,119
Yes.

52
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,955
-Please come in.
-Okay.

53
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,373
Wait here for a minute.

54
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,960
DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION

55
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,482
But…

56
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,986
Won't he learn to solve
these problems in fourth grade?

57
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,573
I'm sorry, but in this neighborhood,

58
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,868
it's common practice
to study at least two years ahead.

59
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,705
It makes it impossible to divide up
the classes if we don't do this.

60
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,666
So…

61
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,710
You're saying that

62
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:27,340
you're only accepting kids
who study ahead.

63
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,927
But then, what about the kids
who don't study ahead?

64
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,766
There are hardly any parents
who don't work ahead in this neighborhood.

65
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,144
So this kind of material
is easy for first graders.

66
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,734
As you can see, we don't offer any classes
that stick to the pace set by schools.

67
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,071
I'm sorry, but I think you should
look into another academy.

68
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,954
We only offer courses
with an advanced curriculum

69
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,623
and don't offer any
that follow the school curriculum.

70
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,624
I'm sorry.

71
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,584
All right.

72
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,630
Dong-seok, let's go.

73
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,717
Oh, hello.

74
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,512
An advanced middle school
curriculum is available.

75
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,013
Yes, of course.

76
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,770
Get in here.

77
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,815
Get in!

78
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,279
Hey! Why can't you stay focused?

79
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,949
Min-u got in, but why did you fail?

80
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,288
Do you think you deserve to cry? Stop!

81
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,624
Look this way.

82
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,334
Okay.

83
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,837
Look to the front.

84
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,131
All right, that looks good.

85
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,419
I hope I didn't call you
when you couldn't spare the time.

86
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,795
Oh, not at all.

87
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,173
It's an honor that you reached out to me.

88
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,510
Was there a special reason
why you decided to write a book?

89
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:41,349
Well, if I were to say
I wanted to share the truth with my child,

90
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,768
would that be too abstract?

91
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,436
No, not at all.

92
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,189
Then you'll be needing a ghostwriter, yes?

93
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,398
Yes.

94
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,485
If they can speak French,

95
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,196
that'll be even better.

96
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,750
Was today tiring for you, Dong-seok?

97
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,346
What does this look like to you?

98
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,015
Vegetables.

99
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,059
Really?

100
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,018
An onion.

101
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,728
Radishes.

102
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,691
Mushrooms and garlic?

103
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,445
What about now?

104
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,241
There's an even more interesting one.

105
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,662
That's so cool.

106
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,372
That's awesome.

107
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,417
Is my boy feeling a bit better now?

108
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,129
Sorry for making it so hard on you today.

109
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,258
What do you want for dinner tonight?
How about some bulgogi?

110
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,926
I also want sausages!

111
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,470
All right. Let's go.

112
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,273
No, you can only get one.

113
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,279
Really? Dong-seok?

114
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,281
That's what I'm saying.

115
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,909
I heard he's on the blacklist
in the class.

116
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,372
I heard people are quietly asking
for their kids not to be in his class.

117
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,832
Gosh, what's that all about?

118
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,794
Well, he did seem very distracted
when I saw him on the open class day.

119
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:38,299
But why would that woman
not make her kid study all this time?

120
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,301
Especially when she's a professor.

121
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,597
People like that
usually have no sense of reality.

122
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,433
Typical professors
and their armchair theories.

123
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,811
Jeez, then why did she even move
to this neighborhood?

124
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,605
I agree.

125
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,398
People just blindly move in

126
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,068
without thinking if their kids are capable
when they hear there's a good school.

127
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,446
Yun-ju,

128
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,575
it may put you in an awkward spot
since you're her cousin,

129
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,702
But try to keep your kid away from hers.

130
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,288
Remember that awful dance
he put on last time?

131
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,832
It seems like he watches too much TV.

132
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,085
He has no class.

133
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,462
Goodness.

134
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,131
Are you going to eat it all?

135
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,679
-I didn't buy everything yet.
-That one's too salty.

136
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,264
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

137
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,810
Let's go.

138
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,657
Dong-seok.

139
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,118
Do you want to go over there
and look at the toys for a second?

140
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,620
-Okay.
-All right.

141
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,298
They don't do it all the time.
You should buy them now--

142
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,926
Eun-pyo, did you come to get groceries?

143
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,719
Who's on the blacklist?

144
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,388
What?

145
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,181
So who's ranked as an A-plus?

146
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,559
And who's ranked even higher than that?

147
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,731
I guess you divide even your children
into ranks in this neighborhood.

148
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,818
I have no idea what you're talking about.

149
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,821
They're kids and they're still growing.

150
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,240
How could you rank them?

151
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,409
I think there's been a misunderstanding--

152
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:32,371
You people are all trying to
raise your own kids.

153
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,749
You shouldn't make such judgments
about someone else's.

154
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,294
Don't you know how hurtful that is?

155
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,842
Eun-pyo, we were just…

156
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,053
I mean, that's not what we meant.

157
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,890
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

158
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,395
I'll call you later.

159
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,626
What are you doing?

160
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,337
I'm going to transfer
Dong-seok to another school.

161
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,676
I know all of this
sounds absurd to you, but…

162
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,432
I can't raise our children
in such a freakish environment.

163
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,977
There's an alternative school
that I looked up a while ago.

164
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,979
Eun-yeong sends her kids there.

165
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,148
I think I should look into it.

166
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,488
Where is it?

167
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,240
Gapyeong.

168
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,493
Then what about me?

169
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,914
You're hardly ever home anyway.

170
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,292
You can find a studio
near the police station

171
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,669
and visit us once a week.

172
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,212
You know…

173
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,591
You're doing this
because you're embarrassed.

174
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,680
Wherever we go, there's always
going to be fierce competition.

175
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:16,809
But a boy can't run away all his life.

176
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,191
All they talk about in the neighborhood--

177
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,112
People gossip about Dong-seok.

178
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,699
Are you saying he has to put up
with that kind of humiliation?

179
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,284
What do you mean?

180
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,411
They say--

181
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,414
They say…

182
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,128
that nobody wants to be
in the same class as him.

183
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,756
Why should our child be treated like that?

184
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,599
PRIL LANGUAGE ACADEMY
ACADEMY JANG KOREAN ESSAY

185
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,269
SCIENCE EXPERIMENT REPORT
YOON MIN-JI

186
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,439
Okay, how about we take
a look at the bacteria

187
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,357
that we cultured last week

188
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,067
with a microscope?

189
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,318
Okay.

190
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,403
All right.

191
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:15,159
These are bacteria that
we collected from Yu-bin's dirty socks.

192
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,119
-Can you pass this, Min-ji?
-Hey.

193
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,162
That's what I'm saying.

194
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,748
Why did that woman
have to walk by at that moment?

195
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,751
-I was really surprised.
-Hey, I almost had a heart attack.

196
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,088
But it's not like
what we said wasn't true.

197
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,427
The boy is a troublemaker
and he disturbs the class.

198
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,845
Aren't those facts?

199
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,597
Now that I'm talking about it,
I'm getting angry.

200
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,766
She has some nerve to get angry.

201
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,226
We were the ones
that were annoyed but kept it in.

202
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,270
-Seriously.
-Goodness.

203
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,940
Whether you say it to her face,
or talk behind her back

204
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,486
you should've had a better response
instead of getting told off like that.

205
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,618
Goodness.

206
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,704
Dong-seok's family
put their house up for sale.

207
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,663
What?

208
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,542
Su-in's mom is freaking out,
asking what if it's because of her.

209
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,919
You're right.

210
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,546
Good.

211
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,927
Gosh, I can't believe her.

212
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,513
Lift it up. You too, Dong-seok.

213
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,181
Good, let's go.

214
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,599
Okay.

215
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,177
Don't do that.

216
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,432
Let's go.

217
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,937
PERSIMMON

218
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,689
BAMBOO

219
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,650
There's hardly
any infrastructure to speak of.

220
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:15,779
Plus, you have to sign an agreement
not to receive any private education.

221
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,700
If you're going to move here,
you can't half-commit.

222
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,829
-Mom, the clouds are really good too.
-Yes, it's really well done, isn't it?

223
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,419
Jin-ha.

224
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,298
When did you say your exhibition was?

225
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,465
It's in a month.

226
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,427
That's quite soon.
Did you get a lot of pieces done?

227
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,970
No.

228
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,472
But you're out and about like this?

229
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,601
Oh, but of course.

230
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,228
The confidence of
a Baloise Art Prize winner, am I right?

231
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,730
No, it's not that.

232
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,612
To be honest,

233
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,574
there's something
I've been really curious about.

234
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,920
But aren't you worried at all?

235
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,254
Why wouldn't I be?

236
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:18,508
Most families start to reconsider things
when their kids are in seventh grade.

237
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:24,014
But even so,
I studied so hard that I got sick of it.

238
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:28,393
I can't bring myself
to force that upon my kids.

239
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,691
Right.

240
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,027
You said you lived in Sangwe, right?

241
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,946
Did you meet Jin-ha?

242
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,740
Seo Jin-ha. Your best friend, right?

243
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,910
You know Eun-pyo, right?

244
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,245
Lee Eun-pyo.

245
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,872
Sure I do. She was one of your classmates.

246
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,916
The one you followed around all the time.

247
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,877
Yes.

248
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:58,632
I really liked Eun-pyo.

249
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,008
Eun-yeong.

250
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,595
You didn't know?
I didn't like her back then.

251
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,930
Why…

252
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,100
Why…

253
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,270
Why didn't she like me?

254
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,646
Who knows?

255
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,732
Was it my inferiority complex

256
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,151
or did I feel I wasn't good enough?

257
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,070
Or…

258
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,905
Jealousy?

259
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,657
Yes, jealousy.

260
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,617
Why…

261
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,121
Why was she jealous of me?
I'm nothing to be jealous of.

262
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:33,458
Eun-pyo had high aspirations
for herself, too.

263
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,044
But you always won all the awards

264
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,213
and the professors favored you.

265
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,341
So she must've hated seeing that.

266
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:48,223
You were probably the reason she stopped
painting and changed majors too.

267
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,935
"What a filthy world.
People only remember first place."

268
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,520
She probably thought that.

269
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,565
Oh, you…

270
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,321
I had no idea.

271
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,448
My existence

272
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,952
must've been painful for Eun-pyo.

273
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,060
Yu-bin's speaking improved quite a lot.

274
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,520
Oh, come on.

275
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,149
She's got a long way to go
to catch up with Yun-ji or Se-yeong.

276
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,443
I guess there's no big difference

277
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,278
between international schools
and normal ones anymore.

278
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,655
Chun-hui,

279
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,284
do they really make the kids study
past midnight in your neighborhood?

280
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,161
Yes.

281
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,329
Really?

282
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,290
You too?

283
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,543
Well, sometimes.

284
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,045
Right.

285
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,713
It sounded like
it was no joke after listening

286
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,590
to the Director of Top Tier Education.

287
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,675
Regardless of whether or not
the child is interested,

288
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,219
they just make them study.

289
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,264
Those poor little things have to
study so hard from such a young age.

290
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,766
That's got to be rough.

291
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:18,772
I'm just a wife to a penniless doctor,
so I don't really have another choice.

292
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,191
While you guys
can support your kids in any way.

293
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,276
Oh, please.

294
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,322
Your kids have a doctor as a father
so they're actually smart.

295
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,200
I heard Yeong-bin won a prize
at the Sungkyunkwan University contest.

296
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:34,955
Didn't he?

297
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,749
Oh, that reminds me.

298
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,378
I heard that Greenpeace will be hosting
an international children's conference.

299
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,005
Thunberg is doing a presentation.
It's being held in Belgium.

300
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,883
As far as environmental stuff goes,
it's a rare opportunity.

301
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,427
-Do you want to send your kids?
-I see. How much is it?

302
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,972
Sixty million per person,
and there are two spots left.

303
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,598
Oh, really? That's not bad.

304
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,518
I'll tell my secretary to give you a call.

305
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,061
What are the dates?

306
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,272
I don't think it's during the school year.

307
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,107
-That's a relief.
-Yes.

308
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,359
Bye.

309
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,611
Message me.

310
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,488
Yes, bye.

311
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,532
Bye.

312
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,919
No texting.

313
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,129
What?

314
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:29,426
Don't spend so much time
texting on the weekdays.

315
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:35,640
But Mom, why am I not going
to Belgium with them?

316
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,895
And why don't they go to academies?

317
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,358
Because they don't have to.

318
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,549
ROMANÉE-CONTI WINE

319
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,229
I heard that you're moving.

320
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:05,981
Yes.

321
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,444
I feel sorry for some reason.

322
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,656
No, there's no reason
for you to feel like that.

323
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,451
Kids all have their own pace.

324
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,870
I just never realized that.

325
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,684
I'll head down first.

326
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,978
Have a good night.

327
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,022
Okay.

328
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,710
CAN YOU MAKE A DELIVERY RIGHT NOW?

329
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:14,716
WHERE?

330
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,365
Gosh, I'm so exhausted.

331
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,290
Did you just wake up, Su-in?

332
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,458
Having trouble--

333
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,503
Wait, who are you?

334
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,004
Who are you?

335
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,549
Where am I?

336
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,053
Who are you?

337
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,264
Honey.

338
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,474
Who is…

339
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,600
Yu-bin.

340
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,770
Are you thirsty? Come here.

341
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,564
-Who is this?
-My friend asked me to look after her.

342
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,982
In the middle of the night?

343
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,985
Be quiet. You're going to wake the kids.

344
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,988
Go pee and come back out.

345
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,453
Why would you let the kid sleep
in the same room with a grown boy?

346
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,540
What grown boy? He's just a kid.

347
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,999
Look at him. He's all grown--

348
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,919
Seriously, just quiet down.
What's with all the fuss?

349
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,504
Take this and go in.

350
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,256
Who is it?

351
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,675
-Goodness.
-Yun-ju, it's me.

352
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:42,762
Chun-hui, the door's open.

353
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,933
-Go inside.
-Goodness.

354
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,644
Hello.

355
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,312
Mom.

356
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,190
What? What are you doing up so late?

357
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,485
She was sleeping
but she woke up to use the bathroom.

358
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,611
I see.

359
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,613
Thank you so much.

360
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,992
Something came up suddenly and
I didn't have anywhere else to send her.

361
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,202
My husband is busy with a patient.

362
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,831
Oh, please, don't mention it.
Let me go and wake Yeong-bin up.

363
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,541
Open!

364
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:15,086
You should've made time.
He was looking forward to it.

365
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,213
It's his last soccer game
in the neighborhood.

366
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,715
It would've been nice if you came.

367
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,093
I said I'd be home early around dinner.

368
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,303
Dong-seok, Dong-ju.

369
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,220
-Yes!
-Yes!

370
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,223
I'll come home early tonight
and play with you guys, okay?

371
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,516
-Okay!
-Okay!

372
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,644
-We're going to the soccer field!
-Bye.

373
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,274
I'll do well!

374
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,525
Eun-pyo.

375
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,157
I heard you were moving.

376
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,327
Is it because of me?

377
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,290
No, it's not because of you.

378
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,002
It's none of your business.

379
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,796
Eun-pyo.

380
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,216
I'm sorry.

381
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,638
I think there were a lot of things
I never got to know about you.

382
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,978
Why would you
need to know anything about me?

383
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,941
Dad, that tickles.

384
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,235
Eun-pyo.

385
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,753
Lee Su-in, you're doing great!

386
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,056
Eun-pyo.

387
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,520
I saw you put your place up for sale.

388
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,778
I mean…

389
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,532
I was just going to listen to them talk,

390
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,077
but then I thought
it'd be too awkward not to join in…

391
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,003
Eun-pyo.

392
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,590
Your husband's not here today?

393
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:26,843
Hey.

394
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,970
I want to ask you a favor.

395
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,764
From now on,

396
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,225
can you pretend you don't know me?

397
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,395
It may not be a big deal for you,

398
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,523
but I don't want other people
to know about my past.

399
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,443
And stop talking to me in French.

400
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,528
I forgot all of it.

401
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,621
You're doing great, Dong-seok!

402
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,999
-Take it and run!
-Look at the ball!

403
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,168
Pass, Dong-seok!

404
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,048
Get up!

405
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,634
You're doing such a good job, Dong-seok!

406
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,093
-Pass!
-Jae-bin!

407
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,053
Go in.

408
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,555
That's it!

409
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,683
Hey!

410
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,689
-What?
-What was that?

411
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,690
What is that?

412
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,902
-What was that?
-Is this handball or what?

413
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,946
-Yun-ju.
-You're here.

414
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,406
-Where's Su-in?
-Su-in's right there.

415
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,159
-Su-in, you can do it!
-That's it!

416
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,912
Stay calm! That's it. Pass!

417
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,372
-Su-in!
-That's it!

418
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,416
-That's it, Su-in!
-Go!

419
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,890
I'm so happy!

420
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,268
That's it!

421
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,188
That's my daughter!

422
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,148
Su-in!

423
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,026
My daughter is the best!

424
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,111
Mom!

425
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,488
Su-in!

426
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,489
Mom!

427
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,451
You did so well.

428
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,901
Hello?

429
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,196
You don't have to come.

430
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,781
What? I'm almost there.

431
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,866
Where?

432
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,242
I parked my car just now.

433
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,080
Then stay there and don't come in.

434
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,041
I'll head out with Yu-bin.

435
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,042
What?

436
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,169
-What?
-My daughter.

437
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,920
-Yu-bin, let's go.
-What?

438
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,380
Let's go.

439
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,798
What do you want to eat?

440
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,009
-Galbi.
-Galbi?

441
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,844
-Bye.
-We're leaving.

442
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,012
-Where are you going?
-You want the berries?

443
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,263
Stay for lunch.

444
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,062
Why did you come?
I told you to wait for us.

445
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,523
There's nothing to do in the parking lot.
You should've called me sooner.

446
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,358
-Did you play well?
-Yes.

447
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,651
Let's get going.

448
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,652
Let's go.

449
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,529
What?

450
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,531
Mr. Lee Man-su?

451
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,869
-It's Mr. Lee, right?
-Yes. How have you been, sir?

452
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:43,498
This is crazy.
Who would've thought we'd meet here?

453
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,834
Honey, don't you remember?

454
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,129
He's Mr. Lee Man-su who used to
supply medicine to our hospital.

455
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,255
Right.

456
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,757
He is.

457
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,054
Honey, who is this? Introduce us.

458
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,432
-This is my wife.
-I see.

459
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,810
This is Dr. Kim Ju-seok,
an anesthesiologist at Eulju Hospital.

460
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,896
We used to do business
when I worked at Sunghan Pharmaceutical.

461
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,648
Hello, Doctor Kim.

462
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,233
Nice to meet you.

463
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:14,112
Jeez, what a small world.

464
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,740
Actually, our children are
in the same class.

465
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,033
Is that so?

466
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,369
-My goodness.
-Hello.

467
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,955
-This is our daughter.
-Nice to meet you.

468
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,581
-Did you have a good game?
-Yes.

469
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,459
-Gosh, you must be so proud.
-Yes.

470
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,338
What are you doing? Have some.

471
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,340
-Here, take this.
-Okay.

472
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,929
Eat up.

473
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,599
I wanted to buy you
a drink before you quit.

474
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,144
Gosh, here we are
finally having a meal together.

475
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,186
Yes.

476
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,438
We shouldn't have said goodbye like that.

477
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,525
You're very kind.
It must be because you're a doctor.

478
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,445
The meat here is delicious. Right, Honey?

479
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,655
Eat as much as you want.

480
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,990
-Yes.
-Hurry up and eat.

481
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,241
Where do you work now?

482
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,494
-I'm with Pharm de Lyon.
-Oh, Pharm de Lyon?

483
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,747
OTC? ETC?

484
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,624
ETC.

485
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,251
Oh, ETC?

486
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,589
You should drop by our hospital sometime.

487
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:16,883
Sure.

488
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,093
Please enjoy.

489
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,888
Beef like this tastes great
even when it's not fully cooked.

490
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,389
You're right.

491
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,725
Is it not good?

492
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,102
-No, it's good.
-All right.

493
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,565
It's so good.

494
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,652
Here.

495
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,613
I ate a lot.

496
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,281
The bill's already been paid.

497
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,785
Are you serious? Come on.

498
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,663
Jeez, I was a step behind again.

499
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,748
No, not at all.

500
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,292
It's only right that I treat you.
I owe you a lot.

501
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,336
Thank you for the meal.

502
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,340
-Did you eat a lot?
-I ate so much.

503
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,718
Honey, you used the corporate card, right?

504
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,137
-You used the corporate card, right?
-Gosh, please.

505
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,565
He got fired for sneaking drugs, right?

506
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,820
He doesn't look it,
but he's got some nerve.

507
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,699
I guess he still wants to be a man.
Look at him swipe his card.

508
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,827
Gosh, he's become more pretentious.

509
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,289
Darn it.

510
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,875
That prick wouldn't
go around saying things, right?

511
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,379
Of course, not.
If he has any sense in him.

512
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,257
Wash everything.

513
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,561
Are you out of your mind?

514
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,523
You're not right in the head, are you?

515
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,694
I mean, why would you
be concerned about saving face?

516
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,612
You ate the most out of everyone there.

517
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,739
They have a doctor in the family.

518
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,325
So what if they buy us a meal?

519
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,620
Jeez, stop. I can treat people to a meal.

520
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,247
It was 370,000 won!

521
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,709
It was 370,000 won!

522
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,504
We can't even afford
to send Su-in to all her academies.

523
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,882
How do you have anything to say
after spending that money?

524
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,721
-Hey!
-Jeez, stop it already!

525
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,472
Gosh…

526
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,059
Goodness.

527
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,494
What? Grandma.

528
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,206
Hello.

529
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,499
Hello.

530
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,501
Hello.

531
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,756
Why are you doing this?

532
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,886
Do you know how big
of a loss this is for me?

533
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,013
I'm sorry.

534
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,640
I never said a word
when you neglected the boys

535
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,434
so you could study.

536
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,312
You must know how upset I was.

537
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,231
I even gave you this place
because I was worried

538
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,858
you would neglect them again.

539
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,611
You should be thanking me for all this,

540
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,154
but now you're moving?

541
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,574
What about Jae-ung?

542
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,619
To tell you the truth,

543
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,206
Jae-ung only ever comes home
about once or twice a week--

544
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,248
So what?

545
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,418
You're going to abandon your husband
and move to the country by yourselves?

546
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:44,256
What kind of nonsense is this?

547
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,469
The kids will be missing out
on any kind of proper education,

548
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,181
and on top of that,
you'll be breaking up your family!

549
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,766
Is that really

550
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:57,395
the best plan someone who almost
became a professor can come up with?

551
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,687
Gosh!

552
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:07,780
Gosh, you're home all day
and this is what your fridge looks like?

553
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,741
Jeez.

554
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,129
Mother.

555
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,386
I know how much effort
you put into caring for us

556
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,888
and I'm truly sorry
that I had to make this decision,

557
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,601
but this isn't fair.

558
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,106
Why is the fact that
I didn't give up on my dreams

559
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,608
seen as a crime against my family?

560
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,861
All I wanted

561
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,906
was to live my best life.

562
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,617
What? What did you say?

563
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,456
I'm going to get some fresh air.

564
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,167
Where do you think you're going?
I'm still talking to you.

565
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,918
Mom, let's calm down.

566
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,338
-Jeez, where's your pride?
-That hurts!

567
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,508
Are you still going to
stand up for your wife right now?

568
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:36,911
I sent my mom home. I'll watch the kids,
so take your time and get some fresh air.

569
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,398
DIGESTIVE DRINK

570
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,140
What are you guys studying so hard for?

571
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,187
I can't sleep. Come in.

572
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,461
The cloud looks like a puppy.

573
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,715
Is it a cloud or a puppy?

574
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:13,882
A cloud.

575
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,219
-Is it for a presentation?
-Yes.

576
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,680
You're really good at drawing hearts now.

577
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,932
-Is that you, Su-in?
-Yes.

578
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,476
-Who's that?
-Yu-bin.

579
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,229
-Yu-bin?
-Yes.

580
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,194
Are you and Yu-bin close friends?

581
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:38,240
Yes, we're in the same class
and we also go to the same academy.

582
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,326
Which academy is that?

583
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,869
The academy for gifted students.

584
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,959
Where does Yu-bin live?

585
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,641
Over there, at Wonderful Views.

586
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,976
Building 902.

587
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:14,777
WONDERFUL VIEWS

588
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,094
Mom, did something happen with that man?

589
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,138
What?

590
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:47,476
Well, Dad said "he wouldn't go around
saying things, right?"

591
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,106
Stop talking nonsense
and work on your equations.

592
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,030
ELEMENTARY MATH 4

593
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:09,790
Thank you.

594
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,580
What about the kids?

595
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,167
My husband came home early
for the first time in a while.

596
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,961
He told me to get some fresh air
while he watches the kids.

597
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,797
But…

598
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,634
I didn't really have anywhere to go.

599
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,937
There's actually a place
that I wanted to go to.

600
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,692
Do you want to go together?

601
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,910
Bottom's up!

602
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,083
Your lips are purple.

603
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,878
Yours are purple too.

604
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,421
Really? Mine are purple too?

605
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,176
That's okay.

606
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,724
Hey.

607
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,767
Yes?

608
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,479
Can I ask you something?

609
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,648
What is it?

610
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,946
-What if…
-Yes?

611
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,576
What?

612
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,161
What is it?

613
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,663
No, it's nothing.

614
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,167
If…

615
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,168
Okay.

616
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,753
-"If," okay?
-Yes.

617
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,006
If you ran into…

618
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,094
your ex-boyfriend in the neighborhood,

619
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:12,014
how do you think you'd feel?

620
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:20,355
Oh, I'd be pissed off.

621
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,065
What does that mean?

622
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,570
"I'd be pissed."

623
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,869
I know exactly what you mean.

624
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,711
Oh, you're hilarious.

625
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,838
You're right.

626
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,923
That's exactly how it feels.

627
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,138
Can I tell you something too?

628
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:56,099
Of course. Ask me anything. What is it?

629
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,354
To tell you the truth,

630
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,481
I'm not a professor.

631
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,693
You didn't know that, did you?

632
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,863
I actually got fired!

633
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:23,835
And this whole time
you were saying you couldn't lie.

634
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,630
No. I'm an excellent liar.

635
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,465
Liar.

636
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,634
Liar!

637
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,552
Liar.

638
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,597
What's your name?

639
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,852
Eun-pyo.

640
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,063
Lee Eun-pyo.

641
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,233
That's a pretty name.

642
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,151
Lee Eun-pyo.

643
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:53,865
-Have a drink, Eun-pyo.
-Cheers!

644
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,867
Taxi!

645
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,035
Taxi!

646
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,747
-Jeez, the taxis are so…
-Oh, man.

647
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,500
It's coming.

648
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,920
-Taxi!
-Taxi!

649
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,964
Taxi!

650
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,217
-Come on.
-Come on, taxi.

651
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,137
-Come on, taxi…
-Come here.

652
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,346
It's dangerous.

653
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:20,892
-Why is it so hard to get a taxi?
-Hang on a second.

654
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,438
Taxi.

655
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,080
I'm so jealous.

656
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,751
You have friends who come out
as soon as you call them.

657
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,712
You two must be best friends.

658
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,257
Yes, we're best friends.

659
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:59,890
Jeez, where did you find yourself
such a cool and handsome guy friend?

660
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:02,350
You're so talented.

661
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,191
Thank you.

662
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:14,112
Chun-hui, get out. Let's go for round two.

663
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,867
Let's go for round two!

664
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,582
Where are you going?
We have something to take care of.

665
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,876
Not today, let's do it later.

666
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,129
Later when? You ignore all my calls.

667
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:34,299
What are you doing?
I'm with someone right now.

668
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,510
What? Open the door.

669
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,262
Open the door!

670
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,389
-What are you doing?
-Chun-hui!

671
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,725
-Open the door!
-Stay still!

672
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,187
Open the door! Hey!

673
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,375
Damn it.

674
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,426
-Come on.
-Look at you.

675
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,638
Jeez, I can't believe this.

676
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,809
Like I said, she couldn't get a taxi
and she asked me to take her home,

677
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,310
so that's what I did.

678
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,812
But then…

679
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:33,483
Damn it, she suddenly threw
a bottle of wine at my car.

680
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,780
You were trying to kidnap her!

681
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,448
I saw it.

682
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,743
You were trying to kidnap her!

683
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,579
You're a funny man.

684
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,832
Ma'am, can you tell me
how you know this man?

685
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,005
I don't.

686
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,464
Goodness.

687
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,217
What are you trying to do right now?

688
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:03,138
You want me to tell everyone about us?

689
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,474
Is it okay if I do that?

690
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:09,895
-Detective.
-Yes.

691
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:13,023
-Go out and check the car.
-What?

692
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,734
There are scratches everywhere.

693
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,694
I'll go have a look later.

694
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,613
You're drunk right now, so just hold on.

695
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,574
She's the one who's drunk.
I haven't had a single drink.

696
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,076
Jeez.

697
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,995
Hey! What are you doing here?

698
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,250
Hello.

699
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,767
Chun-hui.

700
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,315
Gosh.

701
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,692
Lady!

702
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:09,204
-Jeez.
-You're completely nuts!

703
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,163
You threw the wine…

704
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,706
Jae-ung.

705
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,458
Eun-pyo came to the station

706
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,669
and she was completely wasted.

707
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,395
Chun-hui,
I'm telling you this is really easy.

708
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,813
Okay, be careful.

709
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:35,730
Watch!

710
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:36,940
-Be careful.
-Here I go!

711
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,651
-Here I go!
-Chun-hui!

712
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,570
-Seriously!
-Chun-hui!

713
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,284
No, I can't do it!

714
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,037
Come on. You can do it!

715
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,498
-Hold onto me tight.
-Come on.

716
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,000
Lift your leg.

717
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,002
There you go.

718
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:58,920
Wait!

719
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,130
Wait!

720
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,593
-Chun-hui.
-Seriously.

721
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,179
-What are we even doing?
-You have to be quick!

722
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,347
Get up!

723
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,350
It hurts! Get up.

724
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,360
Hey! Have you lost your mind?

725
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,779
It's the middle of the night!

726
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:29,200
Hey, you're lucky Dong-sik knew him,
or else you would've been charged!

727
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,911
-Be quiet. You're so loud.
-Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

728
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:32,829
How much…

729
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,372
Hey, wait!

730
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,910
Lie down properly, come on.

731
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,830
Goodness.

732
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,384
TRAFFIC SAFETY
STOP

733
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,864
I'm going to head out first.

734
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,950
All right. Good work today.

735
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,608
I wanted to make up before I leave.

736
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,113
Just…

737
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,199
blame it on my inferiority complex.

738
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,702
When this all passes,

739
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,745
it won't be a big deal.

740
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,290
Anyway…

741
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,793
let's meet in good spirits
the next time we see each other.

742
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:48,256
Take care of your health,
and good luck with your exhibition.

743
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,593
Wait, Eun-pyo.

744
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,475
I…

745
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:03,104
have something
I've been wanting to ask you.

746
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,359
INCOMING CALL

747
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,737
One second.

748
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,156
Hello?

749
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,492
Someone came to look at your place.
Where are you?

750
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,202
Oh, okay.

751
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,370
I'll be there in a minute.

752
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,000
Sorry, but can we talk some other time?

753
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,669
Sure.

754
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:42,018
That place uses too much MSG.
It's not that good.

755
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,103
Let's go to the
hot pot rice place next door.

756
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,563
It's good there.

757
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,149
Quiet down.

758
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,362
-Did everyone finish all their questions?
-Yes.

759
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:56,991
Ma'am, Oh Jul-pin and Jung Dong-seok
still haven't finished theirs.

760
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:01,996
Goodness.

761
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,048
Does your mom not help you?

762
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,352
-Hello.
-Hello.

763
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,937
-Should we go in?
-Please come in.

764
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,605
Yes. Take a look around.

765
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,148
It's a south-facing unit.

766
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,068
So a lot of light comes in
and the view is wonderful.

767
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,987
-It's really nice.
-Yes.

768
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,824
I can even see the park there.

769
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,993
-The view is amazing.
-You're right.

770
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,787
-It's very high.
-It's nice, right?

771
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,415
There's an elementary school
right out front.

772
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,875
A child's happiness
is not based on grades!

773
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,545
Educational background
doesn't define a person!

774
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:54,882
It's rare to see a child
that can't solve basic equations.

775
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,510
So when they feel like
they are falling behind,

776
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,804
it can be intimidating for the student.

777
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,806
Happiness isn't based on any grade, is it?

778
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,808
But, Ma'am.

779
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:06,311
I intentionally didn't teach them.

780
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,065
Don't you think forcing students
to study ahead of the curriculum

781
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,900
only kills their curiosity?

782
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,360
Oh, Ms. Kim…

783
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,908
You're a very philosophical person,
aren't you?

784
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,411
But the thing is…

785
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:28,291
that doesn't matter when your child starts
to feel like they're less than others.

786
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:29,626
It's not based on grades!

787
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:34,005
If you go to any bookstore,
you'll find a lot of equation books.

788
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,383
It's not that he's not a bright child.

789
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,427
You just need to put in a bit more effort.

790
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,512
I'm not sure why you're leaving him as is.

791
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,098
-Seriously.
-I cannot help but denounce this.

792
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,393
Ma'am, I think you're a bit out of line.

793
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:51,814
I'm busy right now,
so let's talk again later. Bye.

794
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,409
Goodness me.

795
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,673
So if you take a look right here…

796
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,633
MATH UNIT ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS

797
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:32,772
What do we do?

798
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,108
Good morning!

799
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,116
What's going on?

800
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,327
Ms. Hwang, who is this person?

801
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,788
Did you have problems with this person?

802
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:52,375
I would like to be a mother.

803
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,584
PARENTS BULLETIN BOARD
KIM YEONG-MI

804
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,837
I hope you'll be reading this,

805
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,506
Ms. Hwang Jung-sook,
homeroom teacher of Grade 1 Class 3.

806
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:02,385
I am a mother and not a teacher.

807
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:05,430
I despise the fact
that the moms in this country

808
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,725
are expected to fulfill the duties
of both a teacher and a manager,

809
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:13,521
all while neglecting to tend
to their true missions as moms.

810
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,356
With that being said,

811
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,526
for you to order me
to make my child study at home

812
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,862
is to neglect your duties as a teacher,

813
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,947
and only serves
to promote the continuation

814
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,866
of our discriminatory education system.

815
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:28,828
As a public servant
who lives off of my tax money,

816
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,789
I hope that you'll take responsibility

817
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,292
-for my child's elementary education.
-She's gone mad.

818
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:37,837
I'll be sharing this issue
on the official homepage

819
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,132
of the Office of Education and
drafting up a national petition as well.

820
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,342
I look forward to hearing back from you

821
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,637
with a well-thought-out
and sincere response.

822
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:51,434
I've called everyone here for one reason.

823
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:56,147
After sensing the impending danger
of this diseased public education system,

824
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,524
I felt that I could no longer keep quiet.

825
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:03,154
So, after careful consideration,

826
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:04,906
I could only come to one conclusion.

827
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:08,159
We must get rid of
the gifted students' program

828
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,495
that encourages private
and early education,

829
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:13,498
including the recommendation letters
for gifted students as well.

830
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:18,503
We woke mothers need to gather around
and work together as a unit.

831
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:19,962
Says who?

832
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,132
This is ridiculous.

833
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,595
Do you think it's okay
to ruin someone else's cake

834
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,847
just because you can't have a bite?

835
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,100
And then you try to make it sound like

836
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,977
this is for the community?

837
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,437
Dong-seok's mother?

838
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:38,773
Yes.

839
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,779
This country depends
only on human resources.

840
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:48,616
So raising gifted children is for
the good of the country as well.

841
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,370
That's why the Ministry of Education
has been pushing

842
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,747
the gifted student agenda
for the past 20 years.

843
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,875
And that's why
the ill caused by it is serious.

844
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,962
Would you like me to be brutally honest?

845
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,673
You're only doing this

846
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:09,595
to get back at the teacher
because Jul-pin was embarrassed at school.

847
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:14,684
You're hiding your grudge
with all those grand-sounding words.

848
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:40,585
This is why we were confused.

849
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,590
He never does any
of the multiple-choice questions.

850
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,216
So I asked him why,

851
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:51,971
and he said they're just not fun.

852
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:55,391
So I tried giving him some
advanced problems to solve.

853
01:04:55,474 --> 01:05:00,271
And the way he solved
those problems was astonishing.

854
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,864
IF YOU PUT 5 SQUARES TOGETHER,
YOU GET 12 SIDES…

855
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,240
But…

856
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,369
to be honest…

857
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:24,003
I don't agree with
what Yu-bin's mother is saying.

858
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,719
Based on the test results,

859
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:35,389
Dong-seok is a gifted child
who ranks in the highest percentile.

860
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:40,061
Especially when it comes to
his spatial perception,

861
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:44,523
he fits somewhere
in the top 0.01 percent among his peers.

862
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:46,168
They say he's a highly gifted child
who's in the top 0.01 percent.

863
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:49,005
I agree that there should be
a class for gifted students.

864
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,172
I heard you're not moving.

865
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,092
Does that mean there's a chance
for us to be close friends again?

866
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,053
You can never be too cautious
as married individuals.

867
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:58,806
But when you first saw me, why…

868
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:02,601
If you keep disrespecting my son,
I'm not going to let it slide.

869
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,353
Hey! Jung Dong-seok!

870
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,647
You did a complete 180 on your stance.

871
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,524
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

872
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,860
That I made someone croak.

873
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,528
I'm sorry,

874
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:16,741
but I don't like to mix my personal
relationships with my child's education.

875
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:20,119
Why not try betting on someone new?

876
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:26,500
