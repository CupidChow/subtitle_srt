1
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,909
I knew something was off.

2
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,036
She's not one to just die like that.

3
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,581
How dare you come here
and act like you care?

4
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,499
You little…

5
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,875
You killed her.

6
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,085
You killed her!

7
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,962
Bring her back! You killed her!

8
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,547
What are you doing?

9
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,800
She didn't kill your daughter.

10
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,009
What do you know?

11
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,260
I'm…

12
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,096
her husband.

13
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,766
What is he saying?

14
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,975
Husband?

15
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,060
Let's go.

16
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,311
A detective?

17
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,148
That detective is Dong-seok's father?

18
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,235
-Did you know?
-No, not at all.

19
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,487
That's what I'm saying.

20
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,365
Nothing about her is clear.

21
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,826
Whatever she says is a lie.

22
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,913
Jeez, I'll just have to think
that I got bit by a crazy dog.

23
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,291
-You didn't know either?
-Of course, I didn't.

24
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,003
She never even told me about it.

25
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,719
Let's stop talking about this.

26
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,972
We still used to be close to her.

27
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,813
Chun-hui, about that letter…

28
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,440
Did you actually get a letter?

29
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,947
I mean…

30
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,834
This one?

31
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,089
My goodness, Chun-hui.

32
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,925
It was real. My goodness.

33
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,053
Jeez, I'm getting goosebumps. Look.

34
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,014
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR WICKED DEEDS
EVEN IN DEATH

35
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,181
My goodness.

36
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:07,020
Dong-seok's mom told me that she found it
in her mailbox and brought it to me.

37
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,272
She said it was put in
her mailbox by accident.

38
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,316
In her mailbox?

39
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,986
I thought it was
a bit strange at the time,

40
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,863
but I just shrugged it off.

41
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,325
I didn't feel like questioning her
since we were close.

42
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,202
I brought this with me
so I could ask about it,

43
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,623
but she left as soon as she got here
like she was running away.

44
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,919
Then do you think
she came up with the letter?

45
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,671
Well, who knows?

46
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,923
That's it.

47
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:41,554
Dong-seok's mom
does look extremely nervous.

48
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,640
-You're right.
-She does.

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,397
The fact that she got slapped definitely
means she got caught doing something.

50
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,233
It's not something you see every day.

51
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,817
You're right.

52
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,404
Jeez, how despicable.
It's giving me the chills.

53
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,322
Goodness.

54
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,448
Su-in's mom.

55
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,658
-Yes?
-Come over here.

56
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,534
My goodness…

57
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,620
Jeez.

58
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,622
I'm just going to run to the bathroom.

59
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,874
-Go ahead.
-Yes.

60
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,944
EPISODE 8
YOUR DOWNRIGHT LIE

61
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:38,987
Goodness!

62
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,578
It's okay.

63
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,872
Whatever.

64
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,502
Let's see if Su-in had dinner.

65
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,546
My gosh.

66
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,803
-What?
-Did the kids eat?

67
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:04,846
Yes.

68
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,347
-What did they eat?
-Fried chicken.

69
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,393
How can you eat that when you've
sold it for so many years?

70
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,020
You brat.

71
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,398
Do you know how delicious
chicken fried in high-quality oil is?

72
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,443
-What about Su-in's homework?
-I don't know.

73
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,987
How would I know anything about that?

74
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,991
Jeez. Put Su-in on the phone.

75
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,994
Miss Su-in.

76
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,789
It's your mom.

77
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,459
Hey, Mom.

78
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,502
Su-in, did you finish your homework?

79
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,296
What about the worksheets and textbook?

80
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,758
I finished all of it.
I did all of the worksheets

81
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,469
and I did ten pages of the textbook.

82
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,762
And…

83
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:50,308
I also read all five of my books.

84
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:54,395
Good girl. What are you doing right now?

85
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,356
I'm doing origami with Hye-rim.

86
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,442
Su-in, Mommy's going to be home soon

87
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,402
so be good and listen to your aunt, okay?

88
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,487
Okay.

89
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,157
Hey, try and make more cranes.

90
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,534
The cranes look so pretty
when we paint them.

91
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,660
Okay.

92
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:20,254
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR WICKED DEEDS

93
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,934
Chun-hui.

94
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,315
Are you out of your mind?

95
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,359
What if someone sees us?

96
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,842
I overheard people talking at the funeral.

97
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,803
They said you were
the last to visit her place.

98
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,973
You just went for a friendly visit, right?

99
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,474
Nothing happened, right?

100
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,847
LET ME KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED.
I WON'T CONTACT YOU FIRST.

101
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,786
Mom, are we going to start
Reading Gate now?

102
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,121
Right.

103
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,248
Dad's tablet seems to be broken too.

104
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,000
How about…

105
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,795
we do something from the reading list?

106
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,943
What?

107
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,114
What are you doing with the lights off?

108
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,279
Man-su.

109
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,288
My daughter is
the most important thing to me.

110
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,922
So I'm going to let this one slide.

111
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,469
But if you ever do this again,

112
00:09:56,512 --> 00:10:00,850
we're really going to get a divorce.

113
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,127
What's wrong?

114
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,381
Did something happen?

115
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,759
No.

116
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,887
Then what's with the look on your face?

117
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,685
It's nothing.

118
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,733
I just feel bad for their kid.

119
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:04,997
See?

120
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,500
What did I tell you?

121
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,671
I knew something was strange.

122
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,552
You killed her.

123
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,763
My Jin-ha.

124
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,559
You're doing this to me…

125
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,979
because of your guilt, aren't you?

126
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,652
Jin-ha would always talk about…

127
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,782
how she wanted to forgive you.

128
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,079
Do you see?

129
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,249
I didn't kill Jin-ha.

130
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,585
You did.

131
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:33,711
HANDMADE JAM
MADE BY ENLIGHTENED SANGWE MOMS

132
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,467
How are my son

133
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,888
and daughter doing…

134
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,267
these days?

135
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,853
Sae-bom.

136
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,606
Do you keep in touch with Dad?

137
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,152
I'm not scolding you.

138
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,321
It's not that.

139
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,617
I just…

140
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,622
Never mind.

141
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,876
Good night.

142
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,432
Hello,

143
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,767
Ms. Nam.

144
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,521
Yes, hello.

145
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,654
Have we not closed the Sangwe case yet?

146
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,115
They had the funeral, right?

147
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,284
Yes, they finished
the burial two days ago.

148
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,578
So it's for sure a suicide case.

149
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,495
Wrap it up.

150
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,707
We haven't received a final report
from the National Forensic Service yet.

151
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,919
We only did that
because the bereaved kept asking for it.

152
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,046
You can tell them the final results later.

153
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,756
How much longer are you going to wait?

154
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,634
There are still
a couple of questionable aspects.

155
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,471
The last visitor exaggerated
how this case affected her

156
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,307
-and the husband didn't seem to be fazed--
-Come on.

157
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,768
You know how acquaintances can overreact.

158
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,937
The sexual assault case in Daewe-dong

159
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,814
is all over the media,
so start working on that case.

160
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,982
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

161
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,901
The meeting's over. Get moving!

162
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,925
What business would I have
meeting up with the wife of a doctor?

163
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,428
She sometimes came to the bar

164
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,807
and the guys just wanted to
get picked by her.

165
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,268
Then what was with
all the threats that night?

166
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,440
Gentlemen. I mean…

167
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,193
-This punk…
-Detectives.

168
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,737
Did you set up
a private detective agency or something?

169
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,240
Are you going to rat her out
to her husband?

170
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,492
You little punk.

171
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,327
Damn.

172
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,122
Hey.

173
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,542
You also set up solicitations, right?

174
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,921
Offering companionship is more of a hobby

175
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,382
while pimping is your main job.

176
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,221
I don't have any more work.

177
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,934
All the girls who worked for me
started new lives.

178
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,315
So you're saying…

179
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,862
you and Byeon Chun-hui
only met up at the bar?

180
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,325
Jeez.

181
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,392
What is it that you want to talk about?

182
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,061
Right.

183
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,646
It's nothing big.

184
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,737
You're the one who sent me this letter.

185
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,364
I did?

186
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,866
Why do you think I sent it?

187
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,118
Do you have any evidence?

188
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,454
You're ridiculous.

189
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,626
Why did you do it?

190
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,377
Why?

191
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,507
Is it because
I'm your husband's ex-girlfriend?

192
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,092
That's right.

193
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,386
Man-su and I used to date briefly.

194
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,764
You're so brazen!

195
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,558
How can you bring that up so nonchalantly?

196
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,186
Don't you feel sorry at all?

197
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,481
Why would I?

198
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,485
It's not like I was having
an affair like someone.

199
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,862
And it's not like
your husband is your first love.

200
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,452
Yes.

201
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,995
I did send this to you.

202
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,125
If you did something bad,
you'd have a guilty conscience.

203
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,252
It sure seems like
you're guilty of something.

204
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,920
You still crossed the line!

205
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,588
What are you, a kid?

206
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,221
I'm still mad about your childish act.

207
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,974
But I called you today

208
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,687
because I believe you still have
your child's best interests at heart.

209
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,481
So let's just pretend
that this letter never existed.

210
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,570
No good can come of it
if everyone else finds out.

211
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,081
Then why did you meet
my husband again that day?

212
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:28,917
Me?

213
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:33,005
I saw you talking
to my husband in the parking lot!

214
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,300
What did the two of you talk about?

215
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,470
Were you talking about going out again?

216
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,435
Goodness.

217
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,771
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

218
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,108
He's putting me in a very awkward spot.

219
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,821
He still has feelings left for me
and can't help but keep trying.

220
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,951
Go and let him know, would you?
Tell him to stop calling me.

221
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,662
I have no idea

222
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,082
why he would want to cheat on you
when you're such a wonderful wife.

223
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,838
Bye.

224
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,557
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

225
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,813
Hey.

226
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,024
Is today a special occasion?

227
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,028
Jeez.

228
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,656
What's going on?

229
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,534
What's making someone
as stingy as you go all out tonight?

230
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,253
Are you not going to do anything?

231
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,340
Are you just going to let her frame you?

232
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,968
She's horrible.

233
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,513
As soon as you left the funeral,
Yu-bin's mom showed the letter…

234
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,891
She said you're taking all the blame

235
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,644
because it's true that you had
an affair with Henry's dad.

236
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,818
Eun-pyo.

237
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,489
Are you really going to
let her label you as a mistress?

238
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,283
What do you suggest I do?

239
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,910
Should I go and start
that dirty fight again?

240
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,246
Until only one of us is left standing?

241
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,001
I want this whole thing to be over.

242
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:38,255
As long as my family is on my side,
I'll be okay.

243
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,215
It's not like…

244
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,304
I didn't do anything
wrong to Jin-ha either.

245
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,726
I just want to focus on
raising my kids properly.

246
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,354
Even if you open up to a friend,

247
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,358
they're still strangers in the end.

248
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,620
Let's just enjoy our food.

249
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,678
Make sure he doesn't go
into the middle of the road.

250
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,513
Don't be on your phone the whole time.

251
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,224
You can't be distracted
when looking after the kids, okay?

252
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,267
All right.

253
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,894
Aren't you going to leave?

254
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,188
I'm going.

255
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,441
Are you waiting to wish him good luck?

256
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,277
Yes. Dong-seok.

257
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,407
Gosh, I'm so proud of you, little man.
Good luck today, okay?

258
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,827
-Dong-seok!
-All right.

259
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,953
Dong-seok!

260
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,679
Why are you so dressed up today?

261
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,642
Eun-pyo, today is the day
Su-in will make all my wishes come true.

262
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,269
My wish was to take a picture
in front of Geoseong University.

263
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,815
I should dress up
if I want to look good in photos.

264
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,442
How do I look? Do I look pretty?

265
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,821
You do look pretty great.

266
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,115
All right, guys. Are you ready?

267
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,491
-Yes.
-Let's go!

268
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,497
Can you take a picture?

269
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,208
Su-in, come here.
Let's take a picture before you go in.

270
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,001
-Here?
-Yes, right here.

271
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,420
-Get the whole thing in the back.
-All right.

272
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,840
Okay. One, two, three.

273
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,008
One, two, three.

274
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,885
That was a good one.

275
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,012
How do we look? Let me see.

276
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,348
It's nice, isn't it?

277
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,433
You have to take one too.

278
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,977
-I'm fine.
-Stand right there.

279
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,146
Excuse me.
Do you mind taking a photo for us?

280
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,981
-Sure.
-Thank you.

281
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,026
-Take a whole bunch of them, please.
-Sure.

282
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,779
One, two, three.

283
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,115
One, two, three.

284
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,704
Okay, so the enemy is approaching swiftly

285
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,416
and you have to build a bridge
as fast as possible in order to survive.

286
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,254
How can we build a bridge
without having to use any nails?

287
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,465
-Su-in, can you hold this part up for me?
-Okay.

288
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,138
Just a second.

289
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,858
Any kids that stand out?

290
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,819
It's their first day. How would we know?

291
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:56,995
There we go.

292
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,330
That's awesome.

293
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,790
Sir, our team is done.

294
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,751
Already?

295
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,377
Okay, shall we have a look?

296
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,506
Who's idea was this?

297
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,508
It was his idea.

298
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,677
All right.

299
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:17,599
Dong-seok, did you learn about
Leonardo da Vinci's bridge at an academy?

300
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,643
-No.
-Then?

301
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:23,271
I saw it in a magazine on my mom's desk.

302
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,356
I see.

303
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,199
Excuse me. Dong-seok's mother.

304
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,369
You're Dong-seok's mother, right?

305
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,537
Yes.

306
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,499
Hello, I'm a writer
from JBC's Genius Kids Show.

307
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:46,044
I met Dong-seok earlier in class
and he was quite the bright young boy.

308
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,088
I see.

309
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,091
I heard he also won the grand prize
at the Rube Goldberg contest.

310
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:55,553
So I was wondering if you're interested
in having him on our show.

311
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,432
I'm not sure.

312
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,767
Right.

313
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,062
It could be a great experience
for your child.

314
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,775
I'm not saying you have to make
a decision right now.

315
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:12,153
You can think about it and give me a call.

316
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,989
I come here quite often.

317
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:14,948
Okay.

318
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,034
All right, then. Bye.

319
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,370
-Bye, Dong-seok.
-Bye.

320
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,834
WRITER MIN YU-JU
GENIUS KIDS SHOW

321
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,336
Why aren't you sending him out, Eun-pyo?

322
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,631
Everyone else is dying
to get on that show.

323
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,552
I'm just not into getting
famous like that.

324
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,803
Jeez.

325
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,640
You should just go out there on TV

326
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:44,019
and put all those other moms
right in their place, you know?

327
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,105
That way Yu-bin's mom
will never bother us again.

328
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,316
Her daughter got rejected
but our kids got in.

329
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,901
She has no reason
to hold her head that high.

330
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,362
Forget it.

331
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,366
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

332
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,994
-Rock, rock, paper!
-Paper!

333
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,996
Why are you losing on purpose?

334
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,373
I'm not losing on purpose.

335
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,169
You keep putting out your hand late.

336
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,589
-You don't want to play, do you?
-I do.

337
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,716
Let's stop playing.

338
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,551
Why?

339
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,303
Then let's play something else.

340
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,055
No.

341
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,442
Here, have this.

342
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,079
-Class Three.
-Yes.

343
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,791
-Is this the one you're talking about?
-Yes.

344
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,543
-Jung Dong-seok.
-Yes, it's him.

345
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,380
His name's Jung Dong-seok, right?

346
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,006
-Are you sure?
-Yes, it's him.

347
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,466
-Really?
-Jung Dong-seok.

348
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,262
I was wondering what to do about it,

349
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,973
but since it involves Yu-bin,

350
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,559
I figured you should know.

351
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,153
-Goodness.
-Chun-hui, are you okay?

352
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,032
What do we do?

353
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,288
CCI ACADEMY FOR GIFTED STUDENTS

354
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,707
Mom?

355
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,419
Mom.

356
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,550
Yu-bin, it's okay. You can tell me.

357
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,594
There's nothing to hide.
You can tell me everything.

358
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,863
I was so scared.

359
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,700
I was too scared
to tell you anything, Mom.

360
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,580
It's okay.

361
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,416
It's okay, Yu-bin.

362
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,840
Yu-bin.

363
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,553
Where were you

364
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,182
when Dong-seok did that to you?

365
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,143
Here.

366
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,062
Here?

367
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,647
Yes.

368
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,740
Were you alone?

369
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,159
No.

370
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,119
Then who else?

371
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,539
Su-in was there too.

372
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,558
Hello.

373
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,186
I'm here to make a payment.

374
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,562
What's the student's name?

375
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,356
-Jung Dong-seok.
-One moment, please.

376
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,567
Is getting students
into good schools all that matters?

377
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,947
How could something like this happen
in a place with teachers around?

378
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,367
I'm sorry, but this is also
the first time I'm hearing about this.

379
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,662
Even if it's your first time,
this is still a serious problem.

380
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,748
It would be even more of a problem
if you tried to suppress it.

381
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,585
First, you drop a fully competent student
from passing the Geoseong Univesity test.

382
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,839
And now it seems like you didn't even
take care of your students.

383
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:44,509
Ma'am, I assure you we'll do everything
to handle this situation, so please--

384
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,386
What exactly are you going to do?

385
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,848
Kick him out now.

386
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,809
I don't want to hear any excuses.

387
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,896
Switching their classes
is not going to be enough,

388
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,399
so kick him out
of the academy immediately.

389
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,943
But…

390
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,903
Ma'am.

391
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:04,863
Excuse me. Ma'am!

392
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,576
Excuse me, ma'am.

393
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,328
Ma'am.

394
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,915
I'm going to look into it again.

395
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,587
So please just hear me out.

396
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,225
Hello, ma'am.

397
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,604
Hello.

398
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,398
Today was the first class
at the school for gifted students.

399
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,067
Oh, is that so?

400
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,362
Dong-seok seemed to enjoy himself

401
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,656
and the class seemed to
cover a lot of material.

402
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,783
Right. I see.

403
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,119
All right. Have a nice day.

404
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,391
Eat slowly.

405
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,351
Okay.

406
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,775
Hello?

407
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,026
Did you know?

408
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,948
Yu-bin and Su-in
were molested by Dong-seok.

409
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:30,865
What?

410
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,202
Molested?

411
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,414
You didn't know?

412
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,625
Tell me exactly what happened.

413
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:44,379
Dong-seok molested our girls!

414
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,300
Ask Su-in what happened.

415
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,843
What are you going to do?

416
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,346
About what?

417
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,139
Are you going to let it slide?

418
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,226
Are you still going to stand up for her
because she's a relative?

419
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,231
Where are you?

420
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,110
I'm at…

421
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,570
Think about what you're
going to do and call me back.

422
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,489
I'm not going to let it slide.

423
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,833
Su-in.

424
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,172
Did something happen to you
at school with Dong-seok?

425
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,765
Are you telling the truth?

426
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,695
Don't you know
how painful it is for the victim

427
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,905
to be in the same space
as the perpetrator?

428
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,534
We're the only ones
who can protect our kids.

429
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,077
So…

430
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,206
what are you planning on doing?

431
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,125
We have to kick them out!

432
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:09,088
We can't allow such impudent people
to live in our neighborhood.

433
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,216
I'm going to make sure they move out.

434
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,470
You have to be strong from now on, okay?

435
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:54,550
THIS IS YU-BIN'S MOM FROM CLASS THREE.
I HAVE TO CALL AN EMERGENCY MEETING.

436
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:22,745
MY CHILD WAS MOLESTED
BY ANOTHER CHILD FROM THE SAME CLASS

437
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,544
Dong-seok, come here
and put your socks on.

438
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,840
Dong-seok!

439
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,018
Dong-seok, you should be able to put
your socks on by yourself now.

440
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,811
We have to go to soccer practice.

441
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,063
I just want to finish this.

442
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,106
Jeez.

443
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,024
JANG-RYEOL THE BUILDER

444
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,319
How much longer does mommy
have to help you dress up?

445
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,820
Until second grade.

446
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,822
Do you promise?

447
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,075
All right, now this side.

448
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,788
All done.

449
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,668
Boys, have one of these
before we head out.

450
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,837
Let's see.

451
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,091
You have to eat this
if you want to use your energy.

452
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,262
This one is for Dong-seok.

453
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,764
And this one is for Dong-ju.

454
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,686
I beat everyone else and got first place!

455
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,604
Really?

456
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,190
-Yes.
-I'm good too.

457
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,776
Dong-ju and Dong-seok,
you boys are both great.

458
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,237
The coach said I was really good too.

459
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,238
Really?

460
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,448
Me too!

461
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,300
Yun-ju.

462
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,261
What's going on?

463
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,807
Coach?

464
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,518
Could we bother you for a moment?

465
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,354
-Hello.
-Hello.

466
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,024
Dong-seok, how about
I give you a private lesson?

467
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,651
-Okay.
-All right, let's go.

468
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,694
Okay.

469
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,744
What's going on?

470
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,248
Where are all the kids?

471
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,167
We're going to…

472
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,755
talk about something that
the kids shouldn't have to hear.

473
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,090
So I told them not to come.

474
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,885
What are we going to talk about?

475
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,430
Dong-seok hasn't told you anything?

476
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:34,437
Dong-seok took Yu-bin and Su-in…

477
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,857
I don't even dare to say it.

478
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,527
Dong-seok took Yu-bin and Su-in

479
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,822
to an empty classroom and forced them…

480
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,201
to look at something
he shouldn't have shown them.

481
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,040
What do you mean?

482
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,626
-There's no way.
-There's more to it.

483
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,922
He threatened to hurt them
if they told anybody else.

484
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:06,010
How have you been raising your children
that they'd do something like that?

485
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,554
I'm afraid of sending
my kids to school now.

486
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,975
I don't want to spend
any more time talking about this.

487
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:17,104
But what I want is for your family
to leave this community entirely.

488
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,232
Don't bother apologizing.
I just can't stand the sight of you.

489
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,407
This is…

490
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,994
This is the first time
I'm hearing any of this.

491
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,080
There's no way Dong-seok--

492
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,416
How are you not showing
the slightest bit of remorse?

493
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,920
All the moms who have daughters
are in an uproar right now

494
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,838
to have Dong-seok transfer schools.

495
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,383
Goodness.

496
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,679
Yun-ju.

497
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,515
Is this really true?

498
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,519
Did Su-in really say Dong-seok did that?

499
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,604
Yes.

500
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,149
Dong-seok's mom!

501
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,155
I get it.

502
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,953
As a parent myself, I understand
that it may be hard to believe.

503
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:17,623
But if your child has done
something this serious,

504
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:22,503
the first thing you need to do is get on
your knees and beg for forgiveness.

505
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,973
If that's what really happened…

506
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,434
I'm incredibly sorry…

507
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,605
But…

508
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,444
I'll need to hear
the full story from my kid first.

509
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,945
"If that's what really happened"?

510
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,907
"If that's what really happened"?

511
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,457
You're going to drive me mad.

512
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,964
Was having an affair

513
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,092
and killing your friend not enough?

514
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,719
What now?

515
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,806
Are you going to act like
your child is faultless?

516
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,600
You know what?

517
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:22,521
I could legally sue your kid
and have him live with a record forever.

518
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,524
But I decided not to take it that far

519
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,693
considering our old days, but what?

520
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,987
I never had an affair.

521
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,823
-Why do you keep framing me?
-Do me a favor.

522
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,660
Please…

523
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,038
Please just…

524
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,958
leave quietly.

525
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,922
This is the last thing
I can do for you, okay?

526
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,886
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

527
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,889
How shameless.

528
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,321
Dong-seok.

529
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:18,327
No matter what you did,

530
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,957
Mommy is always on your side.
You know that, right?

531
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:29,421
So no matter how embarrassed you might be
or how much you want to hide it,

532
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,050
you have to be honest
and tell me everything.

533
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:38,013
That's how I can protect you
until the very end, okay?

534
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,111
I really didn't do anything like that.

535
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,737
I didn't do that!

536
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,365
Then how come two people saw it happen?

537
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,618
Su-in and Yu-bin both said you did it!

538
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,788
They're both lying!

539
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,583
They plotted all this and they're lying!

540
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,167
You're mean!

541
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,336
You're worse than everyone else!

542
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,714
-Dong-seok, calm down.
-You don't believe me!

543
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,717
You're worse than everyone else!
You don't believe me!

544
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,968
Gosh, Dong-seok!

545
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,928
Stop it. He said he didn't do it.

546
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,763
Get out. I'm trying to discipline him!

547
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,224
Believing your child at times like this
is what a parent should do.

548
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,728
You don't have to be
the one to make him feel ashamed.

549
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,647
What if that messes him up?
What if they're telling the truth?

550
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,108
What are you going to do then?

551
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,777
What I'm saying is
we should hear him out first.

552
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,739
How are you any different
from those women right now?

553
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,034
You should be out there telling them
to stop spreading all that nonsense!

554
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,912
You need to figure out if you're just
taking your anger out on him

555
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,832
or if you're actually
trying to discipline him.

556
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,961
You could end up hurting him the most.

557
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,225
Why didn't you bring Su-in along?

558
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,313
Do you only care about your son?

559
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,691
She's already been traumatized.

560
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,360
Are you trying to
interrogate her or something?

561
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,365
But Yun-ju, Dong-seok said
he didn't do anything like that.

562
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,075
He said he really didn't.

563
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,371
You know Dong-seok is just a kid.

564
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,415
-Dong-seok…
-Eun-pyo.

565
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,044
Dong-seok is a gifted child.

566
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,881
Are you telling me someone
as smart as him is just a kid?

567
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,216
It's not like that.

568
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,719
He may be smart
in topics he's interested in,

569
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,889
but you know he's dull most of the time.

570
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:26,807
Goodness.

571
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,353
Please just stop.

572
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,610
The only reason I'm not doing
anything more is because we're relatives.

573
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,281
If you were a stranger,
I wouldn't let it slide like this.

574
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,994
-Let go of me! Seriously!
-Yun-ju.

575
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:38,712
Eun-pyo.

576
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,302
Should we move?

577
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,849
This neighborhood…

578
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,769
is strange.

579
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,607
Why don't we move
somewhere we feel comfortable…

580
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,445
so the kids can run around freely
like they used to?

581
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,991
We won't have to worry
about education either.

582
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,701
No.

583
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,329
Not like this.

584
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,416
We might end up moving out later on,

585
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,128
but we're going to clear
Dong-seok's name first.

586
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,465
I wouldn't care if it were me,

587
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,802
but I won't let this happen to my boy.

588
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,055
I don't care how messy things get.

589
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,808
I'm going to make sure that my boy

590
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,644
comes out of this unscathed.

591
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,241
Why don't you want to go?

592
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:50,742
Just because.

593
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,288
I have no friends there.

594
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,249
And Willy's not there either.

595
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,673
You can always make new friends
once you get there.

596
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:08,552
And if you want a dog,
you can ask your aunt to get one.

597
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,345
No.

598
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:19,021
Then how about I go to France
and check up on everything first?

599
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:31,116
Please take care of him
just until I get back from France.

600
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:34,620
I'll be back after I find a place to stay

601
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,121
and a school for Henry.

602
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,420
Did you tell Henry…

603
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,507
to tell me that he wants to stay here?

604
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,887
I'm also curious

605
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,431
as to why he wants to live here.

606
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:09,780
Why did you tell your dad
that you don't want to go to France?

607
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,916
Do you not want to live with me, Grandma?

608
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,751
Of course, I do.

609
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,963
I want to live with you
more than anyone else in the world.

610
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,800
But…

611
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:34,888
you know how much your dad loves you.

612
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,065
I want my dad to be happy,

613
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:49,569
but I also don't want my mom to be sad.

614
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:53,907
All right.

615
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,037
Let's do what you want to do, then.

616
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,418
All grandma wants

617
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,130
is for you to be happy.

618
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,844
Ms. Hwang.

619
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:18,014
Please reach out to them
and have a thorough talk.

620
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,809
I can't do so on my own

621
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:24,730
so there's no way
I can find out the truth.

622
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,314
Ms. Lee, the thing is…

623
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,652
Since this situation is rather serious

624
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:34,030
it might be best if I didn't go that far.

625
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,825
I'm sure this caused a lot of pain
for the mothers as well.

626
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,579
But Ms. Hwang.

627
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,167
Even though Dong-seok can be playful
from time to time,

628
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,795
he says it never happened
and finds this situation very unfair.

629
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,924
-Plus, so many things seem very odd and--
-But…

630
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,596
I'm not sure if I should say this.

631
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:02,976
Although it's important that
we believe what our children tell us,

632
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,147
sometimes it can be dangerous

633
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,274
to blindly believe everything they say.

634
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,068
Oh, jeez.

635
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,030
It's difficult.

636
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:19,659
Especially in a situation like this.

637
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,753
Try to relax your arm and slow down.

638
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,713
Very good.

639
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,302
Good. Relax your shoulder.

640
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,940
Good. Keep it up.

641
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,984
Gosh. Yu-bin is good, isn't she?

642
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,655
She's already improved so much.
You noticed too, right?

643
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,659
How has she been doing?

644
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,703
Does she have any sort
of trauma or anything yet?

645
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,039
I think she's okay.

646
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,711
Jeez, it's getting scarier
to raise a daughter, isn't it?

647
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,046
Yes.

648
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,758
Has that woman called you or anything?

649
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,388
She called but I didn't pick up.

650
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,391
Good.

651
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,977
Just cut her off completely.

652
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,605
-Gosh, you've lost weight.
-Thank you for coming.

653
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,274
-Get some rest.
-Make sure you eat.

654
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,317
-Bye.
-Bye.

655
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,829
You're right.

656
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:48,415
I think our plan was a really good one.

657
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,792
Do you think so too?

658
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,753
Yes, I feel the same way.

659
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,799
He'll probably get tired of it
and move out soon, right?

660
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:04,097
Kim Yu-bin, how are you so smart?

661
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,100
I know, right?

662
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,522
Yu-bin, that means you can take
back your number one spot, right?

663
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,066
I'm pretty sure
that's what's going to happen.

664
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,402
Congratulations, Yu-bin.

665
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,822
Now all we have to do
is get rid of Su-in, right?

666
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,574
You're right.

667
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,994
That's right.

668
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,916
But how can we get rid of her?

669
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,084
I'm not sure.

670
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,671
Don't you have any good ideas?

671
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,009
Kim Yu-bin.

672
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,060
What did you just say?

673
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,437
I didn't say anything.

674
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,778
What did you just say?

675
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,698
I'm asking you a question!

676
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,826
I'm sorry, Mom.

677
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,508
Mom.

678
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,265
Yu-bin.

679
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,018
Come over here.

680
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,111
Yu-bin.

681
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,699
You know…

682
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,995
that what you did was very bad, don't you?

683
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,204
I know.

684
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,419
What you did was horrible.

685
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,838
-Do you know that?
-Yes.

686
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,340
You won't do it ever again, will you?

687
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,134
I won't.

688
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,177
Okay.

689
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,723
My baby.

690
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,562
It's okay.
You're not going to do that ever again.

691
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:22,861
Yu-bin, this is what we're going to do.

692
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,573
We're not going to

693
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,701
tell anyone about this, okay?

694
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,327
Okay.

695
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,084
We really can't let
anyone else know about this.

696
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,005
Because…

697
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,091
Well…

698
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,763
If people find out about this,

699
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,894
then things could get really bad for you.

700
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,272
That's why.

701
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,276
Do you understand what Mommy is saying?

702
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,449
It's okay, don't cry.

703
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,744
Don't cry.

704
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,996
Mommy's sorry.

705
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,708
It's all my fault.

706
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,465
I just arrived.

707
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,011
Would you come this way?

708
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,137
Yes.

709
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,478
Ma'am.

710
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,939
Why would my son have to quit

711
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,524
when nothing has been proven yet?

712
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:45,443
I understand this can be upsetting.

713
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,698
But we get dozens of calls all day long

714
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:53,827
from mothers saying that they're going to
withdraw their children

715
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,080
from our academy
unless we take immediate action.

716
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,417
-Pizza.
-Tteokbokki.

717
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,963
I heard that Yu-bin and Su-in
from the top class

718
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,048
saw Dong-seok's underwear!

719
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,716
-What?
-Really?

720
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,302
And they say it was red!

721
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,430
-Really?
-What kind of boy wears red underwear?

722
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,557
I know, right?

723
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,644
Where did you hear that from?

724
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:26,693
Kim Yu-bin and Lee Su-in told everyone
that the underwear was red.

725
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,244
Is this you, Su-in?

726
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,787
Yes.

727
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,415
But why are you crying?

728
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,919
You're so much prettier
when you're smiling.

729
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:48,882
You have a wide range
of emotions, don't you?

730
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:50,842
Man-su.

731
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,220
I'll be home late after the class meeting,
so make sure Su-in goes to bed.

732
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,514
All right.

733
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,893
Su-in.

734
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,105
Do all your homework and reading
before going to bed, okay?

735
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,106
Okay.

736
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,941
Gosh, you're such a good girl.

737
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,322
Who is it?

738
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,619
What do you want?

739
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,247
I'm sorry Yun-ju,
but Su-in is home, right?

740
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,043
-Let me talk to her for a second.
-What do you think you're doing?

741
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:27,712
I just have one thing to ask Su-in.

742
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,881
What are you going to ask? Get out!

743
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,258
Hello, Man-su.

744
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,843
What do you think you're doing?

745
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:38,932
I just have one thing to ask Su-in.

746
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,433
I'm sorry, but please leave.

747
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,270
What do you think you're doing to her?
She's already terrified.

748
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,980
Don't you think this is too much?

749
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,107
I'm sorry. I'll ask from here then.

750
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,025
Su-in.

751
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:52,946
I'm really sorry

752
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,990
but there's something I need to ask you.

753
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,702
Do you remember

754
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:04,582
what color Dong-seok's underwear was?

755
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,421
Red.

756
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,508
Really?

757
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,972
Seriously, stop!

758
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,307
Are you trying to
traumatize her even more?

759
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,603
-She's lying.
-What do you mean she's lying?

760
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,063
Listen, Yun-ju.

761
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:30,358
Dong-seok is very particular
when it comes to colors.

762
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:33,236
So he only wears blue underwear.

763
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,530
She's saying they were red.

764
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,657
She could be mistaken!

765
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,159
Imagine how shocked she must have been!

766
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,203
It wasn't a mistake!

767
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,538
Seriously, stop it!

768
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,039
Stop doing this to my child.

769
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:46,916
I don't care if you're my cousin.

770
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,544
Do you want me to call the cops
and my lawyer right now?

771
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,630
Mom.

772
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,883
Don't do that to Aunt Eun-pyo.

773
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,012
Auntie.

774
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,347
I'm sorry.

775
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:07,061
I lied.

776
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:13,526
Yu-bin said that if I didn't lie with her,

777
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,823
she'd tell everyone

778
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:23,536
that my mom works at the supermarket.

779
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,540
That's why I did it.

780
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,507
Is that true?

781
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,593
Yes.

782
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,098
Su-in.

783
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,771
You're lying right now
because you're scared, right?

784
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:52,357
I'm sorry, Mom.

785
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,123
It's all because of you, Man-su.

786
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,714
This is all because of you!

787
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:24,847
You think this is what I've been
holding on for, for all these years?

788
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:31,562
If only you never nagged about
how expensive all those academy fees were,

789
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,607
I'd never have gone to work part-time.

790
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,528
Then I'd never have had to deal
with her damn nitpicking!

791
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,325
What's so great about her?

792
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,995
What makes her better than me?

793
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,164
It's all because of you!

794
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,999
It's all because of you, you bastard!

795
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:55,670
Why are you doing this? Yun-ju, stop it!

796
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,588
Stop it.

797
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:03,803
Yun-ju.

798
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,016
I'm sorry, Eun-pyo.

799
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:16,566
I'm so sorry, Eun-pyo.

800
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:17,650
I'm sorry.

801
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,361
Yun-ju, it's okay.

802
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,784
Let's go together, Yun-ju.

803
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:27,869
Hurry up.

804
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,961
-Hello?
-This place is right by your house.

805
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:40,214
-What's taking you so long?
-I'm on my way. Is Chun-hui there?

806
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,304
It's not a party
without our youngest member.

807
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:48,347
-Hurry up!
-There she goes again.

808
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,348
She's at it again.

809
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,851
We need our youngest with us.

810
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:53,728
Jeez, hurry up.

811
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,855
-Jeez.
-There she is.

812
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,857
We're just about done with our side food.

813
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:01,194
-What is she doing here?
-Why are they coming together?

814
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,029
Who invited her?

815
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,375
Can you move over, please?

816
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,672
Why are you asking me?
There are so many empty seats.

817
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:32,016
You really are a strange person.

818
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:32,934
Jeez.

819
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,937
Seriously, just strange.

820
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,068
What do you think you're doing?

821
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,737
You come here and order people to move?

822
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,113
You knew, didn't you?

823
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,073
Knew what?

824
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,658
That your daughter was lying.

825
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:53,538
What's this now?

826
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:57,917
Are you trying to spread nonsense
and turn my daughter into a liar?

827
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,961
You're the one who started the nonsense.

828
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:02,588
First, you try to frame me
for having an affair,

829
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,298
and now you're framing my son.

830
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,383
What?

831
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,426
Su-in confessed.

832
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,761
Yu-bin…

833
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:14,392
threatened Su-in to lie
about Dong-seok molesting them

834
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:18,354
unless she wanted everyone to find out
that her mom works at the supermarket.

835
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,064
Is Dong-seok's mom the victim then?

836
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,154
How did you raise her that
she goes around threatening her friends?

837
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,740
Did I steal something or commit fraud?

838
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,784
Did my being impoverished affect you?

839
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,620
My daughter is smarter than all your kids!

840
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,957
So why do you look down on me?

841
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:45,423
Tell Yu-bin…

842
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,759
to apologize to Dong-seok.

843
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,553
And…

844
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,431
I want everyone here tonight

845
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,017
to apologize to me.

846
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,687
I want you to apologize
for hunting down me and Dong-seok

847
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,732
without even knowing the true story.

848
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:07,028
And I want an apology
for the pain you caused my family.

849
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:08,362
I want you all…

850
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,157
to apologize for that.

851
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,164
But…

852
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:22,209
how do we know you two aren't in cahoots?

853
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,838
It doesn't take much to know
the true colors of someone.

854
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,884
You're the one who told
a downright lie first.

855
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,011
Everything about your husband

856
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:36,015
and Henry's mom turned out to be a lie.

857
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,562
You honestly wished…

858
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,065
Henry's mom would die, didn't you?

859
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,151
I saw you slap her in the face

860
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,111
with my own eyes.

861
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,659
And you told her that you hated

862
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:57,912
how she only acted like she cared for you
and worried about you--

863
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:00,373
Chun-hui!

864
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,460
What are you doing right now?

865
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:07,505
I warned you not to cross the line.

866
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,590
You've gone mad, haven't you?

867
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,637
This is who you really are.

868
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:18,140
The real you who wanted to be a professor
without knowing your true worth.

869
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,352
You acted so high
with your high education,

870
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:23,604
but it turns out you're no different.

871
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,065
You messed with something

872
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:29,402
you should never have.

873
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,114
I won't let this slide.

874
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,950
I'm going to stomp you into the ground.

875
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,119
I'm going to kill you!

876
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,329
Ask anyone what they would do.

877
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,498
Would they believe Yu-bin,
the model student,

878
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,000
or Dong-seok, the goofball?

879
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:29,211
You think you can win again
just because you won last time, don't you?

880
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,631
People in this neighborhood
only believe the top student

881
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,426
and not the worst student.

882
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:37,470
I shouldn't have moved into
this neighborhood.

883
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,890
I think my greed only made her feel small.

884
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:42,683
You can laugh at me.

885
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,061
Because I think my life is screwed.

886
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,564
You're the wife of that director
who came to visit all the time, right?

887
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,983
Do you think they had an affair?

888
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,735
You better brace yourself.

889
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:56,655
Because no one can come up
against me and my son.

890
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:01,285
