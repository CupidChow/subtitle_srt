1
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,150
Mr. Yan

2
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,000
Why you...

3
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,900
I come to confirm a thing with you

4
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,150
We didn't know each other before, right?

5
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,770
I look like your first boyfriend, right?

6
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,670
You refused me because of him, right?

7
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,150
Mr. Yan, as for this, we have...

8
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:01,770
Answer me

9
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,400
Yes

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,770
Then tell me

11
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,450
What's this?

12
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,550
Are you familiar with this scene?

13
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,720
You have remembered...

14
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,950
Does it matter?

15
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,020
Or what excuse are you thinking about?

16
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,120
The date on the photo is the same as the day I lose my memory

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,900
The ring on the photo

18
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,650
is exactly the same as the ring on my hand

19
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,500
Nie Xingchen

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,270
How long time are you going to pretend?

21
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,550
Yes

22
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,220
We were lovers

23
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,020
You admit it, finally

24
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,920
Then why did you lie to me?

25
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,870
It's been five years

26
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,400
It doesn’t make any sense

27
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,020
to investigate the past

28
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,720
Meaningless

29
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,520
Meaningless

30
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,450
You know that when I woke up in the hospital

31
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,900
there was only this ring on my hand,

32
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,570
I found the owner of this ring

33
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,170
for five years. Five years!

34
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,820
Now you tell me it's meaningless

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,600
I understand that you are difficult to accept it for a while

36
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,820
but we can't go back anymore

37
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,300
This is the reality we have to face

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,500
I'll call the driver to send you back

39
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,150
You watched me who don't remember anything

40
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,750
being played around by you

41
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,400
And finally, I fell in love with you again

42
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,870
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

43
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,600
Sorry

44
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,270
What you owe me is not a "sorry"

45
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,250
can pay off

46
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,220
I know it

47
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,250
On your stand

48
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,770
You don't think I should cover up

49
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,320
But for me

50
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,750
This is the best solution

51
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,470
The person who lose memory is me

52
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,970
You have no right to take away

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,320
the life I once had

54
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,620
Leave me alone

55
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,070
Let me go, Yan Jingzhi

56
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,850
Tell me

57
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,620
Where were you when I was comatose in the hospital

58
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,320
Where are you?

59
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,620
And where were you when I face amnesia alone

60
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,150
Where are you?

61
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,050
You said you used to love me

62
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,820
Why didn't you

63
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,600
come to see me?

64
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,270
Because we had broken up at that time

65
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,470
I rejected your proposal

66
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,250
I don't believe it

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,620
This's the fact

68
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,100
Then why do you never forget me

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,370
Everyone remembers their first love

70
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,000
But just remember

71
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,750
And besides,

72
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,250
you don't remember those anymore

73
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,000
Sir

74
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Any help?

75
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,720
Coffee, please

76
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,120
Two cups of coffee

77
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,270
Add some sugar

78
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,370
OK

79
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,170
Anything else?

80
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,520
I want to add your WeChat

81
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,050
Sorry, sir

82
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,700
Sugar could be added to coffee

83
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,200
but WeChat can't

84
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,700
It's right and proper that men wait for women

85
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,070
Don't worry. Miss Wu

86
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:06,650
Sis

87
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,870
Zhen Nian ordered a bottle of wine

88
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm her fan and I'll do it

89
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:09,620
Okay

90
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,020
Thank you

91
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,350
Sis

92
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,220
I'm your fan

93
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,600
Sorry. Miss Wu

94
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,050
I have some business need to do today

95
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,000
Let's make an appointment next time

96
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:33,920
Please enjoy it

97
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,000
Well done

98
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,570
Let me check

99
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,600
Nothing

100
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,400
Just make a business

101
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,320
Give it to me

102
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,600
Miss Zhen actually likes drown sorrow in alcohol at night

103
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,700
It's my place

104
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,050
Please leave there

105
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,320
What a coincidence

106
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,150
You're the spokesperson of our company

107
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,400
As your client

108
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,750
is this not irresponsible to me

109
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,600
in case you have any negative news

110
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,250
Have you loved someone for many years

111
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,700
Probably

112
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,970
Doe she love you?

113
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,320
Yeah

114
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,800
But not that kind of love

115
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,620
How tragic for both of us

116
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,670
We're different

117
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,850
Are you end with Yan Jingzhi?

118
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,100
End

119
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,200
I never have a chance to start

120
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,300
You're pitiful indeed

121
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,720
We're both pitiful

122
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,200
Slow down. Slow. Slow

123
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,750
Well. Did you drink?

124
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,100
Yeah. I did

125
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,570
It's still in

126
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,950
I did

127
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,520
Hello

128
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,400
I'm Nie Xingchen

129
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,800
There's something wrong with Mr. Yan today

130
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,450
and may not be able to participate in the activity

131
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,250
Sorry to trouble you

132
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:40,700
Hello

133
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,520
I'm Nie Xingchen

134
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,400
Hello

135
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,050
There's something with with Mr. Yan today

136
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,170
The meeting time with Mr. Chen might need to be changed

137
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,300
I’m so sorry

138
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,620
I'll inform you immediately

139
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,300
as long as I determine the time

140
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,550
Thank you

141
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,950
Miss Xingchen

142
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,070
These documents are all waiting for Mr. Yan to sign

143
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,150
Bojue brigade photography promotion plan needs to be implemented ASAP

144
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,620
What happened to Mr. Yan?

145
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,820
The issues raised by Mr. Yan last time have been improved

146
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,370
Please take it to the Publicity Department and carry out follow the plan

147
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,170
If there is anything wrong with Quwo

148
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:27,870
Please find Mr. Zhao

149
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,470
But Mr. Zhao is on a business trip

150
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,450
He isn’t in the office

151
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,300
Miss Xingchen

152
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
Is the regular meeting in the morning can be held as usual?

153
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,050
Cancel it

154
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:41,800
Go spread that information

155
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,600
OK. Secretary Nie

156
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,970
Everything else is easy to handle

157
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,670
the key is how to deal with the contract of Xishan land

158
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,570
It's almost over

159
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,720
Accountant

160
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,350
just wait for our boss's signature to make a payment

161
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,270
If we don’t make a payment today，

162
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,400
not only the land will be gone

163
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,070
we'll

164
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,400
also have to break the contract

165
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,100
If something goes wrong

166
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,900
We'd lose year-end award

167
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,800
Come on

168
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,150
Our company is facing such a big challenge

169
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,770
You still thinking about your year-end award

170
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,750
It's just our boss's handwriting, isn't it?

171
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,750
Miss Xingchen

172
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,800
You are amazing

173
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Guys. I’ll let you go

174
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,670
I'll explain to our boss

175
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,850
Well, let's go

176
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:00,950
Hey

177
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,550
You're not in the hotel of the crew

178
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:03,970
And didn’t answer the phone

179
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,070
Where are you?

180
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,020
I drank too much last night

181
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,770
Send me your address

182
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,550
Jinmao Luxury Collection Hotel

183
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,870
Why you are here?

184
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,620
What if you were photographed

185
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,900
Alright

186
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,950
I'll pick you up

187
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,200
Zhao Yuanfang, you villain

188
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:01,920
Don't worry

189
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,900
I'm not interested in women who are drunk like that

190
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,650
Taking photos is just a piece of evidence

191
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,950
To prevent you deny it

192
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,870
Disgusting!

193
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,270
Mr. Yan

194
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,150
Today is the deadline for payment of Xishan land

195
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,620
I signed your signature without your authorization

196
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,150
Colleagues're very worry about you

197
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,450
Guys

198
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,120
Shall we have a farewell party

199
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,700
for Secretary Nie tonight?

200
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,500
Brilliant! Good idea! Great!

201
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,400
Thank you guys

202
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,600
But, promise me

203
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,620
Everyone should be happy tonight

204
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,000
Miss Xingchen

205
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,270
You are leaving now

206
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,470
How can we happy

207
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,170
Yeah

208
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,420
If our boss is here

209
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,300
He'll send you with us definitely

210
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,500
Xingchen

211
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,220
According to your knowledge about our boss

212
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,120
Why would he disappear suddenly?

213
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,350
The reason why men quit their jobs

214
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,070
except games are women

215
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,370
I think our boss must be with Zhen Nian

216
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,950
Zhen Nian is just his gossip girlfriend

217
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,600
He never admitted

218
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,800
Didn't he?

219
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,050
My friends from starchaser group said

220
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,970
Zhen Nian has an announcement today

221
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,420
Too young

222
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,000
Young

223
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,520
Men

224
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,820
only hide themselves

225
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,720
when their career is frustrated

226
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,400
or emotionally hurt

227
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,820
Mr. Yan can't be the former

228
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,850
That must be trapped by love

229
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,820
Enough. Don't stand here all together

230
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,870
Just finish our work

231
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,220
We must be very happy tonight

232
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,370
Mainly to make Secretary Nie happy

233
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,500
Fire it up

234
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:11,370
Come on

235
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,150
Hurry. Hurry. Be happy

236
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,220
Ailu. Then I'll take it away

237
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,970
Go ahead

238
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,870
Come on everybody

239
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,750
I toast first

240
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,600
Wish Secretary Nie be unavailable soon

241
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,900
Invite us to eat wedding candy

242
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:39,650
Okay

243
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,020
Then I wish Xingchen wouldn't eat fat

244
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,000
The lottery will be won

245
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,120
The card won't burst.

246
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,950
I wish Xingchen can

247
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,000
find a boyfriend who is as handsome and rich as Mr. Yan

248
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,270
as soon as possible

249
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,500
Congratulations on getting rid of our boss's claws

250
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,670
and welcoming a free life

251
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,050
Miss Xingchen

252
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,270
As long as you need

253
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,550
I'll be available at anytime

254
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,300
Okay, sure

255
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,150
I have accepted all the blessings from you guys

256
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,900
I'll ask you to compensate me if they wouldn't come true

257
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,840
Come on

258
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,620
Cheers

259
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,470
I'd like to propose a toast

260
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,700
as Secretary Nie

261
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,370
Thank you for your help during this time

262
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,220
I hope we could keep in touch

263
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,870
Miss Xingchen

264
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,120
I accompany you

265
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:35,800
Come on

266
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,750
Hey. Look!

267
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,570
You made this atmosphere so heavy

268
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,570
I'm ashamed to say

269
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,970
that you've been taking care of all of us.

270
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,400
Now, you leave

271
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
we don't even know how to deal with the boss

272
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,420
Exactly

273
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,650
It might owing to I usually have more contact with Mr. Yan

274
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,620
I know him better

275
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,920
He has some habits

276
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,770
Such as... Wait! Wait

277
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,020
Hold on

278
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,270
Write down it. Write down

279
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,670
How precious it is! Yeah

280
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,150
Record it! Record

281
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,970
Any dirty things

282
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,620
will make him very uncomfortable

283
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,800
So you must remind him in advance

284
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,220
or just solve it

285
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,070
before he finds

286
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,370
He likes things in pairs

287
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,720
The volume of TV

288
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,550
The temperature of air conditioning

289
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,700
They're all need to be noticed

290
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,070
He only eats one brand of pineapple flavored candy

291
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,970
You must prepare it at his home and general office

292
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,820
He has many requirements for you

293
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,070
That's because the education he received from childhood

294
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,670
is to do his best

295
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,300
And he believes that we can also do better

296
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,900
Anyway

297
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,850
No matter who the next Chief Secretary is

298
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,100
I hope you guys could help him together

299
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,570
and help Mr. Yan as well

300
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,570
With you as an example

301
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,850
I dare not covet the position of Chief Secretary

302
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,750
Incisive!

303
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,770
Yeah

304
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,700
Our boss has a unique vision indeed

305
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,920
He found a treasure

306
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,870
Yeah, Xingchen

307
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,700
You're the Chief Secretary who suits for Mr. Yan best

308
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,420
Don't leave us, please

309
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,450
Miss Xingchen

310
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,170
We don't want to leave you

311
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,670
Yeah

312
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:08,950
Miss Xingchen

313
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,170
Is there a better company want you?

314
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,500
Do you?

315
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,500
Where are you going?

316
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,050
I just want to get some rest

317
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,700
And restart in another environment

318
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,450
Change an environment

319
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,020
Hello, Mr. Yan

320
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:30,650
Okay

321
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,550
I'll be there soon

322
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,420
What?

323
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,350
Any news about Mr. Yan?

324
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,500
Mr. Yan is in Jinghai Hospital now

325
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,520
And he may not go to work tomorrow

326
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,950
Jinghai. It must be kept secret

327
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,970
I'll at company tomorrow

328
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,400
I'd leave after the urgent work have been done

329
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,470
Bye guys

330
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,670
Miss Xingchen

331
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,850
I didn't drink

332
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,970
I'll drive you

333
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,070
Slow down

334
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,720
Tongxin really grows up

335
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,420
She didn't drink so she can drive now

336
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,120
But we didn't drink, either

337
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,050
Why not?

338
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,450
Our boss is still in hospital

339
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,750
Yeah

340
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,850
He won't come to company tomorrow

341
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,350
Waiter

342
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,300
Miss Xingchen

343
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,770
Go for yourself, Xingchen

344
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,870
Cause I have something else to do

345
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,750
Tong Xin

346
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,570
Please come tomorrow

347
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,120
to bring Mr. Yan some emergency documents

348
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,100
if he's not serious

349
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,700
No problem

350
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,100
Anytime

351
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,100
By the way

352
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,950
I actually have left office now

353
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:48,750
So

354
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,750
If Mr. Yan knows that I've been here,

355
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,650
he might be unhappy

356
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,170
Understand

357
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,470
I won't tell him. I promise

358
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,700
Doctor

359
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,620
What...What about him now?

360
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,820
Nie Xingchen

361
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,320
I'm a doctor who cure the brain

362
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,470
but not responsible for sobering up

363
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,470
Miss Nie

364
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,370
Memory loss won't be fatal

365
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,220
but alcohol will

366
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,320
A nurse told me that you're uncomfortable

367
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,750
Dr. Han

368
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,400
As soon as I can't see you,

369
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,870
my head is dizzy

370
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,050
and my eyes are blind

371
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,350
You should be

372
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,750
over dieting

373
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,450
You're hungry

374
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,370
But I think

375
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,200
my heart beats faster

376
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,150
Dr. Han?

377
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,770
I'm really uncomfortable. Leave him alone!

378
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,920
What should I do?

379
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,870
Let him go

380
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,220
Aunt

381
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,920
I've seen many people like you

382
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,320
People like you harass Dr. Han

383
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,650
in the name of liking him

384
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,820
Aunt

385
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,220
Who is your aunt?

386
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,950
I call you aunt

387
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Am I familiar with you?

388
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,000
Who're you

389
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,500
I

390
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,470
I'm the president of Dr. Han's Fan Club

391
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,450
What?

392
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,200
I'm the only female patient of Dr. Han

393
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,920
I am Dr. Han’s girlfriend

394
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,550
Your behavior just now

395
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,750
have caused great trouble and burden

396
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,600
to my boyfriend

397
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,550
I hope you could be more rational next time

398
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,800
Please stop doing things that interfere with social public order

399
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,020
and affect Dr. Han's work and life

400
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,500
Otherwise, I'll hold you accountable by law

401
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,800
Dr. Han. Let's go.

402
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,770
Dr. Han?

403
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,550
Thank you for what you did just now

404
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,950
So we have no need to take pictures today

405
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,170
Dr. Han?

406
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,920
High-quality single young men like you

407
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,770
not only have to face female harassment

408
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,470
also have to deal with blind dates arranged at home

409
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,870
Don't you think you need a girlfriend

410
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,870
to help you out

411
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,800
I don't need girlfriend

412
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,000
So what you need is me

413
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,720
Anyway, that aunt

414
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,650
has already thought that I'm your girlfriend

415
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:16,620
I suppose

416
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,550
that people all over the hospital would know it tomorrow

417
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,750
It would be better

418
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,020
to "sacrifice" myself

419
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,250
Temporarily be your shield

420
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,950
You don't really like that

421
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,670
Dr. Han

422
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,820
You've never been a fan

423
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,420
You don't know

424
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,600
how powerful fans can be

425
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,700
especially

426
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,020
when we want to protect our idols

427
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,550
I can probably understand

428
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,200
You can fan idol

429
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,300
but...

430
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,370
Why do you fan me as an ordinary doctor

431
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,750
You're not ordinary at all

432
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,350
You're the best doctor I've ever seen

433
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,370
I had a serious illness when I was a child

434
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,570
The doctors who treated me

435
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,870
were very, very tough

436
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,020
The speech was also very unpleasant

437
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,670
I was afraid to say

438
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,450
and afraid to cry

439
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,670
Anyway

440
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,420
it made a

441
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,820
great shadow on my little heart

442
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,870
But you are different

443
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,170
You are the light that scatters the shadows

444
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,500
That's my job

445
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,420
You didn't have to go out of your way to help

446
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,420
If

447
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
you don't want to be in my debt,

448
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,500
can you promise me one condition?

449
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,020
What condition?

450
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,820
Apply for two appointments a week

451
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,200
Then it's a deal

452
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,050
I'll leave first

453
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,800
Are you just gonna hold me like this?

454
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,820
Studies have shown that

455
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,420
Hugging for more than twenty seconds

456
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,820
will make someone love you more

457
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:34,870
And then

458
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,850
Taking to your dormitory

459
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:41,770
Angry?

460
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,320
Well,

461
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,800
when boyfriends take girlfriends back to the dormitory,

462
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,300
they will have kiss good bye

463
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,920
Why don't you kiss me?

464
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,600
What are you looking at me for?

465
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,850
Forget kissing if you don't want to

466
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,470
How do you feel?

467
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,700
Pineapple flavor!

468
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:22,900
Sweet?

469
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,850
What do you write?

470
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,400
So serious!

471
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,120
Your name is like a doctor's signature

472
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,270
Who can understand?

473
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:29,820
I teach you

474
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:31,950
Take it

475
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:34,500
Come on

476
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,470
Are you afraid that

477
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,920
I will steal your house?

478
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,100
Do you know how much I have

479
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,520
You just don't have

480
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,000
house, car, job

481
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,370
Graduates match

482
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,170
That's because I've just come back

483
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,670
I haven't got round to it yet

484
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,850
Okay, okay, I don't give up on you

485
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,250
Anyway, I still have six months to graduate

486
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,150
We'll get these two salaries by then

487
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
If we save RMB 100,000 Yuan a year,

488
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,420
we'll get a down payment in ten years

489
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,620
By that time,

490
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,270
pick a slightly off place

491
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,000
buy a house of eighty square meters

492
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,870
Although repay loan pressure is a bit big,

493
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,550
we are so

494
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,370
excellent and hard-working

495
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,070
We will get more and more money

496
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,720
Are you proposing to me in disguise?

497
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,250
No

498
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,670
I'm just taking you as an example

499
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,850
to map out my life

500
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,300
Your life plan sounds appealing

501
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,320
Hello

502
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,950
Can I join in?

503
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,120
Depend on your performance!

504
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,120
You proposed to me just now

505
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,920
I'm still watching your performance

506
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,370
Go

507
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,070
Drying clothes

508
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,720
Yes

509
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,970
Have you ever envied anyone?

510
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,700
No

511
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,050
When I was in college

512
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,170
I admired a girl in my class very much

513
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
She is popular,

514
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,120
do well in study

515
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,820
and beautiful

516
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,050
She came out with a leading role aura

517
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,620
but I'm not even a supporting role

518
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,770
Are you ready?

519
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,300
Come on, hurry up

520
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,750
Ok

521
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,720
Go away?

522
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,320
Alright, alright

523
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,470
Smile

524
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,650
Then I was in America

525
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,050
I saw Jingzhi again

526
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,700
It turns out he doesn't remember you at all

527
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,750
So I mimicked all your preferences

528
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,270
Success stayed with him

529
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,870
But I also discovered a funny fact

530
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,070
Ok, thank you

531
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,700
The only reason he helped me in the library was

532
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,620
because he couldn't stand it

533
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,900
when I put my books down

534
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,600
You terrify me

535
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,820
Sugar?

536
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,670
Give it to me

537
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,100
Okay

538
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,850
So the false is the false

539
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,320
Even after five years

540
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,470
I was the only woman with him

541
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,520
but never loved me

542
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,820
Do you love Jingzhi?

543
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,320
Yeah

544
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,300
Why leave him alone?

545
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,570
I have my reason

546
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,450
Since you chose to leave

547
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,850
why do you show up again

548
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,150
I will leave again

549
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,120
But not because of you

550
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,920
The problem is with Jingzhi and me

551
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,200
Congratulations, Dr. Han

552
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,600
Dr. Han has a girlfriend

553
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,170
Congratulations, Dr. Han

554
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,550
Congratulations, Dr. Han

555
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,770
No

556
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,270
I'm on a business trip,

557
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,300
not a promotion

558
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,620
For what?

559
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,820
Don't pretending!

560
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,320
For you' are unavailable now

561
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,450
Yesterday

562
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,250
We've all seen your little girlfriend

563
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,500
She's given us all candy

564
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,900
Specifically told us

565
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,450
to take good care of you

566
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,720
She's not my girlfriend

567
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,900
I know it

568
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,020
Fans?

569
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,000
It's funny that the young man has been in love

570
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,400
They have pet name

571
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,070
Dr. Han

572
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,820
Dr. Han

573
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,220
Well, I carried

574
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,250
I heard you are going on a business trip early this morning

575
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,950
I came by to drop you off

576
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,000
What's this?

577
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,020
The recording equipment

578
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,620
Huh...

579
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,200
Is it cute?

580
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,700
In order to make our cooperation smooth

581
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,250
and avoid unnecessary trouble

582
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
I specially recorded a self-introduction

583
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,770
Then, in the dead of night

584
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,770
or when you're on a plane or a bus

585
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,350
It will be your most intimate company

586
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,650
I'm sorry

587
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,920
I have to catch a plane

588
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,100
I'll leave first

589
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,950
Bon voyage

590
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,350
Don't forget the appointments twice a week

591
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,300
Jingzhi

592
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,120
How are you feeling?

593
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,550
Shall I call a doctor?

594
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,770
You took care of me last night?

595
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,820
Yeah

596
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,500
I came as soon as I got the message

597
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:43,650
I know it

598
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,450
You're still mad about the picture

599
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,170
I was afraid that after you saw it

600
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,120
I would lose my final qualification in your side

601
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,200
Jingzhi

602
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,900
Secretary Nie is the person you are looking for,

603
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,220
right?

604
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,350
Hello

605
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,250
Sorry to interrupt you!

606
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,800
Here are some urgent documents that need your approval

607
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,270
Just working

608
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,200
I won't disturb you

609
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,700
Take a good rest

610
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,620
Thank you

611
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,070
Where is Secretary Nie ?

612
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,320
We had a farewell party for Xingchen last night

613
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,200
She has left the company

614
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,270
Didn't she come to the hospital?

615
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,070
I actually have left office now

616
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,000
So

617
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,920
If Mr. Yan knows that I've been here,

618
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,050
he might be unhappy

619
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,550
No

620
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,020
Get me out of the hospital, please

621
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,100
I'm going to deal right now

622
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,050
Come here, please

623
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,970
Come on Director Huang

624
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,320
Payment for the Xishan land

625
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,570
Why is the payment delayed until the deadline

626
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,300
Mr. Yan

627
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,720
Bank loans take a little time

628
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,070
All related departments will deduct the semi-annual bonus

629
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,070
Reviewing in regular meeting next week

630
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,670
No job examination & approval yesterday?

631
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,950
Secretary Nie has handled yesterday's documents

632
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,400
for you

633
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,900
Why haven't I seen

634
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,350
today's schedule ?

635
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,950
Because Secretary Nie didn't know

636
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,500
you were going back to the company today

637
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,820
So...

638
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:00,600
Secretary Nie...!

639
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,350
You're not going to work without her, are you?

640
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,950
Reschedule!

641
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,850
The first day after Xingchen left

642
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,800
Miss her

643
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,250
Miss her

644
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,370
The boss turned black after being poisoned by alcohol

645
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,520
Turned black!

646
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,970
Bless the boss feel better

647
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,820
Feel better!

648
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,050
One secretary Nie left

649
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,990
and five Secretary Nie stood up

650
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,470
Stood up!

651
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,850
How does it feel weird?

652
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,120
Wait, Jingzhi

653
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,100
Thank you

654
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,300
I'm fine

655
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,970
Eating more, please

656
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,370
Sorry, Jingzhi

657
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,650
I just wanted to have dinner with you to celebrate your discharge

658
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,550
If it's not convenient for you,

659
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,950
I can get my celebrity agent

660
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,570
to delete the photos

661
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,270
It's ok

662
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,370
I don't care

663
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,750
Mingjue

664
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,610
Recriut

665
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:51,970
Hey

666
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,500
How to buy Weibo hot search?
