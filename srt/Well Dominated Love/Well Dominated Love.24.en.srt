1
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,000
Please be quiet

2
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,800
Everyone just look forward

3
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,690
This handsome man

4
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,410
is the groom

5
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,050
Mr. Yan Jingzhi

6
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,910
Your son looks so handsome

7
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,490
Let's look back

8
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,790
This beautiful lady

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,920
is the bride

10
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,380
Miss Nie Xingchen

11
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,380
Let's welcome the bride

12
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,100
Music

13
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,670
Xingchen

14
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,090
oh

15
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,260
According to the process

16
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,000
the next part

17
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,290
is for the groom and bride

18
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,960
to exchange the vows

19
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,860
and then

20
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,230
the rings

21
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,380
Hurry up

22
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,710
The rings

23
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,010
I love you. I love you

24
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,220
Good

25
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,550
to the process

26
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,820
the next part

27
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:07,610
Kiss

28
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,860
Good

29
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,090
Are you ready?

30
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,790
We are ready

31
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,750
Three

32
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,580
Two

33
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,350
One

34
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,330
Xinxin

35
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,430
Xinxin

36
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,420
It's so great

37
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,300
I'll find a good date for you

38
00:05:59,410 --> 00:05:59,790
Well

39
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,150
There is no need to rush

40
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,760
You need to know Xinxin's opinion

41
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,740
You silly boy

42
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,770
The one who gets the flower will be the next bride

43
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,470
No time to lose for you

44
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,270
You guys go

45
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,380
I'll leave first

46
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,100
Let's go, my wife

47
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,370
Why did you duck down just now?

48
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,070
No one will propose to me

49
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,100
So it's better for others to have it

50
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,610
It's not good

51
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,450
Everyone is here

52
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,920
The atmosphere is

53
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,220
good

54
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,240
So why don't we...

55
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,970
What's the matter with you?

56
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,020
You are insane

57
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,030
I swear

58
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,770
I'll not gonna marry again

59
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,790
It's exhausting

60
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,630
Who else do you wanna marry?

61
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,840
No one

62
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,780
You are the only one

63
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,670
Honey

64
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,540
I'm hungry

65
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,730
What did you call me?

66
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,040
Honey

67
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,900
You have a rest

68
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,950
I'll cook something for you

69
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,590
Darling

70
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,960
Baby

71
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,170
Dinner's ready

72
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,710
All right

73
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,900
But I have to take off the makeups

74
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,270
and take a shower

75
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,460
No, I'm too sleepy

76
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,410
Last night

77
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,660
I was too nervous to get any sleep

78
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,000
and woke up at 5 o'clock

79
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:00,840
How about this?

80
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,850
You sleep

81
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:02,660
and I'll help you to take off your makeups

82
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,780
Really?

83
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,330
Mrs. Yan

84
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,610
You've married to me

85
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,090
You can count on me

86
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,780
You go to sleep

87
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,580
How to take off makeups

88
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,140
Makeup remover

89
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,710
It doesn't work

90
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,620
Darling

91
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,980
How about we go to take a shower?

92
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:42,790
Come on

93
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,320
Let's go together

94
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:56,550
Ailu

95
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,550
Can you borrow your power bank to me?

96
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,730
Don't you have one yourself?

97
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,300
Mine's broken the other day

98
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,930
What's the brand of yours?

99
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,780
It's better than mine

100
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,940
Here you are

101
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,000
You can have it

102
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,800
Good morning, everyone

103
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,660
I'm back

104
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,370
Xingchen

105
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,200
Xingchen

106
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,210
Xingchen

107
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,810
How is your honeymoon?

108
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,580
Have you been to the popular honeymoon place?

109
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,410
Of course

110
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,660
We've met lots of newlyweds

111
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,880
Xingchen

112
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:38,920
You've changed

113
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,840
You are getting more gorgeous

114
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,460
than before

115
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,910
You are the one in love indeed

116
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,110
By the way

117
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,780
I've heard that the baby conceived during honeymoon is smart

118
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,230
Have you already...

119
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,410
What?

120
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,320
It can't happen so fast, OK?

121
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,870
I bring some gifts

122
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,700
for you

123
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:00,660
Gifts

124
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,630
Xinxin,

125
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,430
this is yours. Thanks

126
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,540
Where is mine?

127
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,020
Yours is the most

128
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,720
Wait, one more

129
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,880
I love you, Xingchen

130
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,560
This is a box of makeups

131
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,150
and

132
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,200
Dongxu

133
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,090
Thanks

134
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,300
This is your chocolate

135
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,510
Thank you, Xingchen

136
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,240
Here is our director Huang's health tea

137
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,600
Thank you, Madame

138
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:23,890
Well

139
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,230
Did you have a good time during the honeymoon?

140
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,620
Thanks to you,

141
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,150
we can spend time without thinking about work

142
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,300
Thank everyone for your hard work

143
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,620
That's what we should do

144
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,410
Not at all

145
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,990
Yes

146
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,850
There is one tiny little thing

147
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,610
to bother you with

148
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:39,980
What is it?

149
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,790
Could you back us up

150
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,440
later?

151
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,350
It' been half a month

152
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,820
Why hasn't the review

153
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,640
of joint venture project with Hengji begun?

154
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,010
Because there is a problem with the engineering visa

155
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,060
So it's late

156
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,450
How come you made such a stupid mistake?

157
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,040
I understand

158
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,070
PO has too many projects to deal with lately

159
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,440
How about this

160
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,240
I'll give you another week

161
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,630
You have to finish the review at the end of this month

162
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,180
Director Huang

163
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,040
Thank you for your hard work recently

164
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:23,900
Don't mention it

165
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,820
Not at all

166
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,090
Not at all

167
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,880
It's PO's duty to

168
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,730
share the burden for Mr. Yan

169
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:31,740
Thank you, boss

170
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,170
Thank you, Madame

171
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,230
I'll work hard as usual

172
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,600
Why are you looking at me?

173
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,030
It takes you this long to notice that I'm cute?

174
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,360
Did you replace my husband

175
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,630
when I didn't pay attention?

176
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:54,940
What do you mean?

177
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,490
Facing this kind of situation, you used to be like

178
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,780
What the use of having you here

179
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,750
if you can't even do this little thing

180
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,060
Get out

181
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,260
You should have acted like this

182
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,020
PO is on your side

183
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,500
If I yell at them

184
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,560
I may get punished by you

185
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,960
Mr. Yan really knows which way the wind blows

186
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,110
This is one of my advantages

187
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,420
Secretary Yan

188
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,420
have you got any other advantages?

189
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,480
Mrs. Nie should find them by yourself

190
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,770
I will

191
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:41,580
Mr. Yan

192
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,160
Secretary Nie

193
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,240
I've got something in my eye

194
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:46,850
Help me

195
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,240
No

196
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,060
I mean it

197
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,450
Why can't I see anything?

198
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,950
I need to get my document

199
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,370
Director Huang

200
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,380
According to the efficiency of PO,

201
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,720
the review can be done in 3 days, right?

202
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,810
3 days?

203
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,340
Yes

204
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,740
Then 3 days

205
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,790
After that, you have other tasks to finish

206
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,260
Mr. Yan

207
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,630
What do you say?

208
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,070
Director Huang

209
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,820
Is that alright?

210
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,390
Yes, no problem

211
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,910
He said no problem

212
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,750
OK

213
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,650
You may leave

214
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,210
Thank you, Madame

215
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,640
Mr. Yan, you stay

216
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,520
Mr. Yan

217
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,210
In office,

218
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,180
you'd better call me Secretary Nie

219
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,100
in case

220
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,890
we embarrassed ourselves like before

221
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,620
You are right, Secretary Nie

222
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,780
You are wise, Secretary Nie

223
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,440
You have a rest, Secretary Nie

224
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,640
I'm going to work

225
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,790
Director

226
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:58,840
Director

227
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,080
How is this?

228
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,500
Director

229
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,020
How's that?

230
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,950
Did boss yell at you?

231
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,640
What?

232
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,130
Did boss yell at you?

233
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,360
Like I said

234
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,520
Boss got married and

235
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,620
he surely gets more human

236
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,410
Director

237
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,000
How many time did he give you?

238
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,180
3 days

239
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,090
Yes

240
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,210
It should be a week

241
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,300
but just because...

242
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,830
Because PO

243
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,410
is always efficient

244
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,620
So

245
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,970
I turned Mr. Yan down without hesitation

246
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,730
I said, 3 days

247
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,510
Huang

248
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,410
Are you having a fever?

249
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,000
Fever?

250
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,380
I'm quite well now

251
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,110
I'm telling you

252
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,250
Listen

253
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,160
Let's work really hard for 3 days

254
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:53,880
Come on

255
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:54,570
Let's do this!

256
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,090
Fire it up!

257
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:57,790
Go! Go! Go!

258
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,420
Xingchen

259
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,780
It's terrible

260
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,270
It's terrible

261
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,880
Why married woman so energetic?

262
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,320
It hurts

263
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,000
It's even harder to see you

264
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,190
than meeting a famous star

265
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,740
You two are too much

266
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,060
Your honey is waiting for you to come home

267
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,310
We are not bored with each other

268
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,730
You stop that

269
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,370
I don't wanna share your love life off work

270
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,480
I may get a work sickness

271
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,130
Let's eat

272
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,270
Tell me what you need

273
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,370
I only get one hour for you

274
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,530
Do I need to wait in lines to see you next time?

275
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,220
Zhao Yuanfang

276
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,430
I'm married now

277
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,410
If I get home late,

278
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,640
I will be in trouble

279
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,810
Alright

280
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,920
Mistress, eat your food

281
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,410
Hurry, tell me

282
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,580
As a matter of fact

283
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,300
the thing is

284
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,040
that I have a friend

285
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,560
who

286
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,140
proposed to his girlfriend several times

287
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,200
but his girlfriend

288
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,790
kept saying no to him,

289
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,450
do you think what the girl's thinking?

290
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,030
Did Zhen Nian say no to your proposal?

291
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:41,500
No

292
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,950
I said it's my friend

293
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:43,790
Who?

294
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,540
A friend from nowhere

295
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,710
Fine

296
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,700
It's me

297
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,340
Come on

298
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,080
Just tell me

299
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,690
how you proposed

300
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,670
The first time

301
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,790
it happened on you and Yan's wedding

302
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,880
I saw your wedding

303
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,020
and I was so touched

304
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,640
I was dopamine high

305
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,680
and I asked her

306
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,950
And?

307
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,110
She said if I was insane

308
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,850
and turned me down decisively

309
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,840
The second time

310
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,570
Good night

311
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:46,910
There is too much rubbish

312
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,710
in your trunk

313
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,980
Clean it up quickly

314
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,550
Bye

315
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,590
No

316
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,200
The meat's over cooked

317
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,430
So

318
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,690
she turned me down again

319
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,310
So I think the reason why my proposals failed

320
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,710
is that she thinks I'm too dramatic

321
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,710
and not realistic

322
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,320
So I proposed for the third time

323
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,780
I'm going to the bathroom

324
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,470
I love you

325
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,440
is the pure and hard faith

326
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,860
I love you

327
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,840
and the strength from soul and life

328
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,850
Do you hear my call

329
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,160
from far away?

330
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,490
Love is my faith

331
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,220
to bring you to me

332
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,660
Miss Zhen Nian,

333
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,610
could you stand up?

334
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,670
Alright

335
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,430
In the movie

336
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,660
you starred, there is one line

337
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,150
which impressed me

338
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,760
Someone

339
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,000
is superficial

340
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,880
Someone just has flashy look

341
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,760
But one day, you'll meet someone

342
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,110
who is iridescent

343
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,730
and when you do

344
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,730
nothing will ever compare

345
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,010
I believe

346
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,670
I've met the one

347
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,980
Miss Zhen Nian,

348
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,770
Will you marry me?

349
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,280
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

350
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,270
I...

351
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:33,710
What happened next?

352
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,190
What did she say?

353
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,130
She said

354
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,750
Cut

355
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,130
Mr. Zhao,

356
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,130
are you going too far into the play?

357
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,990
Don't you know that in the following scene

358
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,100
the girl died after she said yes

359
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,420
Because her character

360
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,280
said yes to the hero

361
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,990
and died

362
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,140
What does she mean?

363
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,200
I think she just can't tell

364
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,960
if you were serious or not

365
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,510
Nie Xingchen

366
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,230
You know me well

367
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,020
How can I not be serious

368
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,630
after I proposed for three times?

369
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Zhao Yuanfang

370
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,200
I know you so well

371
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,930
Don't know the phrase which is

372
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,400
overdone is worse than undone

373
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,700
You are saying I've overdone it?

374
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,140
Of course

375
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,730
No one proposed so frequently

376
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,240
Your proposal seemed not sincere

377
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,880
And

378
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,180
Your relation is not long enough

379
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,280
You didn't give her enough sense of safety

380
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,010
Then you tell me

381
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,080
what should I do?

382
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,100
To be with her and wait

383
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,370
Don't act too hastily

384
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,820
Leave everything to time

385
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,260
So enlightening

386
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,030
I'm so enlightened

387
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,030
Why didn't I meet you earlier, Nie Xingchen

388
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,120
If so, I wouldn't have fallen in love

389
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,170
with someone else when I was six

390
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,040
Don't worry

391
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,710
I will take care

392
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:17,600
of the baby of you and Yan

393
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,350
I can take him to drink and hit on girls

394
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,170
You can't take him to do those things

395
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,960
It's OK

396
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,720
What happened?

397
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,520
I feel a bit strange on my stomach

398
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,800
I may have too much meat

399
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,130
You just don't

400
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,200
want to drink

401
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,770
Have some fruit

402
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,560
What time is it?

403
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,850
Why doesn't she come back?

404
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,930
You were pretending to sleep

405
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,690
How come you are back so late?

406
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,410
Do you how long I waited for you?

407
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,800
I want to eat some oranges

408
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,160
How did Zhao Yuanfang mistreat you?

409
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,080
He didn't buy you enough food

410
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,430
You wait for me to get even with him

411
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,750
You must

412
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,280
have passed your cold to me

413
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,170
My stomach felt funny in the middle of dinner

414
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,250
I felt a bit sick

415
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,390
I got over the cold several days before

416
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,910
Wait

417
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,520
You said you felt sick

418
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,060
No

419
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,780
No way

420
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,680
It's possible

421
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,830
Do we have home-pregnancy test?

422
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,390
I bought some

423
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,180
Well

424
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,530
How is this?

425
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,490
What dose two lines mean?

426
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,960
I'm pregnant

427
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:19,940
Thank you

428
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,200
Congratulations

429
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,240
Congratulations! Congratulations!

430
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,440
I'm gonna be a dad

431
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,530
What do we do now?

432
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,460
Let's go to hospital and find Han Ziyu

433
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,700
Right, find Han Ziyu

434
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,540
No, no

435
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,780
Han Ziyu is a brain surgeon

436
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,970
We should go to the gynecology department

437
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,110
to find an obstetrician

438
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,170
get the best ward

439
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,110
and the best doctor

440
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,790
Yes, yes

441
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:43,790
Darling

442
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,800
Why don't you leave with me?

443
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,120
It's too late, right?

444
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,210
We'll go the hospital then

445
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:50,950
We'll go tomorrow

446
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,110
What do we need to prepare?

447
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,140
Feeding bottle and diapers

448
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,930
I've got even number obsessive disorder

449
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,980
What if it's twins?

450
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,190
Darling

451
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,180
It's too late

452
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,440
You go to bed early

453
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,080
This way, please

454
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,410
Honey

455
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:05,780
What are you doing out here?

456
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,490
Come and sit

457
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,260
When did you buy these?

458
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,440
You know me

459
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,580
I always get well prepared ahead of time

460
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,940
Did I wake you up by talking on the phone?

461
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,880
No, I woke up naturally

462
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,220
Who did you call?

463
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:20,950
Your mom and dad

464
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:21,650
and my mom

465
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,450
Have you told them already?

466
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,380
My mom said she'd come home by plane

467
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,580
Don't worry

468
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,710
I've stopped her

469
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,670
You mom and dad

470
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,720
said they'd wait for more details until tomorrow

471
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,810
and see if you need them

472
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,780
to come here for you

473
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:42,570
Xingchen

474
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,550
Do you not want the baby?

475
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,020
How could you say that?

476
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,840
You said before

477
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,130
that you want to spend some time alone with me

478
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,510
I said that

479
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,570
But I didn't expect this then

480
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,600
Every baby is an angle

481
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,870
It picked us to be its parents

482
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,280
Whenever the baby wants to come,

483
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,950
we have to adjust our plan

484
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,070
to cooperate

485
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,040
Are you nervous?

486
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,500
A bit

487
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,470
Me too

488
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,850
When I was young, my dad always told

489
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,130
me to make plans for any matter

490
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,020
Otherwise,

491
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,620
you may lose control

492
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,700
and show your weakness

493
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,560
So no matter it's for work or life,

494
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,420
being accurate will offer me the sense of safety

495
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:38,840
But you

496
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,120
are a surprise

497
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,610
You are the only bug in the computer

498
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,660
called Yan Jingzhi

499
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,440
There comes one more little bug

500
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,990
How can I not be nervous?

501
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,650
And

502
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,220
I don't want to be the father as my dad,

503
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,520
but now

504
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,500
I don't know what I should do

505
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,060
This is the first time for you to be a dad

506
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,720
Lack of experience is normal

507
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,850
We can grow up with the baby

508
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,240
I believe

509
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,990
you're gonna be a good father

510
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,910
I will be

511
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,390
Congratulations

512
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,820
Your wife has been pregnant for 6 weeks

513
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,970
The embryo is in good condition

514
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,880
Have good rest back home

515
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:28,680
Thank you, doctor

516
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,220
What are you doing?

517
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,660
Send you home

518
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,310
You have a good rest today

519
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,000
No

520
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,660
I'm going to company

521
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,060
No

522
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:47,940
The doctor said

523
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,810
pregnant woman should rest

524
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,050
and can't work too hard

525
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,720
But the doctor also said

526
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,110
I should do proper exercise

527
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,600
and keep a cheerful mood

528
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,160
If I have to stay at home for 7 months

529
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,130
I'd be bored to death

530
00:31:59,230 --> 00:31:59,830
No

531
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,710
Go home and have a rest

532
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,050
No

533
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,800
Let's go

534
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,680
No

535
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,030
Go to work

536
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,220
or we'll be late

537
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,870
What's up, Sun Yang?

538
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,180
I got a cold

539
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:26,850
The report...

540
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,350
I'll deliver it

541
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,190
I'm on my way to Mr. Yan's office

542
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:29,810
I'm on it

543
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,010
Xingchen

544
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,660
Come on

545
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,420
You sit down

546
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,020
Don't move

547
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,320
Come on

548
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,500
Don't move

549
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,690
Xingchen

550
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:51,600
Come on

551
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,290
I'm on it

552
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,210
Don't burn yourself

553
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,290
I'm a grown-up

554
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,870
How can I burn myself so easily?

555
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,470
I mean

556
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,640
you should be careful

557
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,810
You see

558
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,160
I got myself burn

559
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,870
It's hot

560
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,230
Let me make this cool down for you

561
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,930
Did you tell everyone I'm pregnant?

562
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,540
Yes

563
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,160
I'll take over

564
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,110
all your work in PO

565
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,070
Didn't we agree on keeping it a secret for a while?

566
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,580
You're making everyone uneasy

567
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,430
Darling

568
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,700
I give you my support on work,

569
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,650
but you have to protect yourself

570
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,790
So we all make our compromises

571
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,720
and understand each other

572
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,190
OK

573
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,010
But that's it, no more drama

574
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,470
OK

575
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,800
I won't go too far

576
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,810
No surprise

577
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,330
Director Huang

578
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:00,830
Please come in

579
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,220
Mr. Yan

580
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,870
Publicity Department asked

581
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,250
about the plan of our company's entering into the market of baby products

582
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,390
Wait

583
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,970
Baby products?

584
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,560
What baby products?

585
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,560
I'm sorry, honey

586
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,060
I was wrong

587
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,280
You know me

588
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,160
I only trust the products made by our company

589
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,830
So the whole company

590
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,560
know I'm pregnant?

591
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,400
Yan Jingzhi

592
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,190
Come here

593
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,080
Move

594
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,560
Sorry

595
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,080
Yan Jingzhi

596
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,070
Come over here

597
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,580
How dare you

598
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,350
How dare you

599
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,090
I made a mistake

600
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,090
We agreed to keep it a secret

601
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,930
How dare you

602
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,170
I was wrong

603
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,180
Come here

604
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,500
Be careful

605
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,240
Where are you going?

606
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,830
Pregnant women are scary

607
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,660
Congratulations, Secretary Nie

608
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,420
Thanks

609
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
Congratulations, Secretary Nie

610
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,750
Thank you. Congratulations, Secretary Nie

611
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,550
Yan Jingzhi

612
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,050
I suddenly felt that

613
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,770
to share happiness with the whole world

614
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,340
feels good

615
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,460
I hope our Shanshan

616
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,920
could be the happiest child in the whole world

617
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,940
Shanshan?

618
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,940
Do you mean the words meaning twinkling?

619
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,360
No matter it's a girl or a boy

620
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,800
I hope our child

621
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,180
can twinkle

622
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,240
in his or her own sky

623
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,830
Let's go home

624
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,020
This is the Heshan Tourist Resort

625
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,690
developed by our company

626
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,150
The total planned area

627
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,590
is 112 square kilometers

628
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,800
The investment plan within five years...

629
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
That's all for today

630
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
Thank you

631
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,130
Miss Nie

632
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,170
Your speech today is quite excellent

633
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,280
I'm so flattered, Mr. Zhou

634
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,140
I assume that Miss Nie is quite familiar with the scenic area of Jinghai

635
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,740
I just came back home

636
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,600
May I have the honor

637
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,650
to invite Miss Nie to visit around the city?

638
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,730
No

639
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,010
If you wanna to look around Jinghai,

640
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,300
you can find a tourist guide

641
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,730
Shanshan. Do you need me to find one with you?

642
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:57,860
Who are you?

643
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,390
I'm the husband of Nie Xingchen

644
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,380
Yan Jingzhi

645
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,260
Who are you?

646
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,940
The president of Bojue

647
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,500
Are you Mr. Zhou?

648
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,860
If I'm not wrong,

649
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,440
your company suffered heavy losses last year

650
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,710
and is adjusting the business to reduce costs

651
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,240
Your boss would be happy to fire

652
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,370
some of his stuff who tarnish the image of the company

653
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:17,810
Sorry

654
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,980
I didn't know

655
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,370
Miss Nie is Mrs. Yan

656
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,690
Sorry

657
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,780
Shanshan?

658
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,540
What bring you two here?

659
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,020
We made plans with Zhao Yuanfang

660
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,030
I'm picking you up

661
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,180
What's more,

662
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,430
if we don't show up,

663
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,570
how can we protect you from the evils?

664
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,500
If you can't stop worrying,

665
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,700
just come back to work by yourself

666
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,620
It's enough for company to have you

667
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,200
Compared with the company,

668
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,540
Shanshan needs me more

669
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,750
You always get you way

670
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,110
All right

671
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:49,750
Let's go

672
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,310
Let's go!

673
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,360
Darling

674
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,520
I have something to tell you

675
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,680
What?

676
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,460
I've got even number obsessive disorder

677
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,630
Let's have one more baby

678
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,350
This is a work place

679
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,070
We can call the next one Liangliang

680
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,280
or Shanliangliang

681
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,760
Shanliangliang

682
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,490
Is it good, Shanshan?

683
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,680
Let's have Shanliangliang

684
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,070
OK

685
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,870
Let's do it tonight

686
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,130
Look at your dad

687
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,190
How were you doing with your work?

688
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,310
What were you thinking?

689
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,310
Tomorrow morning

690
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,300
before 10 o'clock,

691
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,390
send the report to me

692
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,900
Our partner needs it

693
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,950
Be quick or I'll be mad

694
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,360
Go ahead

695
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,220
You are good, Mr. Zhao

696
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,540
You're working harder and harder

697
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
It's your husband whom I should blame

698
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,170
He asked for one-year leave to take care of your baby

699
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,400
and got so obsessive with it

700
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,570
Did he have any mental problem

701
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,760
after he got married?

702
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,480
He kept posting pictures of the baby

703
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,640
and holding parties

704
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:48,750
What the party for?

705
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,970
Is he turning into a woman?

706
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,270
Watch your language

707
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,290
Mr. Yan did all of this for Shanshan

708
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:56,930
Yes

709
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:57,410
Xingchen

710
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,110
Do you hear me?

711
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,100
Sit over there

712
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:06,700
Honey

713
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:07,970
I'm thirsty

714
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,160
I want some water

715
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,360
OK

716
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,350
I don't want that

717
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,420
I want the water in my own bottle

718
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,150
It's over there

719
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:16,910
Hurry up

720
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,780
Go and get it

721
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,610
I loathe this kind of men

722
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,400
who get married and turn into a househusband

723
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,580
and have no independence

724
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,020
Hurry up

725
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,820
I wanna one

726
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,220
You can't have this as you are pregnant

727
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,170
Just one

728
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,420
Come here, Dr. Han

729
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:30,840
Shut up

730
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,080
Just one

731
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,740
It's OK to have just one

732
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,250
Yes

733
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,130
Xingchen is the one who loves me the most

734
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:37,830
Go have it

735
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,070
This is it

736
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,020
You don't know

737
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,810
ever since I have this baby

738
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,320
Baby

739
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,630
look at me

740
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,990
I've never had a bite of junk food

741
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,210
I want this so much

742
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,720
Dr. Han was doing something good for you

743
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,820
When is your due day?

744
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,300
One month later

745
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,610
I will take the load off finally

746
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,420
Look at Dr. Han

747
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,930
How efficient he is

748
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,840
Then look at you

749
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,930
How long are you going to put it off?

750
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,540
Yes

751
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,220
I don't know

752
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,060
It's not for me

753
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,080
to decide

754
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,900
You are the cutest, Shanshan

755
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,840
Come one, Jingzhi

756
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,730
Take a picture of us

757
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,950
Give me that

758
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,180
Come on

759
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,060
Shanshan, smile

760
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,610
One, two, three

761
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,710
One more

762
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,120
One, two, three

763
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:29,520
OK

764
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,850
You are killing me

765
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:31,360
Let me see

766
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:35,940
How lovely

767
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,500
Look at his little face

768
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,740
You can make one if you like

769
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,500
I'm telling you

770
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,970
after making one you're gonna want another

771
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,030
Am I right, Shanshan?

772
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:44,960
Jingzhi

773
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,780
You acted like an old woman who urges

774
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,870
every single person to get married and have a family

775
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
This called happiness

776
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,140
You have no clue

777
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,490
Am I right, Shanshan?

778
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,080
Are you sure you are gonna stay home being a super dad?

779
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,640
In one family,

780
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,420
everyone has to take one's responsibility

781
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,170
Instead of seeing Xingchen staying home with our baby,

782
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:03,200
I'd rather see her working confidently

783
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,270
and charmingly

784
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,960
Am I right, Shanshan?

785
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,790
How did you make sure

786
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,030
that Nie Xingchen is the one?

787
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,680
I didn't

788
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,160
only when you keep loving each other, then you'll know

789
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,110
Shanshan

790
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,460
Give me a smile

791
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,320
Food's ready

792
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,940
Come on

793
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,080
Let me hold you

794
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,350
Dad gets you. Let's eat

795
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,940
My son

796
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,730
Come on

797
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,230
Be careful

798
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,980
You stink

799
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,900
Look at us

800
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,990
Do we look like a family?

801
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,650
Where is your ring?

802
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,750
Ring?

803
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:52,580
What ring?

804
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,170
Are you a fool? Propose!

805
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,980
Ring?

806
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:00,940
My son

807
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,680
can you help your godfather?

808
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,130
You...

809
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:06,480
Zhen Nian

810
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,360
Will you marry me?

811
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,760
I'll give you my most precious things

812
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,300
You...

813
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,170
Just give it to me

814
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,270
Such a nuisance

815
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,300
Well...

816
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,850
I give you my yes

817
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,990
In this happy day,

818
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,820
this thrilling moment,

819
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,610
you two are my biggest support

820
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,840
Biggest support

821
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,820
Go and check if the vegetables are done

822
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,560
Take care of my son

823
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:37,550
Shanshan

824
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,020
Your godmother is getting married

825
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,630
Come here

826
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,330
Be careful

827
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,630
Come on and sit

828
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,410
Let's sit

829
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,390
How lovely

830
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,220
Are you hungry?

831
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,600
Dance for him

832
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,680
Shanshan

833
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,280
Look, godfather is dancing

834
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:56,990
It's a rare thing

835
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,050
You can have just this one

836
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,200
Thanks, honey

837
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,350
Mom is such a glutton

838
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,070
Jingzhi

839
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,350
Do you think

840
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:10,020
we will live happily like this forever

841
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:10,670
Yes

842
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,100
How do you know?

843
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,030
Because happiness is

844
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,440
to be with you every day

845
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,390
He's laughing

846
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,550
One more dance
