1
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,990
You are late

2
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,040
I had two operations overnight

3
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,490
It's already the limit of friendship

4
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,760
to come and eat with you

5
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,160
You have fifteen minutes for consultation

6
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,610
Nie Xingchen unexpectedly gave up the vested interest

7
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,160
for her first love

8
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,310
I used to think she is a smart woman

9
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,740
Now she is being so unwise

10
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,940
This question

11
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
can be answered by what they call

12
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,690
Zeignik effect in Psychology

13
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,990
People are more easily to forget

14
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,090
what they have got

15
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,810
but for those things

16
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,190
that are interrupted or unfinished

17
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,660
are always fresh in memory

18
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,910
So even if her relationship

19
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,310
was long over

20
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,890
but deep down her heart

21
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,590
she is still immersed in it

22
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,890
unable to get rid of it

23
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,660
But she needs to be realistic as well

24
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,340
You are seeing a diamond every day

25
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,360
Will you keep thinking of that stone?

26
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,840
In that case

27
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,840
the stone has an interesting soul

28
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,960
That means Nie Xingchen has a problem with her aesthetic

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,460
You are just like the fox who has no grapes

30
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,440
but says grapes are sour

31
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,160
I

32
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,360
Don't worry

33
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,440
It's just a common psychological defense mechanism

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,560
In order to solve their inner frustration

35
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,860
people turn out to explain the unachievable goals with reasons

36
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,540
to meet their personal needs

37
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,340
I didn't have a bite

38
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,910
Go get the check

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,640
You are being so realistic

40
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,610
I haven't even given you the right cure yet

41
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,440
What?

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,040
You got it

43
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,960
I need to eat grapes

44
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,860
Okay

45
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:52,840
Yan

46
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,090
Miss Xingchen

47
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,760
What?

48
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,560
The boss called me in the office himself

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,060
Have I done anything wrong?

50
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,190
Whatever

51
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,890
Go ahead

52
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,610
Mr. Yan

53
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,940
This is the project plan submitted by

54
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,560
the brand department on the Bojue Travel Photography

55
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,690
The initiative brand slogan is determined as

56
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,190
'you can shoot wherever you want '

57
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,990
Please take a look

58
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,110
Secretary Tong

59
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,960
Please learn more about this matter

60
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,410
you are responsible for it from now on

61
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,110
Such an important work

62
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,760
I will try my best

63
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,290
Anything else, Secretary Nie?

64
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,590
No

65
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,590
If so

66
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,010
you are free to go out

67
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,790
Our shopping mall

68
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,090
is built on the group's real estate

69
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,310
All families in the area

70
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,590
are our target customers

71
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,690
My request is

72
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,290
to meet the requirement of all classes of families in the area

73
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,540
Secretary Nie

74
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,710
Secretary Nie, oh, not here

75
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,740
Secretary Tong

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,460
Yes

77
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,590
Go and contact the consulting firm

78
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,610
to learn the life styles, features and needs

79
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,840
of all families in the area

80
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,990
Rearrange the layout and planning of business types

81
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,460
based on the information

82
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,960
Got it boss

83
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,040
You stood me up last time

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,340
but not this time

85
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,690
Xingchen, still working?

86
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,990
I am just waiting for Mr. Yan

87
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,540
I want to report something to him

88
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,690
Then you do not need to wait any more

89
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,940
He went on a date with Zhen Nian

90
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,660
By the way

91
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,640
I almost forgot to tell you

92
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,840
Mr Yan said there's no need to go his place this weekend

93
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,160
He has other plans

94
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,110
Okay

95
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,740
So do I

96
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,890
See you then

97
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,010
Bye

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,060
Bye

99
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:32,960
Have you had enough to eat?

100
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,690
I'll get the check

101
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,290
I need to go to the rest room

102
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,240
Okay

103
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:44,960
Hi, check

104
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,190
Sir

105
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,660
Have you ever been here?

106
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,060
Not really

107
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,490
Have you ever seen me before?

108
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,660
It's just you are quite familiar

109
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,290
But there's a large customer flow

110
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,690
I might have got the wrong person

111
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,060
Here's your card

112
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,090
Looking forward to your next visit, thank you

113
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,890
What are you staring?

114
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,210
Nothing

115
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,290
Let's go

116
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,190
Let's go

117
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,240
I heard from your mother that

118
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,460
you have never dated anyone before

119
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,960
Can you tell me why?

120
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,060
There's no need for dating

121
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,010
If you meet the right person

122
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,540
will you skip dating and get married directly?

123
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,590
Miss Jia

124
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,790
Actually , it's my mom who arranged the blind date

125
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,140
Personally, I have no intention to get married now

126
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,510
That's great!

127
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,960
Our concept of love and marriage

128
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,290
has come to a consensus

129
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,960
A little bit short in height

130
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,560
Plain in looking

131
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,090
and average in taste

132
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,140
She is not good enough for Dr. Han

133
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,310
There's one more thing I want to ask

134
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,090
Mr. Han, do you have any hidden secrets

135
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,490
about your relationship with women?

136
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,510
Now that Mr. Han does not like her

137
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,160
I'll take care of the it for him

138
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,210
Hi, it's you!

139
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,990
Here you are

140
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,790
I have been looking for you for long

141
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,660
Hurry and sit inside

142
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,990
Is she also with us?

143
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,260
We are going to pick up J tonight

144
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,260
What brings you here?

145
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,610
You

146
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,010
You know each other?

147
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,490
Here it is

148
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,590
He is the boss of our J support station

149
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,540
The station head

150
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,610
By the way

151
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,740
Here's the hat you asked for

152
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,610
It's already done

153
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,310
Take a look

154
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,410
and try it

155
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,110
You are a starchaser?

156
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,940
And a male star?

157
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,290
Try it on

158
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,090
Sir

159
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,240
Could you please let the other party know in advance

160
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
your personal orientation

161
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,140
to avoid wasting of time?

162
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,010
What's wrong with chasing male stars?

163
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,610
I am also chasing stars

164
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,860
Dr. Han?

165
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,090
Look here

166
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,610
What are you doing?

167
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,260
Dr. Han?

168
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,590
This hat

169
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,360
was handed to me in person

170
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,990
when J selected lucky fans

171
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,340
I must take a photo of it

172
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,890
as a memento of cross-dimensional integration with my idol

173
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,460
Anyway, thank you

174
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,810
You are so kind

175
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,860
You are welcome

176
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,960
As easy as pie

177
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,690
As the station head of your fan club

178
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,790
it's my duty to protect you from being harassed

179
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,890
I don't like to owe anyone anything

180
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,660
Now that you say so

181
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,960
Okay

182
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,360
Here, Dr. Han

183
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,560
Look at the camera

184
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,390
Tong Xin

185
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,310
Calm down

186
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,990
I'm really sorry

187
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,590
Like this

188
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,890
Tong Xin

189
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,540
Dr. Han?

190
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,160
Don't worry about your idol identity

191
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,940
This is a beauty cam

192
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,960
Then how about this?

193
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,690
Let's do the finger heart

194
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,910
Shall we?

195
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
Show me some cooperation

196
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,740
That will be okay

197
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,910
Look at the camera

198
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,960
Three, two, one

199
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,240
After leaving office

200
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,390
I will definitely adjust my circadian clock back to normal

201
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,410
Hey

202
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,410
I am Nie Xingchen, the one who reached you for house last time

203
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,540
I want to ask about the house of last time

204
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,510
Miss Nie

205
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,290
It has been sold already

206
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,460
Perhaps you can check other houses

207
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,540
Been sold?

208
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,310
Can you please contact me when there's suitable ones for me?

209
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,540
Okay

210
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,590
Mr. Yan

211
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,540
Where are you?

212
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,690
It's weekend

213
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,260
I have other plans

214
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,040
What can I do for you, Mr. Yan?

215
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,490
There's an important matter

216
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,940
needs your assistance

217
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,260
Is it convenient for you?

218
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,210
It's okay if not

219
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,490
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Yan

220
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,670
But I will do my job well before leaving

221
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,410
Okay

222
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,540
Ten o'clock

223
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,510
Meet me at the shopping mall

224
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,760
Ten?

225
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,990
I'm fifteen minutes earlier

226
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,560
It seems Han Ziyu, the fake expert

227
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,040
turns out to be quite good

228
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,460
Everyone is rebellious

229
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,910
If you can provoke her emotional changes,

230
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
she will do something that

231
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,940
she would never so

232
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,360
This is called the radical effect in psychology

233
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,690
Mr. Yan

234
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,090
You forgot your tea

235
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,210
This cup of tea

236
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,560
is it for me?

237
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,240
If Mr. Yan dissatisfied with me

238
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,560
please let me know frankly

239
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,410
You think too much

240
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,310
I have nothing unsatisfied

241
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,690
with your bob

242
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,660
You are leaving

243
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,340
I need to get used to the new secretary

244
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,290
Don't I?

245
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,540
You are right, Mr. Yan

246
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,540
Do you have any requirement for me today, Mr. Yan?

247
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,740
I need to you pick a gift for me

248
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,090
Is it for male or female?

249
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,740
Female

250
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,590
And her relation with you?

251
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,960
You've got so many questions today Secretary Nie

252
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,690
Surely it's for choosing a gift

253
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,210
which suits her

254
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,010
Precisely speaking,

255
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,660
we are more than friends

256
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,190
And her age please?

257
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,110
Close to your age

258
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,960
Any other questions?

259
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,240
Do you need me to tell you

260
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,340
where did we meet

261
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,560
and how long have we been knowing each other?

262
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,160
I was just wondering

263
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,890
maybe you can choose something like Jewelries

264
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,960
She doesn't like that kind of stuff

265
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,410
Okay

266
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,890
I know what to choose

267
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,060
Follow me, Mr. Yan

268
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,210
Sorry

269
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,360
I'm late

270
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,690
I'm used to it already

271
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,290
Long time no see, Yan

272
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,340
Take a seat, please

273
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,290
This is Secretary Nie

274
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,490
Hi Secretary Nie

275
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,290
I'm Hanna

276
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,590
Hi Miss Hanna

277
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,060
Here is a gift for you from Mr. Yan

278
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,040
So sweet

279
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,510
You still remember my birthday?

280
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,110
Of course

281
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,060
Open up

282
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,260
You finally remember not to send me jewelry anymore

283
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,940
I really like this gift

284
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,590
Thank you

285
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,360
Secretary Nie chose it for you

286
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,410
It seems that Secretary Nie has the same taste as we do

287
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,490
Come on

288
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,210
Let's order

289
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,590
What do you want to eat?

290
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,590
Okay, thanks

291
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,310
Suit yourself

292
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,090
Waiter,

293
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,810
How many are there in this dish?

294
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,910
Three

295
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,710
We will have two of this

296
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,490
Remember to put them into one plate

297
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,690
-Okay - I'm sorry

298
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,710
We've got a someone who like even numbers here

299
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,340
OK! No problem

300
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
And this

301
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,290
And this

302
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,560
and this Red Date Tea

303
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,060
One salad

304
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,810
Okay

305
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,160
That's it

306
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,010
Okay

307
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,960
Remember not to put coriander please

308
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,790
Okay, got it

309
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,860
Wait a minute

310
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,340
Sorry, I forgot Miss Nie

311
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,460
Is there any taboo with you?

312
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,040
I don't want coriander too

313
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,240
The rest are fine

314
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,560
That's more like it

315
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,910
Unlike somebody here

316
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,110
have obsessive-compulsive disorder and picky eating

317
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,310
Perhaps he will be alone forever

318
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,310
Then find someone just like you

319
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,940
who respect my lifestyle

320
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,190
You know Secretary Nie

321
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,810
Back to high school when we were in the US

322
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,690
We went to the summer camp together

323
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,290
But in the end

324
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,190
Because of picky eating and cleanliness

325
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,390
Yan does not eat wild food at all

326
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,440
He didn't eat for two days and got hypoglycemia

327
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,310
Yan collapsed in the river

328
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,290
If it wasn't for me to find him in time

329
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,210
there won't be him now

330
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,790
So you and Mr. Yan are high school classmates?

331
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,260
We are

332
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,960
friends since childhood

333
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,240
Hanna is the oldest friend

334
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,690
She knows me the best

335
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,360
Glad to hear it

336
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,140
By the way

337
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,210
What have you been up to lately?

338
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,660
Still charity?

339
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,640
Speak of charity

340
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,610
We are planning

341
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,240
a public welfare program for garbage classification

342
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,540
I don't know if Mr. Yan is willing to offer some help

343
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,410
for our environmental protection cause

344
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,540
Since you said so

345
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,740
Do i have the right to refuse?

346
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,710
Deal

347
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:13,990
Excuse me

348
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,490
I'd go to the bathroom

349
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,560
About the charity fund

350
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,340
I will just contact with Miss Nie

351
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,410
I don't need it anymore

352
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,960
You can just contact me

353
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,140
Secretary Nie is leaving the company soon

354
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,160
See you then

355
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,840
See you

356
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,790
Goodbye

357
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,760
How do you think of Hanna?

358
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,390
A pretty and excellent woman

359
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,590
Maybe the perfect candidate for my wife

360
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,690
Nie Xingchen

361
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,660
Previously, maybe out of

362
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,760
overdose of dopamine

363
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,110
I have made some unwise

364
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,140
actions towards you

365
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,010
Now I when I calm down

366
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,140
my partner

367
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,060
should be the one who knows me

368
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,540
We are not the right match

369
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,140
If you are referring to

370
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,090
Miss Hanna just now

371
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,310
As your General Secretary I must remind you that

372
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,960
she's already engaged

373
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,490
The woman Yan is looking for

374
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,340
is you Miss Nie

375
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,610
Me and Mr. Yan just met for less than a month

376
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,510
and I am only his General Secretary

377
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,960
Actually I forgot to introduce myself to you

378
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,040
I'm Yan's neighbor

379
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,140
And

380
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,110
I'm already engaged

381
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,610
I can tell that Yan is special to you

382
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,460
and I hope that

383
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,960
you can make him happy

384
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:26,810
Mr. Yan

385
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,560
The radical method does not work for me

386
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,760
Please do not waste more time on me

387
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,640
Nie Xingchen

388
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,360
Where am I worse than him?

389
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,790
You are perfect

390
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,340
But the one who I met first

391
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,410
is him

392
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,290
not you

393
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,310
I need to know Xingchen's first love

394
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,440
Why?

395
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,910
Because

396
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,040
I want to hit it off with her

397
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,560
Then I've got nothing to say to you

398
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,290
Besides, I am your rival

399
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,660
I'm impressed

400
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,340
You failed to be his boyfriend after being friends with her for five years

401
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,410
You have already lost the qualification to compete with me

402
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,510
Sure

403
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,810
Do you really want to know?

404
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,810
Dink!

405
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,110
If you win

406
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,390
I will let you

407
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,340
I like even numbers

408
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,540
Even

409
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,060
Get me three bottles more

410
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,690
Can you tell me now?

411
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,760
When was Mr. Yan so naive

412
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,010
to trust what I say

413
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,440
Not to mention that I already drink too much

414
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,190
and have no memory of it any more

415
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,060
You are mean

416
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,660
I don't want to talk to you any more

417
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,890
I will speak with her in person

418
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,590
Hello, Mr. Yan

419
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,890
Hey

420
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,190
Hi, is that Secretary Nie speaking?

421
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,940
Please come pick me up

422
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,710
Please send me your address

423
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,860
I will ask the driver to go and pick you up

424
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,060
You have failed

425
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,640
Why don't you give up?

426
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,010
Depend on me

427
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,810
Hey, what?!

428
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,560
Nie Xingchen

429
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,090
I was drunk

430
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,110
come and pick me up

431
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,910
You are not trying to trick me there

432
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,990
and resolve emotional disputes for you again, right?

433
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,090
I swear in my name

434
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,110
that

435
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,060
It's absolutely true

436
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,090
Send me your address

437
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,240
Same old place

438
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,560
I want to use the bathroom

439
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,910
Go on drinking

440
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,010
Don't go

441
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,110
Don't go

442
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,240
I am going too

443
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,760
Yuanfang

444
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:43,790
Yuanfang

445
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,290
Mr. Yan

446
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,440
Here you are

447
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:54,790
Xingchen

448
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,940
Please send both Mr. Zhao and me back

449
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,690
by my car

450
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,390
Mr. Yan, you can go back on you own

451
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,990
I cannot

452
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,610
Why don't you come and pick me up?

453
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,310
It's late

454
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,910
It's safer if the driver pick you up

455
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:24,610
You always have the best reason to refuse me

456
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,640
Xingchen

457
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,910
No more drinking

458
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,190
Go home

459
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,310
Hello

460
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,740
Can you do me a favor?

461
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,460
Okay

462
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,640
Thank you

463
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,290
No

464
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,340
Come on

465
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,740
Mr. Yan

466
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,790
Fasten the safety belt

467
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,560
We will send Zhao Yuanfang home first

468
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
We are

469
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,410
and then we go back together

470
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,360
Zhao Yuanfang, you have lied to me

471
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,810
This way. This way. This way

472
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:35,670
Sit down!

473
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,810
You lied to me

474
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,840
It is hot

475
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,340
It is hot

476
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,910
Why is it so hot?

477
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,690
Stay still

478
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,210
What a bad habit

479
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,710
to undress yourself when drunk

480
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,360
Secretary Nie

481
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,160
It's me

482
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,540
What is it?

483
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,360
I want Nie Xingchen

484
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,260
For my whole life

485
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,790
I have two things to regret

486
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,410
One is not be able to meet you earlier

487
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,560
the other is not to meet my father for the last time

488
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,860
Secretary Nie

489
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,340
Was it you who send me back?

490
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,490
Mr. Yan should have heard of the wolf story

491
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,310
If you keep doing this

492
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,890
Next time when there's really something wrong

493
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,490
I won't buy it

494
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,040
Hello, Mr. Yan

495
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,490
Secretary Nie

496
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,640
Help!

497
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,910
What's wrong? Mr. Yan

498
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,860
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment

499
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:06,960
Please redial later

500
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,240
Won't it really something wrong with him?

501
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,760
Mr. Yan

502
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,660
Mr. Yan

503
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,760
Mr. Yan

504
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,010
Yan Jingzhi

505
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,860
Mr. Yan

506
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,590
Mr. Yan

507
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,160
Yan Jingzhi, don't you scare me

508
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,760
Yan Jingzhi

509
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,090
Can you hear me?

510
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:48,940
Yan Jingzhi

511
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:14,990
Mr. Yan

512
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,860
It's cold on the ground

513
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:19,610
Stand up

514
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,860
It's cold indeed

515
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,410
Why did I faint?

516
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,790
Secretary Nie

517
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,960
Why am I home

518
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,560
Don't remember to have called me? Mr. Yan

519
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,190
Remember?

520
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,940
The hangover last night

521
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,940
has caused hypoglycemia

522
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,090
I have still got a headache now

523
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,840
Why is ketchup everywhere on the ground then?

524
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,960
The bottle was broken

525
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,010
so the ketchup spilt

526
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,040
I cannot imagine that Mr. Yan like

527
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,890
to drink ketchup in the kitchen

528
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,590
Why is your T-shirt unbuttoned?

529
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,160
Secretary Nie

530
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,410
Don’t you think that you owe me a new T-shirt?

531
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,440
Mr. Yan, your behavior is very childish, don’t you think so?

532
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,910
But it worked

533
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,590
Didn’t you say last night

534
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,190
that even if the wolf was here, you wouldn’t buy it?

535
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,760
Your are ten minutes earlier than before

536
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,790
Nie Xingchen

537
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,010
Clearly you care about me a lot

538
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,540
It’s just out of duty as a secretary to the boss

539
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,710
Why did you cannot wait to care for me?

540
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,860
Mr. Yan

541
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,560
I’m the last one you contacted

542
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,540
If anything has happened to you

543
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,890
I would be the first suspect

544
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,010
So whatever the reason was

545
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,290
I would come to your rescue as soon as possible

546
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,240
And

547
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,390
I will ask the accountant to cover the taxi fares

548
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,660
Because you asked me to come here

549
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,360
There’re other schedules today

550
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,960
I’m on leave today

551
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,490
I asked Secretary Nie to come here because

552
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:46,910
Nie Xingchen

553
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,560
If what happened last night made you uncomfortable

554
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,990
I apologize for it

555
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,710
Apology accepted

556
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,810
It's my personal business today. There is nothing to do with you.

557
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,740
What's your business?

558
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,410
Classmates gathering

559
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,540
No way

560
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,460
You

561
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,260
Nie Xingchen

562
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,160
What are you doing?

563
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,240
Put it down

564
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,910
I am telling you that I'd be angry

565
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,290
Nie Xingchen

566
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,090
Hello, everyone

567
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,240
Department Beauty is coming

568
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,090
Xingchen, you're the only one who misses every party

569
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,060
Go away

570
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,640
Leave this sit for Department Beauty

571
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,110
Come on

572
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,640
Take a sit, Xingchen

573
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,710
Hurry up. Sit down

574
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,990
Sorry for late

575
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,860
Actually, I'm busy with my work recently

576
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,540
By the way

577
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,640
I heared that Yuanda

578
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,790
was acquired by Bojue, didn't it?

579
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,960
Where do you work now?

580
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,390
I was transferred to the PO of Bojue

581
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,890
Xingchen

582
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,590
You are amazing

583
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,040
Bojue PO

584
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,640
I heard that's the most difficult department to join in Jinghai

585
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,260
You should write a career promotion guide right now

586
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,460
I promise I would be the first one to buy it

587
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,060
To write

588
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,740
how she climb higher through step on her old company?

589
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,640
Well

590
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,060
Not everyone can learn it

591
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,460
By the way

592
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,890
Some news said

593
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,860
that your boss are dating with that star Zhen Nian

594
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,190
They have relationship and they are couple

595
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,090
Is that true?

596
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,310
Mr. Yan is single currently

597
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,340
Single

598
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,560
However, I heard that

599
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,440
Yan Jingzhi and Zhen Nian have been in love for five years

600
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,890
You are such anxious to deny

601
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,610
Is that means you miss your first love?

602
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,910
By the way

603
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,040
Actually, you were promoted

604
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,860
because of the relationship with boss

605
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,860
when you were in Yuanda

606
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,790
And now you find that your former lover is more potential

607
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,990
You want to change it back

608
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,540
Zhou Weiwei

609
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
I'm really sorry

610
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,810
Sorry for disturb you guys

611
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,810
What are you doing here?

612
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,990
I come for pick you up

613
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,460
Sorry. Mates

614
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,260
We have to go now

615
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,160
Don't do that

616
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,790
Mr. Yan makes a rare coming

617
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,760
How could you just left like this?

618
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,610
Please sit down

619
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,140
Go away

620
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,640
Mr. Yan

621
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,910
Sit down please. Sit down

622
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,790
Mr. Yan

623
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,710
How to choose our Xingchen

624
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,940
as your assistant?

625
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,010
Secretary Nie left me a deep impression

626
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,060
when I saw her at the first time

627
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,160
So I hired her

628
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,610
from Yuanda to Bojue

629
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,440
Well. Mr. Yan

630
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,090
Are you fall in love

631
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,610
with our Xingchen again?

632
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,410
Exactly

633
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,090
Any problems?

634
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,840
Xingchen

635
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,760
Why you didn't tell us, Xingchen

636
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,360
Is Mr. Yan dating Zhen Nian...

637
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,090
You are...?

638
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,440
I were Xingchen's classmate before

639
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,240
Zhou Weiwei

640
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,610
Miss Zhou

641
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,210
I think you must be very happy in your own love life

642
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,740
Otherwise, how could you care about

643
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,160
other's emotional life so much

644
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,810
Mr. Yan. Mr. Yan

645
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,160
We are classmates

646
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,060
Please don't care about

647
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,090
her joke

648
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,490
Cheers

649
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,910
It's precious for you to stay true to the original yourself

650
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,090
after all these years

651
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,040
Stay true to the original self

652
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,160
Yeah

653
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,140
I hope that you could...

654
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,760
I can meet you at basketball court

655
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,710
Have I seen you before?

656
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,160
You get the wrong person

657
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:51,090
Secretary Nie

658
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,990
Nie Xingchen

659
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,760
What's his mean just now?

660
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:00,840
Nothing

661
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,860
You've no need to care about it

662
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,860
Then why are you anxious to take me away

663
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,760
I didn't get along well with him in college

664
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,190
I'm afraid he would spread rumors after he knows your identity

665
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,690
Why did he say he saw me before

666
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,940
He got the wrong person

667
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,560
Okay

668
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,110
Fine. I'll go back and ask him to recall his memory carefully

669
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,060
You should give a reason

670
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,940
why you don't want me to go there

671
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,610
Because you look alike

672
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,640
You look like my first love

673
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,840
That's why I treat you especially

674
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,790
Nie Xingchen. Do you take me as a fool?

675
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,840
I'm serious

676
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,990
Believe it or not

677
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:42,860
Okay

678
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,090
Give me his pictures

679
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,340
I'll check it myself

680
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,090
I've destroyed them completely

681
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,840
But I never forget him

682
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,090
You mean

683
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,760
There's another person in this world

684
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
who looks like me very much

685
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,340
and even life habits are same as well

686
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,590
I don't believe it as well

687
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,260
before I meet you

688
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,760
So I'm just a substitute

689
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,060
in your eyes

690
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,210
Nie Xingchen

691
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,790
For the first time in my life

692
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,740
someone treat me like this

693
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,190
Sorry

694
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:45,890
Hello. Niannian

695
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,760
Has media reported

696
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,260
that Yan Jingzhi is your boyfriend?

697
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,540
What?

698
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,210
Yan Jingzhi and Nie Xingchen came together

699
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,590
at classmates party today

700
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,760
I beg your pardon?

701
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,900
He also claimed to be Nie Xingchen's suitor

702
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,240
By the way

703
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,290
Someone says...

704
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,340
He saw Yan Jingzhi when he was in college

705
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,190
Do you remember Nie Xingchen's that boyfriend

706
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,210
Aren't they be the same person

707
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,290
You get the wrong person

708
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,210
Nie Xingchen also said that he got the wrong person

709
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,290
What is going on with you and Yan Jingzhi?

710
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,510
I have work to do

711
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,140
Bye

712
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,440
Yes

713
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,360
Hope to see you again at basketball court

714
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,890
Have I seen you before?

715
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,260
You get the wrong person

716
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,640
Sir

717
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,160
Have you ever been there?

718
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,540
Not really

719
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:24,840
Hello

720
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,740
It's you. Sir

721
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,110
I beg you to recall carefully

722
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,790
have we really met before

723
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
I'm really sorry

724
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,610
There're a lot of people in my shop

725
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,640
I can’t remember it for a while

726
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,290
Not recent days

727
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,360
Probably five years ago

728
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,510
Please recall it carefully

729
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,210
It's really important for me

730
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:43,810
Five years ago

731
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,410
I got it

732
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,010
Please follow me

733
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,140
In general

734
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,760
I'd help couples who come to our store take pictures

735
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,910
You might find your photos here

736
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,710
It should be a photo here, right?

737
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,110
Why it missing?

738
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:15,740
Hello

739
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:17,890
I need your help on something

740
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,110
Jingzhi

741
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,190
What are you doing here?

742
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,490
I'm here especially for you.

743
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,490
Why not notice me in advance?

744
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,840
I didn't clean up

745
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,190
Is there anything you want to tell me?

746
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,210
I planned

747
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,640
to surprise you

748
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,690
but you've caught me

749
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,290
My film will warp soon

750
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,090
You haven't came back to America for a long time

751
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,090
Let's go back together

752
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,410
Did you take away something

753
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,040
in the restaurant that day?

754
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,810
What are you talking about

755
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,090
I don't understand

756
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,310
You mean this photo

757
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,510
I think the composition of it is quite good

758
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:44,690
So I want to bring it back

759
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,490
and give it to my photographer

760
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,090
Zhen Nian

761
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,040
I've known you for five years

762
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,390
The habit of clasping hand when you are nervous

763
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,210
has not changed until now

764
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,060
Where's the photo?

765
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,190
That isn 't anything important

766
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:10,290
I forget it

767
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,360
This's the final time I ask you

768
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,860
Where's the photo?

769
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:59,490
Mr. Yan. When to find a girlfriend?

770
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,090
Right now

771
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:05,840
So that's why you are

772
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,790
so passionate towards me today

773
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,840
I’m not cold to you on other occasions, either

774
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,740
Aren't you afraid of her misunderstanding?

775
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:15,810
I'm afraid she won't misunderstand
