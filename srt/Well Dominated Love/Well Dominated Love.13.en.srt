1
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,930
Are you sure you don't need my help?

2
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:43,880
Yes, I’m quite sure!

3
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,530
Are you sure you really don't need my help?

4
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,480
If you help,

5
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,410
this dinner seems to be made insincerely

6
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,780
Alright!

7
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,010
Thank you, chef Yan

8
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:08,910
Okay

9
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,410
I'm waiting for your dinner

10
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,160
All right!

11
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
Let's have a drink together

12
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,830
If I hadn't just seen it with my own eyes,

13
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,860
I really have thought these were made by Michelin chef

14
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,830
You are flattering me!

15
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,930
With your favorite white peach flavor of Rio cocktail

16
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,030
Thank you!

17
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,410
Come on

18
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,410
The most fundamental part lies in its beautiful color

19
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,760
and the most important is the taste

20
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,710
Try it!

21
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,480
It’s so delicious!

22
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,330
Really?

23
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,160
You have one, too

24
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,380
Come on

25
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,210
How about it?

26
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,880
Not too bad!

27
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,630
Is this still “not too bad”?

28
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,210
Then all the rest are mine

29
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,530
You can just have more

30
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:11,960
This one

31
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,610
Have a “butterfly” of carrot

32
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,230
Did you cut this, too?

33
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,910
You are too good!

34
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,030
How did you make it so delicious

35
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,830
by following the steps of the recipe?

36
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,110
It’s my gift!

37
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,030
Thank you, chef Yan

38
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,730
I’m too full!

39
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,430
If you cook like this every day,

40
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,530
I’ll become a fatso within a month

41
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,160
So

42
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,380
would you like to give me a

43
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,330
chance to cook every day?

44
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,660
There's a big difference of going to work

45
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,580
between driving alone and with a company

46
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,860
You've been thinking this all day today

47
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,680
how to give me this key?

48
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,780
Not today

49
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,560
It was the same yesterday

50
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,880
But I have your password

51
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,960
It’s different

52
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,330
The password can be changed,

53
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,760
but the key will never expire

54
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,310
So

55
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,630
Would you like to hold it

56
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,630
to start our new life?

57
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,510
If my answer now is yes,

58
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,780
will it seem that I am not reserved?

59
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,260
You need to be like that when with others

60
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,360
but me

61
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,910
Never!

62
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,410
Lazy boy!

63
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,430
Get up!

64
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,160
Lazy boy!

65
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,580
Where did he go early in the morning?

66
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,660
Sorry!

67
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,580
The subscriber you dialed can not be connected for the moment,

68
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,510
please redial later. Sorry!

69
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,280
Let me check your positioning

70
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,880
What is he doing in the hospital early in the morning?

71
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,110
Has he remembered something?

72
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,280
Hail a taxi for me!

73
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,160
Yes, no problem!

74
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,010
Hurry up!

75
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,580
Okay

76
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,680
Come out! Come out! Come out!

77
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,280
Why did you get in there?

78
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,080
Come out

79
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,710
Hail a taxi! Hail a taxi!

80
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,360
Okay

81
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,610
Hurry up

82
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,030
Hurry up

83
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,330
You ignore me

84
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,210
Is it because I didn't say goodbye when I went out in the morning

85
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,630
and he was angry?

86
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,660
Lady,

87
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,130
please behave yourself!

88
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,260
He lost his memory again?

89
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,880
Let go!

90
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,830
Don't you know me?

91
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,780
Even if we know each other,

92
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,380
this is not the reason why you harass me

93
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,960
There’s a surveillance camera here

94
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,660
I can sue you for sexual harassment

95
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,460
Let go!

96
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,380
Lady

97
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,910
Are you going down or up?

98
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,460
Go up!

99
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,630
That’s impossible, impossible!

100
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,630
I must be dreaming

101
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,710
I'm dreaming, dreaming!

102
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,860
Mr. Yan, good morning

103
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,610
Mr. Yan, good morning

104
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:57,780
Morning!

105
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,110
What floor is my office on?

106
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,560
Your office is on the sixth floor

107
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,030
Thank you!

108
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,180
Mr. Yan, good morning

109
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,860
Mr. Yan

110
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:25,780
Morning!

111
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,610
Director Huang

112
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,760
Mr. Yan

113
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,810
The work related to Shanghai is over

114
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,310
Do you have other instructions?

115
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,880
I flew back on the earliest flight

116
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,780
Don't worry

117
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,680
Even if I was on a business trip,

118
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,580
I won't be late either

119
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,610
Come to the office with me

120
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,660
The office is tidy up well

121
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,830
Usually it is Secretary Nie who tidy the office,

122
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,810
But

123
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,110
I also provided a little bit

124
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,830
advice and necessary assistance

125
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,060
Director Huang

126
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,260
Give to me

127
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,880
all financial statements,

128
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,390
meeting minutes and weekly reports of the company

129
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,180
during this time since I was back

130
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,010
By the way,

131
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,410
take with research reports of all companies of Jinghai

132
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,760
and a list of all the employees of the company

133
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,430
Mr. Yan

134
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,310
Is something wrong?

135
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,730
I'm just going to make a double check

136
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,430
on all recent business decisions of the company

137
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,960
Only in this way can we find management problems

138
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,880
and make it for the next decision

139
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,480
I’m overthinking

140
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,930
You’re worthy of the most economical business elite

141
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,660
evaluated by Business Weekly

142
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:09,910
Mr. Yan

143
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,030
Your seriousness and rigor in your work

144
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,080
benefit me a lot

145
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,580
By the way,

146
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,660
the plan to acquire the shopping mall

147
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,530
has come out

148
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,280
Mr. Zhao wants to make an appointment with you

149
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
so as to report it to you

150
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,030
Acquisition of the mall? What's it?

151
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,580
That’s the mall you and Secretary Nie inspected

152
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,610
Have you forgotten?

153
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,130
I see

154
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,010
What other decisions I have made recently?

155
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,160
It’s a probing question, isn't it?

156
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,830
Not long after you returned home,

157
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,730
in order to open the Jinghai market quickly,

158
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,910
you started with full power

159
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,810
to wholly acquire all the shares of Yuanda Group

160
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,830
What?

161
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,330
The shares...

162
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,680
Why should I wholly acquire Yuanda Group?

163
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,510
Er...

164
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,360
I don't know that

165
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,980
You have to ask Secretary Nie

166
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,460
Secretary Nie?

167
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,480
Where is she?

168
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,430
Director Huang

169
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,280
You just said on the phone

170
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,480
that Mr. Yan asked me to his office

171
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,030
Let me tell you something,

172
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,180
Mr. Yan is in a bad mood today

173
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,580
As soon as he heard you were late,

174
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,910
he wore a furious face

175
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,710
He still knows you?

176
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,660
What are you talking about?

177
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,410
What do you mean?

178
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,110
I just went on a short-term business trip

179
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,530
How could he forget me?

180
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,910
You really…

181
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,610
Doesn't he have amnesia?

182
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,480
No! No! No!

183
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,760
Secretary Nie?

184
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,930
Do you know any inside information?

185
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,310
Am… Am I wrong?

186
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,460
No! No! Director Huang

187
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,010
I was just joking with you

188
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,880
Don't play such jokes in the future!

189
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,510
Let me tell you something

190
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,060
My blood pressure has come up

191
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,810
My heartbeat…

192
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,630
You just go over there

193
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,630
He’s waiting for you

194
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,480
Okay

195
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,260
Come on, come on!

196
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,560
You just bear in mind

197
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,460
Give me the bag!

198
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,180
I'll take it in for you

199
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,880
Come in

200
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,430
Secretary Nie?

201
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,110
Obviously, he knows me

202
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,430
He just played dumb

203
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,580
Is he role-playing with me?

204
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Mr. Yan, what can I do for you?

205
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,280
Since I returned,

206
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,160
you've always been my Chief Secretary?

207
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,360
Yeah

208
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,080
So you know the reason why

209
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,730
I made all the decisions

210
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,210
I dare not to say that I know about all of them

211
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,430
but ninety-nine percent

212
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,580
I hope your confidence

213
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,010
can be matched up with your ability

214
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,410
The first question is

215
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,310
why did I give up capital injection of Yuanda

216
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,680
and wholly purchase it instead?

217
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,660
Because I turned down your job offer

218
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,060
You mean

219
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,330
I wholly acquired Yuanda

220
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,530
because I tried to poach you?

221
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,210
As incredible as it sounds,

222
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,180
but I'm sorry

223
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,030
That's the truth!

224
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,430
The second question is

225
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,730
why would I acquire an UAV company?

226
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,480
As far as I'm concerned,

227
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,780
I think it was because you wanted to confess to me

228
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,160
Do you have any questions, Mr. Yan?

229
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,660
Then is the purchase of the mall also related to you?

230
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,780
That's because you were afraid of our secret relationship

231
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
would be made public among colleagues

232
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,080
and you found that temporary excuse

233
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,280
OK

234
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,310
I know you've done a lot

235
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,930
You don't have to let me repeat it

236
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,410
Director Huang

237
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,660
Take Secretary Nie out

238
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,830
Yan Jingzhi

239
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,680
It seems that it's not the first time

240
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,760
what happened in the hospital

241
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,180
I was going to let it go

242
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,560
But you have repeatedly

243
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,110
challenged my bottom line

244
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:50,810
I…

245
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,930
Don't use underground love as an excuse

246
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,610
I never get involved

247
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,560
with my working partners

248
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,780
You really have amnesia?

249
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,710
If you want to achieve some ulterior purpose

250
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,680
with my temporary memory loss,

251
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,230
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you

252
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,130
Yan Jingzhi

253
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,130
I'm really your girlfriend!

254
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,530
Then why are we hiding our relationship?

255
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,630
And how can you prove it?

256
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,360
Zhao Yuanfang

257
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,960
Zhao Yuanfang knows about our relationship

258
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,010
Zhao Yuanfang

259
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,110
As far as I know,

260
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,530
he was the boss of your former company

261
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,230
Will I believe what he said?

262
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:19,580
In addition,

263
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,930
You cannot tell anyone about my memory loss

264
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,880
This is a warning to you!

265
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,510
Mr. Yan

266
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,260
You asked me to...

267
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,310
Get her out of here

268
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,730
Secretary Nie

269
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,780
Secretary Nie

270
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,230
Secretary Nie

271
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
What's wrong?

272
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,860
Why is Mr. Yan so angry?

273
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,230
It’s because of work

274
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,280
I guessed right!

275
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
Think about Mr. Yan

276
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,080
He made all business decisions

277
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,060
But no reason was announced

278
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,530
How do we know?

279
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,180
I’m feeling too bad!

280
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,760
All right! All right!

281
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,230
Don't lose your temper either!

282
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,510
When he… Secretary Nie

283
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,180
Mr. Yan

284
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,930
Is there anything else I can do for you?

285
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,180
My chief secretary

286
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,680
should at least above that of an undergraduate

287
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,910
Can you explain

288
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:33,930
what means did you use

289
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,880
to get this post?

290
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,560
Mr. Yan

291
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,530
I can explain this for her

292
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,610
Although Secretary Nie’s education is not up to standard,

293
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,310
her ability

294
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,110
is obvious to all of us

295
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,760
These are two different things

296
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,810
Then how do you think to solve it?

297
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,230
I'll ask the HR to terminate the labor relationship with you

298
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,060
and pay you an extra two months' salary

299
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,160
Mr. Yan

300
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,830
I am a regular employee of the company

301
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,780
I've signed a formal labor contract

302
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,730
I don't violate any

303
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,810
of Article 39 of the Labor Law

304
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,260
And I'm healthy

305
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,310
and competent for the job

306
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,060
So

307
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,710
I'm sorry I can't accept your unilateral dismissal

308
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,360
Are you sure you want to stay?

309
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,330
I'm sure!

310
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,210
Director Huang

311
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,530
Then transfer her to the archives

312
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,760
How could this be?

313
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,830
I don't know

314
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,210
Secretary Nie

315
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,530
Why should you go against the leader?

316
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,080
Can't you just

317
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,380
admit your mistake and apologize?

318
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,330
After all, leadership is greater than God!

319
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,360
But leaders do wrong things sometimes

320
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,230
Anyway, this time I think sister Xingchen is right

321
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,810
What did you say?

322
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,010
I don't think it's a big deal

323
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,110
Mr. Yan is inseparable from sister Xingchen

324
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,980
When he’s not angry,

325
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,280
sister Xingchen will naturally resume her post

326
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,180
Ailu is right!

327
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,260
But...

328
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,310
Why is the boss suddenly so abnormal?

329
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,710
He's insane!

330
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,410
Maybe I know something

331
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,860
that I shouldn't know

332
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,880
Everybody takes care!

333
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,680
I'll go first

334
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,110
Sister Xingchen,

335
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,560
I just checked

336
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,870
the archives are full of people who are about to retire

337
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,880
No employee have been transferred in for five years

338
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,980
You are the first one

339
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,110
So if you're not used to it,

340
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,160
you can come back and see us at any time

341
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,480
Secretary Nie?

342
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,930
Sun is right

343
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,160
You remember that

344
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,330
our president office

345
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,560
is always your home

346
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,860
Come back and have some tea if you’re free

347
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,130
You just believe us

348
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,480
that we will definitely find a way to bring you back

349
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,580
Bye

350
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:14,480
I'm screwed!

351
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,610
I'm screwed! Oh, no!

352
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,010
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?

353
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,830
What's up, Director Huang?

354
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,630
Director Huang, calm down

355
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,030
Sister Xingchen should just leave temporarily

356
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,430
and she will come back again

357
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,230
Yeah!

358
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,580
I know

359
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,180
Why Secretary Nie was exiled?

360
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,210
Why? Why? Why?

361
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,430
Because…

362
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,460
You mean…

363
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,310
It must be like this

364
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,860
I wonder

365
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,430
why did

366
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,660
he send me on a business trip yesterday

367
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,910
The next target of boss

368
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,080
must be me

369
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:54,880
I'm screwed

370
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,030
I'm screwed! Oh, no!

371
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,180
Ailu

372
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,630
I have chest tightness and shortness of breath

373
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,210
Ailu

374
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,680
Check if my pulse is OK

375
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,060
Stop it! Huang

376
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,610
I might as well go to the archives

377
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,080
with Secretary Nie directly

378
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,360
Oh, my God!

379
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,180
Hello!

380
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,260
I'm a newly transferred employee

381
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,430
My name is Nie Xingchen

382
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,560
There's really a new employee!

383
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,780
Where is my work station?

384
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,760
Wherever you like

385
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,280
How to address you?

386
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,530
You can just call me Sister Chen

387
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,310
He is the supervisor here, Mr. Wu

388
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,080
Hello, sister Chen

389
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,510
Hello, supervisor Wu

390
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,980
Then I'll pack my things first

391
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,480
Miss Chen

392
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,910
I want to borrow a rag

393
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,710
The table is too dirty

394
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,110
Here it is!

395
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,460
It really is

396
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,460
It hasn’t been clean for a long time

397
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,580
Thank you! Sister Chen

398
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,510
Supervisor Wu

399
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,630
I want to ask

400
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,630
if there is any job for me?

401
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,230
You just suit yourself

402
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,780
How about I separate the important documents

403
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,480
from ordinary documents?

404
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,730
They will not be easily lost

405
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,110
when being compiled in the future

406
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,130
Now many data files

407
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,660
are all uploaded to the cloud platform directly

408
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,310
under digital management

409
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,210
These materials

410
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,610
were stored here long time ago

411
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,080
No one will come to look them up

412
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,910
Miss Nie

413
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,960
You made a mistake before you transferred, didn't you?

414
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,880
Our department

415
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,360
is for the elderly

416
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,430
If you’re transferred here,

417
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,960
it means there is no hope of promotion

418
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,430
If you still have a career ideal

419
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,430
I advise you to change jobs as soon as possible

420
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,980
Otherwise, like me

421
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,460
to enjoy your later years by

422
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,830
just planting flowers and drinking tea here

423
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,760
Enjoy my later years!

424
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,630
Have you found it yet?

425
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,060
Right now! Right now! Don't rush! Don't rush

426
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,530
Hurry up

427
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,430
My little Lord

428
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,630
The busier I am, the more you messed it up,

429
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,410
isn't it?

430
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,560
It's all over the floor

431
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,380
Sorry, Director

432
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,380
Director, sister Ailu

433
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,210
How do you think the boss could

434
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,280
take it out on us

435
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,660
because of his emotional life

436
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,710
Keep your voice down!

437
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,160
But

438
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,480
do you believe if sister Xingchen

439
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
was sent to the archives

440
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,710
because the boss failed to confess?

441
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,780
Why do I think something is wrong when I think it over?

442
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,710
Is the boss such a person who does not distinguish between work and private affairs?

443
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,880
Little Tongxin

444
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,560
You've been with me for so long

445
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,330
You've seen my wisdom for a while, haven't you?

446
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,910
Look

447
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,910
Yesterday morning

448
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,180
I caught Mr. Yan making a confession rehearsal

449
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,260
and was sent to Shanghai in the afternoon

450
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,660
A good man like Mr. Yan,

451
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,310
what can make his pride be hurt except being injected

452
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,730
Is there anything else that can change his temperament?

453
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,430
Think about it!

454
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,160
Am I right?

455
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,210
Director Huang. Mr. Yan

456
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,210
Mr. Yan

457
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,180
Have you sorted out the files?

458
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,730
Files?

459
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,480
Yes! Yes!

460
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,960
Just one?

461
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,630
What about the research reports of other companies?

462
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,060
Secretary Nie was responsible for this

463
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,010
Call her to take it back!

464
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,580
I’ve called her!

465
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:05,830
Secretary Nie said

466
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,380
it’s in her mind

467
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,010
I...I'll ask her again

468
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,010
I'll ask her again, okay?

469
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,430
The PO doesn’t

470
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,260
work without Nie Xingchen?

471
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,380
What do I have so many of you for?

472
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,580
I'll only give you one day

473
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,610
In addition,

474
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,930
give notice to the HR

475
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,080
to get me the Chief Secretary as quickly as possible

476
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,610
I have to meet her tomorrow

477
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,410
Yes

478
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,060
Mr. Yan

479
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,330
I have something to say to you

480
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,030
Mr. Yan

481
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,080
Mr. Yan

482
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,230
Yan Jingzhi

483
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,810
Can you listen to me?

484
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,250
Okay

485
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,200
Yan Jingzhi

486
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,810
You always lose your memory

487
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,810
You should go to the hospital to treat your brain

488
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,760
I’m responsible for curing brain

489
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,930
but for sobering up

490
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,260
The Jinghai Hospital!

491
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,580
Please come in

492
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,860
Hello, Dr. Han

493
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,560
Miss Nie

494
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,560
You still know me?

495
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,460
I am not only a doctor of Jingzhi,

496
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,760
but also his friend

497
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,980
Then you should know why I came to you

498
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,210
Sit down

499
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,230
I want to know

500
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,410
why does Jingzhi suddenly lose his memory again?

501
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,760
I had a brain examination for him this morning

502
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,260
The result was the same as before

503
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,860
Nothing was unusual about it

504
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,360
Then how could...

505
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,880
I know you were lovers once

506
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,980
His last memory loss

507
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,110
happened when I asked you to marry him

508
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,530
That's right

509
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,680
It was five years ago

510
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,010
Then I want to know

511
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:37,980
what happened to you

512
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,710
this time

513
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,130
It was that

514
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,710
we woke up in the morning...

515
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:45,910
So

516
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,180
Was it after you had an intimate relationship?

517
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,180
And it was the same as five years ago

518
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,110
The memory he lost

519
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,860
started from the day you showed up

520
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,310
So

521
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,730
I was the cause of his amnesia?

522
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,910
I can't be sure about this either

523
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,730
Some people have amnesia

524
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,030
psychologically

525
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,130
while others have it physically

526
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,580
For example, he is hit hard

527
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,710
and started the psychological defense mechanism

528
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,830
Thereby he lost a memory

529
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
Neither of these seems to be right

530
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,210
This is also the reason why I can't understand it

531
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,510
The human brain is actually like a computer

532
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,360
Why does the firewall of Jingzhi

533
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,910
choose to

534
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,660
delete the memory related to you?

535
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,560
Am I his bug?

536
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,130
Now, he can't remember

537
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,660
about our relationship

538
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,930
Is there any way to get him to accept me again?

539
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,360
Er...

540
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,030
Dr. Han

541
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,530
I think Jingzhi should believe you

542
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,110
Can you help me to prove that

543
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,610
I'm really his girlfriend?

544
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:10,780
Were there some misunderstandings

545
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,280
between you two?

546
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,880
Now he thinks I'm a liar

547
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,980
and deliberately seduce him for the superior position

548
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,530
There is a law in psychology

549
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,860
called premiere effect

550
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,930
It means that in the process of interpersonal communication,

551
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,310
the first impression always

552
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,930
determines how you will get along in the future

553
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,060
You have aroused the dislike of Jingzhi now

554
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,210
Even if I prove your relationship,

555
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,460
I think Jingzhi will also reject you

556
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,110
Then what should I do?

557
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,030
Since you can make him fall in love with you twice

558
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,530
Then maybe there will be a third time

559
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,180
But why should I do that?

560
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,710
Why should he forget when he wants to forget

561
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,210
and I have to remember all this by myself?

562
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,960
Why doesn't he remember me,

563
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,930
but he can still

564
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,960
be proud?

565
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,460
But you still love him,

566
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:19,960
right?

567
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,460
Hello, Tong Xin

568
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,410
What's up?

569
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,730
I put that document in the third drawer from top to bottom

570
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,310
in the filing cabinet

571
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,330
Yellow folder

572
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,330
and yellow label

573
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,410
Have you found it?

574
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:53,930
Okay

575
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,560
Then call me if you need anything

576
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,330
I think you're right

577
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,230
What?

578
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,610
Since he can fall in love with me twice,

579
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,580
there must be a third time

580
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,030
I'm not being his bug

581
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,480
I want to be a hacker

582
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,430
to capture the computer of Yan Jingzhi

583
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,960
I have already thought about it just now

584
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,280
With his critical degree of the chief secretary,

585
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,510
I'm sure I can get my job back soon

586
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,460
I will definitely have a chance then

587
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,260
Miss Nie

588
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,510
I support you

589
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,910
Thanks a lot!

590
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,430
Wait! Wait! Wait!

591
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,460
Thank you!

592
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,180
Dress same

593
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,080
Hello, everyone

594
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,860
Sister Xingchen, Xingchen

595
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,160
Sister Xingchen,

596
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,530
Sister Xingchen,

597
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,510
We were all tortured crazy by our boss

598
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,630
during your absence

599
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:42,960
Here it is!

600
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,760
These are the

601
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,610
research reports of major companies in Jinghai sorted by me

602
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,980
You can perfect the details again

603
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,010
There won't be much problem

604
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,060
Thank you, Xingchen!

605
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,230
Secretary Nie?

606
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,930
I have to bow to you

607
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,160
Director Huang

608
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,880
You are our great savior

609
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:58,960
How about like this?

610
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,530
I still have some dark tea in my home

611
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,730
I'll bring it to you tomorrow

612
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,460
No, thanks! Director Huang

613
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,360
You're welcome!

614
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,830
This is all I should do

615
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,910
And I don't usually drink tea

616
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,260
Don't spoil your good things

617
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,380
Look

618
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,380
Director Huang

619
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,630
I saw a fresh face in the elevator just now

620
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,910
She got off when she got to this floor

621
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,160
Is she a client of Mr. Yan?

622
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,710
That may be the one who interviewed the chief secretary

623
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,110
She should be Jin Beina

624
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,080
Is she highly educated?

625
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,330
Well, not bad

626
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,260
It seems that she is a graduate student major in

627
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,060
the human resources department of Cornell University

628
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,060
But don't worry

629
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,210
Mr. Yan

630
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,130
just met her once

631
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,910
He doesn't have to choose her yet

632
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,910
High education does not mean strong capability

633
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,260
If a watermelon has only a nice outer skin

634
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,530
but has no sweet melon meat,

635
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,560
no one would buy it either

636
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,660
At this point,

637
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,310
I believe Mr. Yan is a good buyer

638
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,580
That makes sense

639
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,230
Director Huang

640
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,310
Arrange for Secretary Jin to join the company

641
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,510
with a good work station

642
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,560
Why are you here?

643
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,580
Doesn't the company have a rule against visiting?

644
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,010
Mr. Yan

645
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,310
Secretary Nie is here to deliver this research reports

646
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,930
If I remember correctly,

647
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,280
you’re no longer a secretary now

648
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,880
but the archivist

649
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,280
Mr. Yan remembers

650
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,560
this very clearly

651
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,530
Secretary Jin,

652
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,880
make me a cup of coffee

653
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
OK, Mr. Yan

654
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,380
He lost his memory

655
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,710
I don't argue with him

656
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,760
Calm down, calm down

657
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,710
May I ask

658
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,880
where is the pantry, please?

659
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,910
Come on, let's keep checking this

660
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,310
I'll take you there

661
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,160
This is our pantry

662
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,660
Some commonly used electrical appliances are over here

663
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,930
There are fruits and cold drinks in the refrigerator over there

664
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
There are tea and snacks in the cupboard below

665
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,160
Thank you!

666
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,060
We just met in the elevator, right?

667
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,330
I have a senior

668
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,880
working in the headquarters of American company

669
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,260
He told me that

670
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,850
Mr. Yan has hypoglycemia,

671
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,810
so he likes sweet food

672
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,910
and he only eats pineapple candy

673
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,310
which must be even

674
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,080
Secretary Jin is really prepared

675
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,560
I'm going to deliver coffee first

676
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,710
Help yourself

677
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,560
She is now an administrator of the archives

678
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,810
but not a secretary anymore

679
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,810
Men are liars!

680
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,380
Sister Xingchen,

681
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,880
Why are you here, Xinxin?

682
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,060
It's lunchtime!

683
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,680
I'm here for you

684
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,180
and get some air by the way

685
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,880
You don't even know

686
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,780
it is too depressing in the office now

687
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,610
What's wrong?

688
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:04,130
Has something to do with the new employee?

689
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,510
Secretary Jin

690
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,430
She is simply the female version of the boss

691
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,910
She never makes mistakes in talking and working

692
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,860
We dare not chat casually

693
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,330
in the office now

694
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,680
We’re afraid that she will report to Mr. Yan when she listens

695
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
Then

696
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,310
Mr. Yan likes her very much?

697
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,680
He praised her three times in the morning

698
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,980
and tormented us

699
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,430
Sister Xingchen,

700
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,180
Don't be unhappy

701
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,880
We are all on your side

702
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,160
Let's forget all these worries

703
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,210
I brought sushi

704
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,180
Let’s eat together

705
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:42,680
Okay

706
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,630
By the way

707
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,730
How's it going between you and the doctor?

708
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,830
We haven't contacted each other since last time

709
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,830
Why?

710
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,010
I've been waiting for him to contact me actively

711
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,180
But

712
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,480
Maybe in his eyes,

713
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,810
I’m really just a little fan

714
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,960
Dr. Bai

715
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,280
is highly educated

716
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,580
and beautiful

717
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Not like me

718
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,730
I'm just a little secretary

719
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,910
It seems that there are really no other advantages except for

720
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:25,360
physical health

721
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,760
How come?

722
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,480
You're positive and optimistic,

723
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,360
full of passion for life

724
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,880
and have a big head. You're such a cutie

725
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,380
You have countless advantages

726
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,180
Really?

727
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,460
But sister Xingchen

728
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,430
If there is a more suitable person for the one

729
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,730
you like,

730
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,410
won't you give up?

731
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,430
How do you know what I want is this document?

732
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,610
By an intuition!

733
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,480
We really have more and more tacit understanding

734
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,760
Sister Xingchen

735
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,530
Of course not

736
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,010
Although the conditions are pretty good in the eyes of others,

737
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:38,410
they’re not really good for you

738
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,930
If you can see a more perfect self

739
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,210
through each other,

740
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,910
that means he's a good match

741
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,710
You mean

742
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,160
I can go on with this again?

743
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,710
Actually, I heard a sentence that

744
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,610
When you don't know how to choose,

745
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,580
you can imagine that

746
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:03,960
what kind of story do you want to tell others

747
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,630
many years later

748
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,180
Are you trying to tell someone that

749
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:10,510
years ago

750
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:13,430
I pursued one who was very good

751
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,610
with great vigor?

752
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,180
Or are you trying to tell them that

753
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,480
you missed each other

754
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,330
because of your timidity?

755
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:24,710
I see

756
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:29,930
Let's eat quickly

757
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:30,730
Okay

758
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,030
The chopsticks

759
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:37,480
Hello

760
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,160
Beauty

761
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,210
I haven't seen you, have I?

762
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:51,380
Are you new here?

763
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,780
Mr. Zhao

764
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,130
You know me?

765
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,380
I remembered the photos of all the top management of the company

766
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,480
Good! Good! Good!

767
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:03,880
Are you Xingchen's assistant?

768
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,810
I'm Mr. Yan's Chief Secretary

769
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,330
What?

770
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:10,710
Chief Secretary?

771
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,180
Mr. Yan, he...

772
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,430
Yan Jingzhi, What the hell are you doing?

773
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:28,680
Zhao Yuanfang

774
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,560
Let me ask you

775
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,110
Why did you suddenly transfer Xingchen

776
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,630
and find someone to replace her?

777
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,030
If you are defending Nie Xingchen,

778
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,310
you can go back

779
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,110
You just told me that my worry was unnecessary

780
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,310
It's only been a few days

781
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,010
I shouldn't have given you Xingchen with confidence if

782
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,710
I knew you held this attitude

783
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:49,560
What do you want to do?

784
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,410
Whatever you want

785
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,910
It's working time now

786
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,180
I'm going to a meeting

787
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,210
I can do whatever I want, right?

788
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,460
I will go to Nie Xingchen now

789
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,480
Mr. Yan

790
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,830
These are all resumes submitted by the personnel department

791
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:42,780
She is okay!

792
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,080
Give notice to her to come for an interview

793
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:46,830
Jin Beina

794
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,280
is not highly educated

795
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,730
and without rich experience

796
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,510
Why did you choose her?

797
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,610
Her photo looks pleasing to my eyes

798
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,230
Isn't this a replica of Secretary Nie?

799
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,030
Am I right?

800
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:08,980
I'll do it

801
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:17,060
Replica?

802
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,910
Secretary Nie?
