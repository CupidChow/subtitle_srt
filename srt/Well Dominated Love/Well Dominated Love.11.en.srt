1
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,420
There is no Miss Ye

2
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,070
but Miss Nie only today

3
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,890
Don't you hate me?

4
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,290
Hate?

5
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,040
I hate you

6
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,620
You left me without saying a word

7
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,340
I hate!

8
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,470
I hate you alone

9
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,690
determined our future

10
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,570
I'm sorry

11
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,890
But

12
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,590
I really didn't know how to face you

13
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,820
My father's accident was not your fault

14
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,870
Even if you didn't give him the address,

15
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,120
he also had another way to get it

16
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,620
It was his own decision

17
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,090
and had nothing to do with you

18
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,620
But it all started because of me

19
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,290
I also have half the responsibility

20
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,090
You don't need to have a burden on you mind

21
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,570
My father didn't blame you

22
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,320
Before he died,

23
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,240
he also changed his mind

24
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,720
He wanted us to be happy

25
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,420
It's all over

26
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,840
Do you

27
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,690
want to cry and listen to my confession?

28
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,490
So all this is for me?

29
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,390
You said

30
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,090
you’d be my girlfriend

31
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,190
as long as I give you a star

32
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,290
I have contacted the IAU

33
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,020
to apply for the naming rights of two asteroids

34
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,740
From now on,

35
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,140
as long as you look up at the night sky,

36
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,890
there will be two

37
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,840
stars named after us

38
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,190
accompany each other

39
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,220
Is this what you want?

40
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,320
I was just looking for a reason randomly

41
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,690
Why did you still take it seriously?

42
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,370
Because you are

43
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,220
the star that illuminates my whole universe

44
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,720
I never believed in fate before

45
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,240
but until fate made us meet again

46
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,390
And then I just thought

47
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,390
there are many things in life

48
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,020
which are already doomed

49
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,740
We have missed each other for five years

50
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,920
I don't want to wait any longer

51
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,140
Morning!

52
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,290
Did you sleep well last night?

53
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,390
Very good!

54
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,170
But I didn't

55
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,170
Why?

56
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,990
You went back to work overtime again?

57
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,690
I miss you

58
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,240
I just know now that this is the feeling of love

59
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,620
What feeling?

60
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,820
It’s that I want to see you every minute and every second

61
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,490
Yan Jingzhi,

62
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,220
you are almost thirty

63
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,220
Can you be a little bit mature?

64
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,920
You have to learn to adapt that

65
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,740
After all, for me now,

66
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,070
you’re my first love

67
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,420
Then you used to be much more reserved than you are now

68
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,970
You like the cold one

69
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,690
Why do you still stay in bed during working hours?

70
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,540
Thanks to Mr. Yan

71
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,090
I'm unemployed now

72
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,370
I can make it up to you

73
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,520
How?

74
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,520
I've decided to

75
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,540
resume your position as chief secretary from today

76
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,470
I haven't promised to go back to work yet

77
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,620
Can you bear to watch me lose sleep every day?

78
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,390
You just have pity on me!

79
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,690
Okay! Okay!

80
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,770
But I'm going to take a relaxing vacation

81
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,120
before going back to work

82
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,240
Now I am the boss

83
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,990
The boss asks you to come to work on time

84
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,140
Otherwise your wages will be deducted

85
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,090
That's it

86
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:10,920
Bye

87
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,220
No!

88
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,440
No wonder you said sweet words to me in the morning

89
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,540
And you wanted to see me every minute and every second

90
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,820
Clearly what you want is to continue to enslave me

91
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,070
Good morning, everyone!

92
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,390
Sister Xingchen

93
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,640
Who is this?

94
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,120
Secretary Nie

95
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,020
comes to see us

96
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,490
From today on,

97
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,290
I officially return to the president's office

98
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,940
Really?

99
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,920
Great!

100
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,970
I told you

101
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,020
I had a hunch to

102
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,140
to clean the table today

103
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,290
Actually,

104
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,670
after going to another company,

105
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,620
I think this is more suitable for me

106
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,620
And I miss

107
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,570
the days of working with everyone very much

108
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,620
Sister Xingchen

109
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,540
Although I am really very happy that you are back,

110
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,270
you shouldn't be abused by your boss,

111
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,390
and can't adapt to normal life, can you?

112
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,090
The boss must have provided you

113
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,820
a condition that you can't refuse can you, right?

114
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,420
Let me answer for her

115
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,440
Mr. Yan! Mr. Yan! Mr. Yan!

116
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,090
Secretary Nie

117
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,670
had a little trouble with her boyfriend before

118
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,020
In order not to affect the work,

119
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,040
she left the company

120
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,690
Now the problem is solved

121
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,470
and she come back naturally

122
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,090
Boyfriend?

123
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,140
Sister Xingchen

124
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,420
You hide too well, don't you?

125
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,790
Can’t your boyfriend be Mr. Zhao?

126
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,940
Everybody doesn't bother to guess

127
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:56,770
Let me tell you

128
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,790
Actually, Mr. Yan

129
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,420
Mr. Yan

130
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,390
I have something about work to talk to you

131
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,340
Let's go to the office

132
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,370
Actually, I... Let’s go!

133
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,290
Mr. Yan, I...

134
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,890
I… What kind of work do you have today?

135
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,940
Let's talk in the office

136
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,790
Go! Go! Go!

137
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,490
Guys

138
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,020
Take a look, everyone! Take a look!

139
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,440
Mr. Yan can see it clearly

140
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,720
the secretary Nie's emotional life

141
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,940
It means we are all

142
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,340
without any secrets

143
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,290
in front of people

144
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,570
Who on earth is her boyfriend?

145
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,620
Who on earth is it?

146
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,920
I just want to say

147
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,070
why did you stop me?

148
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,090
You still talk about that!

149
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,170
What are you doing?

150
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,940
This is the company

151
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,820
Will you behave yourself?

152
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,070
I make out with my own girlfriend

153
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,440
in my own office

154
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,890
of my own company

155
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,020
Who cares?

156
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,990
You let me get up I don't

157
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,540
I have something to tell you

158
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,390
Say it!

159
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,570
I'm not blocking your mouth

160
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,870
Don't you say it?

161
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,740
If you don't say it, I'll shut it up!

162
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,070
Wait!

163
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,020
Our positions are of sensitivity now

164
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,220
If everyone knows about our relationship,

165
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,240
there will definitely cause unnecessary speculation

166
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,020
and even to question

167
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,040
your decisions on work

168
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,620
So I think

169
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,170
it's better not to make our relationship

170
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,190
public for the time being

171
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,070
I forgot

172
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,790
secretary Nie is so good at work

173
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,520
You've even thought about all this for me

174
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,790
Putting aside the status of secretary

175
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,040
and as your girlfriend,

176
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,790
I don't either want our love life

177
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,020
is placed under a microscope

178
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,740
for everyone to discuss openly

179
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,690
Are you afraid of others talking

180
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,120
or do you have no confidence in our feelings,

181
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,170
or have you already figured out a way out for yourself?

182
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,470
I have faith in you

183
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,720
I also have confidence in our feelings, too

184
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,520
But our feelings are private,

185
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,220
I don't want to complicate my personal affairs

186
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,190
Don't overthink!

187
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,470
Let's work!

188
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,540
Work hard!

189
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,690
Can I enjoy the dinner with you tonight?

190
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,720
I heard you are going to get married

191
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
In preparation!

192
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,540
Hanna always keeps that in mind

193
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,070
How is it going between

194
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,790
you and secretary Nie?

195
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,770
Do you make any progress?

196
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,140
When did you become so nosy?

197
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,520
Mr. Yan, here is your coffee

198
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:32,820
Sorry!

199
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,170
I didn't know you had guest here

200
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,840
It’s alright

201
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,440
Secretary Nie

202
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,240
You can just leave it here

203
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,590
It doesn't matter

204
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,170
And prepare another drink for the guest

205
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,440
Secretary Nie

206
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,320
Don't bother!

207
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,140
I'll leave in a minute

208
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,040
It's okay!

209
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,690
Secretary Nie makes

210
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,540
very tasty coffee

211
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,390
Oh, my God!

212
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,720
It's really good!

213
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,540
Don't you tell me

214
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,370
this is your office culture?

215
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,570
This style doesn't match you!

216
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,890
Aren't you flying in the afternoon?

217
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,890
I'll order a car to drop you off to the airport

218
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,670
This way, please

219
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,520
OK

220
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,990
Let me give you another piece of advice

221
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,220
Men will finally adore his lady

222
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,620
Adore?

223
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,570
No way

224
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,990
Secretary Nie

225
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,390
Hanna asked me to say hello to you for her

226
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,440
You should hurry away!

227
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,740
The car is waiting for you downstairs

228
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,470
Go and bow your head!

229
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,420
I’m leaving!

230
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,820
Mr. Yan, sorry!

231
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,340
I didn't know you had guest

232
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,690
I won't make such a low-level mistake again in the future

233
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,220
Don't move!

234
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,070
You're not angry?

235
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,970
Yes, I do

236
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,190
But someone told me just now

237
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,490
that a man will finally adore his lady

238
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,340
I'm the one who coaxed you all day

239
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,040
I'm more like a man

240
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,090
Who told you to kiss the plate rather than me

241
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,620
Didn't I just kiss you?

242
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,790
I kissed you just now,

243
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,920
not you kissed me

244
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,620
Can we make it up after work?

245
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,540
No way!

246
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,120
After work, there are arrangements

247
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,490
Ok?

248
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,170
Male chauvinism

249
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,340
Secretary Nie

250
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,920
Secretary Nie

251
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,570
Director Huang

252
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,290
That's...

253
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:11,790
Don't move!

254
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,790
Keep distance!

255
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,420
I thought I stepped on something!

256
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,890
Director Huang, what can I do for you?

257
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,840
Secretary Nie

258
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,140
I want to ask you something

259
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,170
How do you handle the boss?

260
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,690
Director Huang, you misunderstood me, right?

261
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,690
Oh, my God! I'm telling you

262
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,020
what did I misunderstand

263
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,590
I have seen it all

264
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,020
The boss is obedient to you

265
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,190
You just teach me when you have time!

266
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,740
Director Huang, do you have any business?

267
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,790
I don't have any business I…

268
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,590
How can I have no business!

269
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,890
The schedule of this engineering department has come out

270
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,440
Take a look!

271
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,170
Don't move!

272
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,140
Keep distance!

273
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,940
Yes! Yes! Yes!

274
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,990
Keep distance!

275
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,420
Please have a look! Okay!

276
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,740
I'm just going to the Engineering Department

277
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,690
I'll deliver it this afternoon

278
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,320
OK

279
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,620
Keep distance!

280
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,120
You’re too close to her

281
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,070
Yan Jingzhi

282
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,240
What on earth are you doing?

283
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,320
I'm working

284
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,670
Secretary Nie

285
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,940
Then work hard!

286
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:10,920
You

287
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Nie Xingchen

288
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,920
I was just looking for you

289
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,040
You are in the company today!

290
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,490
Isn't it normal for me to be in the company?

291
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,170
It's abnormal for you to be here now, is it?

292
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,290
Go! Go! Go!

293
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,640
I still heard it from someone else's mouth

294
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,840
the news of your return

295
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:31,820
How come?

296
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,020
I just decided to come back this morning

297
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,520
You're with Yan Jing?

298
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,820
You don't tell me such a big thing

299
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,290
At least I'm a participant I…

300
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,670
Don't yell!

301
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,770
This is in the company

302
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,890
I just found out last night, too

303
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,290
Jingzhi doesn't blame me

304
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,170
And before his father died,

305
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,740
he has agreed us to be together

306
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,740
Oh!

307
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,290
There will be no burden later

308
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,240
You can relax to fall in love

309
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,920
Thank you, Yuanfang

310
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,340
If it hadn't been for your help

311
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,140
I might have left here already

312
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,420
I regret it

313
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,720
I shouldn't have meddled with this

314
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,370
Why?

315
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,040
You do have a boyfriend

316
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,990
Where's my girlfriend?

317
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,870
Who will be my shield in the future?

318
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,190
I need comfort

319
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,320
Can you be more serious?

320
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,670
I need comfort

321
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,090
Okay! Okay!

322
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,920
Let’s hug

323
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,870
Ok, ok

324
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,440
OK

325
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:42,890
Zhao Yuanfang,

326
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,390
why don't you have a serious relationship?

327
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:45,940
Alright!

328
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,570
We'll see

329
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,320
Work is important

330
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,440
OK

331
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:52,940
Go ahead! I’m leaving!

332
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,770
Go on with your work

333
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,320
Everyone

334
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,320
Great news!

335
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,020
Great news!

336
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,490
Come with me

337
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,640
Mr. Huang

338
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,870
What's the matter?

339
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,820
What did I see today?

340
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,990
I saw Secretary Nie and Mr. Zhao

341
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,940
They...

342
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,190
They should be at work

343
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,570
I give you a punch!

344
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,970
Have you ever seen the two of them do their jobs?

345
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,740
What are you doing?

346
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,790
Be aware of avoiding negative effect!

347
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,420
I…

348
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,370
You've seen this work anyway

349
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:24,990
All right! All right! All right!

350
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,690
Stop gossiping!

351
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,920
But

352
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,440
through her language description,

353
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,170
and the feeling of holding me with her,

354
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,020
I can tell you very responsibly

355
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,620
secretary Nie's mysterious boyfriend

356
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,790
must be…

357
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,370
Mr. Yan

358
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,290
It must not be Mr. Yan

359
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,940
It's Mr. Zhao

360
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,090
Why are you shaking your head?

361
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,040
You don't believe it, do you?

362
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,170
You don't believe it either, do you?

363
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,220
Do you believe it or not?

364
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:43,770
I believe!

365
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,740
Do you believe it or not?

366
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,680
I don't believe it anyway

367
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,170
This is the attitude of your president to do the work

368
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,490
He is without discipline

369
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,490
and slack

370
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,670
Director Huang

371
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,240
You take the lead in influencing work order

372
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,740
and spread false information

373
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,720
You don't want to do this post of director

374
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,920
I can change another at any time

375
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,190
You really let me down

376
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,640
Mr. Yan, I’m sorry

377
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,190
Mr. Yan, don't be angry!

378
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,120
I was wrong

379
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,820
I will be strict with myself

380
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,290
to create a clean and positive working environment

381
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,220
I am so disappointed

382
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,970
Mr. Yan

383
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,570
Secretary Nie

384
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,620
Since you're here,

385
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,070
then clarify it with everyone

386
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,540
the relationship between you and Mr. Zhao

387
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,190
Mr. Zhao and I are working partners

388
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,240
and good friends

389
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,540
Did everyone hear that?

390
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,620
I hope everyone will focus on your work

391
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,540
Don't do this kind of thing without evidence

392
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,320
Given the mistakes made by the president,

393
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,090
the month's bonus of everyone will be deducted

394
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,070
And the internal review will be conducted

395
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,420
Mr. Yan. Mr. Yan

396
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,140
Please give everyone another chance

397
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,120
for everyone is a first-time offender

398
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,540
Since secretary Nie intercede

399
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,920
Then this matter will be taken as a warning

400
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,070
I also hope that secretary Nie can be cautious

401
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,070
Don't cause such unnecessary misunderstanding

402
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,370
to affect everyone's work!

403
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,640
OK, Mr. Yan

404
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,190
Secretary Nie, come with me

405
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,170
I envy Xingchen so much!

406
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,190
She owns a wealthy boyfriend like Mr. Zhao

407
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,920
I also want that, too

408
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,590
Sister Xingchen said they’re just friends

409
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,640
Friends?

410
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,370
Love can't be made public

411
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,790
Then what's there to envy?

412
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,570
Yes!

413
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,520
They don't even have time to fall in love

414
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,170
and can only date in the company

415
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,340
That’s too bad!

416
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,170
Stop talking about it!

417
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,270
Stop gossiping!

418
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,170
OK?

419
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,890
Mr. Yan was right

420
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,420
This matter is very serious

421
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,690
I'm really disappointed in you guys

422
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,440
and in you especially

423
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,120
Can I see you shaking your head like this?

424
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,130
You have such a big head!

425
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,440
Wouldn't you shake it like that?

426
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,220
Director Huang

427
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,640
You can tell me

428
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,220
I…

429
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,570
I call Mr. Yan

430
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,620
Why do you call him?

431
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,570
Mr. Yan

432
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,090
You

433
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,420
You still laugh! ?

434
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,220
I don't laugh

435
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,890
Take it to heart!

436
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,210
Jingzhi

437
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,710
I think you are a little strange today

438
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,120
Of course

439
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,260
I’m angry

440
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,160
Do you know which animal zodiac of year I belong to?

441
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,190
You belong to me

442
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,490
What a bore!

443
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,740
Nie Xingchen

444
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,590
Don't try to say something nice

445
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,790
so I can let you get away with it

446
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,610
Zhao Yuanfang and I are friends

447
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,060
It's understandable to hug friends

448
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,530
Right?

449
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,480
You can hug others

450
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,440
but him

451
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,240
Why are you targeting him?

452
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,360
Because he is a man and he stayed

453
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,010
by your side for five years

454
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,940
Mr. Yan Jingzhi

455
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,740
Even if you're not with me,

456
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,940
you also occupy every minute

457
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,310
and every second of my life

458
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,840
Why do you stop the car?

459
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,140
Because there's something more important to do

460
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,040
Why do you walk so fast?

461
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,840
Brother, I still want to go to your house for dinner

462
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,060
Mr. Zhao, right?

463
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,960
Xingchen and I are going home to cook

464
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,490
You are welcome to visit

465
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,460
Childish!

466
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,940
Where are you going?

467
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,040
To change into pajamas

468
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,840
Is it necessary to be so particular?

469
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,090
Of course it is necessary

470
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,540
Here you are!

471
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,590
You’re cooking!

472
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,860
What a coincidence!

473
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,840
What coincidence?

474
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,190
Aren't you just here to have a meal?

475
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,390
Welcome! Mr. Zhao

476
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,260
You are welcome

477
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,460
I’ll come here often

478
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,140
I'll go to the kitchen to cook first

479
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,810
You two just chat for a while

480
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,460
Mr. Zhao, please sit down

481
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,390
The formaldehyde will be added to

482
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,110
the dye this kind in the production process

483
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,940
Thereby it produces viruses and bacteria,

484
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,080
which is harmful to health

485
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,960
In short

486
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,010
you are poisonous

487
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,340
This is my personal tailor

488
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,660
There is absolutely no problem with quality

489
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,010
And you’re needless to worry

490
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,460
that there must be no poison

491
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,290
If Mr. Zhao is like it,

492
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,540
I can also order a poisonous one for you

493
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,840
Childish!

494
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,190
Come on,

495
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,810
let's have dinner

496
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,740
Why don't both of you eat?

497
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,690
We’re waiting for you?

498
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,590
The taste is different from usual today

499
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,840
Do you have a dog's nose?

500
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,660
There is no citronella today

501
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,660
You still remember my taste in Thai food

502
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,960
It is because of you that I’ve learned Thai food

503
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,260
How can I not remember?

504
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,360
Every time you couldn't eat spicy food, you insisted on eating it

505
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,710
Come on!

506
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,610
Have a drink

507
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,990
Did you make this spoon by yourself?

508
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,240
Yes!

509
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,340
We made it together!

510
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,210
Is it good to use?

511
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,240
It’s especially good to use!

512
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,340
Where is the gift I sent you last time?

513
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,460
A minute please!

514
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,740
How come I have yours, too?

515
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,110
The two of them should have been together

516
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,240
How about this? Mr. Zhao

517
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,440
It seems that Yan's overall practical ability is not very strong

518
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,390
Never mind

519
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,190
As long as Xingchen likes it

520
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,290
Now a couple love each other because distance produces beauty

521
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,910
You work together every day

522
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,510
It will get tired after a long time

523
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,060
Some people say that office romance won't last long

524
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,860
What do you think, Mr. Yan

525
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,540
I only believe in objective basis

526
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,270
According to the

527
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,640
big data comparison results of big cities,

528
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,640
office romance

529
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,240
will become the mainstream way to get off the market in big cities

530
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,790
Excuse me

531
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,890
The food is getting cold

532
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,560
Why don't we finish eating and talk later?

533
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,490
This topic is related to you

534
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,610
Why don't you have any sense of participation?

535
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,260
Pay attention to your speaking attitude

536
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,210
She is used to it

537
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,360
This has to be put in the right way

538
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,010
I'll go up and place it first

539
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,340
You continue to chat

540
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,540
You two work in the same place

541
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,560
After a long time, there will be no distinction between the public and the private

542
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,890
Thereby the contradiction appears

543
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,840
Especially because of the nature of your work

544
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,960
You’re inseparable every day

545
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,740
Over time, it will produce aesthetic fatigue

546
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,940
and you’ll lose freshness

547
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,060
Mr. Zhao worked with Xingchen for five years

548
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,340
This is a conversation of experience

549
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,260
Sure

550
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,040
Once Xingchen tried to convince me

551
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,090
to agree to a plan

552
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,140
She set a record

553
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,590
a week's history of being stationed in my home

554
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,410
Every day she cooked,

555
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,010
cleaned,

556
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:00,740
was obedient

557
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,060
to me

558
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,310
I have a psychological shadow now

559
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,440
I afraid of getting up someday that

560
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,960
she will be staring at me right next to my bed

561
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,710
Mr. Zhao and I are different

562
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,840
Xingchen and I have a very good understanding at work

563
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,860
We don't affect our feelings because of our work

564
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,860
And

565
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,710
I'm reluctant for Xingchen to be obedient to me

566
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,910
I'd rather I would be obedient to her

567
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,590
So you don’t need to bother to think about us

568
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,440
It better be

569
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,410
I'll keep an eye on you

570
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,510
Whatever

571
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,540
Don't we wait Xingchen to eat together?

572
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,460
Come on! Have a taste!

573
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,610
Is it sweet?

574
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:46,790
Yes

575
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,710
Has Yuanfang gone?

576
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,640
Let me have a look

577
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,440
Isn't it nice that he left?

578
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
He’s quite sensible!

579
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,060
Yan Jingzhi,

580
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,990
Only animals use their own smell

581
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,060
to occupy territory

582
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,940
This is the instinct of carnivores

583
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,040
Yours is already in my house

584
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,010
and I take it for you

585
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,290
It's getting late

586
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,940
Shouldn't you go home?

587
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:30,690
The…

588
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,740
The fruit has just been cut to pieces

589
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,860
I have to eat before I go

590
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,410
Jingzhi

591
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,810
The two of us had a leisure time

592
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,410
Why don't we do something meaningful?

593
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,710
Like?

594
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,040
Like doing something

595
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,290
that’s fun

596
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,260
and also technical

597
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,140
Alright

598
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,340
Then you can wait for me upstairs

599
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,590
Okay, I'll wait for you

600
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,060
What are you doing in the room?

601
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,410
Come here

602
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:41,590
You

603
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,290
It’s because you’re so tall

604
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,240
Come and sit down

605
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,890
This is what you told me

606
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,340
the fun

607
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,090
game with skills

608
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,290
Yeah!

609
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,160
Listen to me to introduce you first

610
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,660
Come on!

611
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,540
This

612
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,940
is a turntable

613
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,740
We can write

614
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,890
the requirements for completion for each other

615
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:08,990
on it

616
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,090
If one of us turns to this,

617
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,990
the other will execute unconditionally

618
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,190
Is there an interest in couples' interaction

619
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,310
and also requirements for competitive technology

620
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,710
Are you sure you will follow the rules of the game?

621
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,140
Sure!

622
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,540
I guarantee it with my salary and bonus

623
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,840
Then come on!

624
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,510
Let's start then

625
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,390
Let's start!

626
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,910
Secret love

627
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,640
This is clearly a plot

628
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,260
I may not be able to turn it to that

629
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,080
Come on!

630
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,040
Such a big turntable

631
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,460
You have to stick it next to me

632
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,540
You don't understand this, do you?

633
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,410
In that case, it's possible for me

634
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,640
to take advantage of the fishermen

635
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,890
Make the relationship public

636
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,510
Villain

637
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,790
Peace

638
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,290
I hope you will live in peace with Yuanfang

639
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,140
I want you to keep your distance from him

640
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,440
No!

641
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,090
He is my best friend

642
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,260
Then

643
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,290
Then at least keep your distance in the company

644
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:36,860
That’s okay!

645
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,710
Deal

646
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,910
Let's start then

647
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,290
I'll start first

648
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,610
I thought you’r e very good at this

649
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,640
It turns out you're not

650
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,740
Your turn!

651
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,690
Look, there's coriander there

652
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,510
No, it’s a flying saucer

653
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,540
Look over there

654
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:08,910
Yan Jingzhi,

655
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,110
You are such a cute little girl

656
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,040
Come on! Cheers!

657
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,210
I didn't over you anyway

658
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,440
OK

659
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,160
Then I’ll let you win this time

660
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:16,910
Your turn!

661
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,040
Remember!

662
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,560
Keep a distance from Zhao Yuanfang,

663
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,340
at least you do that in the company

664
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,810
OK, Mr. Yan

665
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,210
OK

666
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,710
Then we’ve made our first couple turntable competition

667
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,960
a success

668
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,510
We’ve achieved something

669
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,140
Come on!

670
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:43,840
Have a toast!

671
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,190
In fact,

672
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,810
these are too childish

673
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,740
What I want to play most is

674
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,460
going home and not going home

675
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,590
Domestic violence!

676
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,590
Here you are!

677
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,110
Are there any guests at home?

678
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,390
Yeah!

679
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,760
Honey

680
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,960
Is breakfast ready yet?

681
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,390
It'll be okay!

682
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,010
Guest's surname is Ye

683
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:30,690
Yes

684
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,060
Except yes

685
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,740
isn't there anything else you want to tell me?

686
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,190
You didn't see it last time

687
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,460
And you can take this opportunity to meet

688
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,590
OK

689
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,160
I'd like to see

690
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,690
who is the Miss Ye

691
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:46,860
Get away!

692
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,610
Xingchen

693
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,090
I finally see you again

694
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,240
Are you Miss Ye?

695
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,410
Yes!

696
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,240
I

697
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,960
am the mother of the scenery

698
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,760
You can call me Miss Ye

699
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,310
You can also call me mom directly

700
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,940
Please don't call me aunt

701
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,410
I don't want to be called as an old woman

702
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,940
You guys continue chatting

703
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,810
I have to go to work

704
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,810
and I won't accompany you

705
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,060
I'll go with you

706
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,440
I'm leaving at noon

707
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,690
Can you just stay with me more time?

708
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,290
Your only job today

709
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,760
is to take my mother to the airport

710
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,610
By the way, to cultivate the feelings of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law

711
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,790
Ignore him

712
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,610
Come! Come over here! Come over here!

713
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,190
I have so much to talk to you about

714
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,260
Come and sit down, Xingchen

715
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,010
Sit down! Sit down!

716
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,290
Sit down!

717
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,340
Jingzhi

718
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,610
Is my breakfast ready yet?

719
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,590
It'll be okay!

720
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,810
Hurry up!

721
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,490
Don't delay my flight

722
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,410
Xingchen

723
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,760
I wanted to ask you last time

724
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,060
How do you maintain your skin?

725
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,610
It’s so tender and smooth

726
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,040
Thank you, aunt

727
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,810
You call me aunt again!

728
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,160
No, Miss Ye

729
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,140
I called wrong! Miss Ye

730
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,340
I took a picture of you last time

731
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,840
I've always kept it

732
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,860
I like the photos you took

733
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,860
I am very thin and beautiful on the photo

734
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,010
Miss Zhen,

735
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,640
you are hiding here!

736
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,190
I've been looking for you all day!

737
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,740
Why does Miss Zhen like boxing so much?

738
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,390
Many people say it

739
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,090
Boxing is the sport of the brave

740
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,240
Even if you encounter powerful opponents and difficulties,

741
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,960
you will be persistent and patient

742
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,810
But I feel Miss Zhen

743
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,010
didn't learn the essence of boxing

744
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,140
If you're here to fight

745
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,010
I can accompany you

746
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,690
If it's about endorsement,

747
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,490
my position has been expressed very clearly

748
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,860
There is no need to talk again

749
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,690
I can practice a game with you

750
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,790
But we need to make it a deal

751
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,940
If you lose too badly, don't leave early!

752
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,060
It is not certain who loses badly

753
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,140
OK

754
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,660
What are you doing?

755
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,340
Let’s conduct a fair competition

756
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,910
Otherwise, there is no sense of accomplishment when you win

757
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,010
Then don't regret it

758
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,310
Come on!

759
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,210
The biggest difference between men and women is that

760
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,560
women are easy to get emotional

761
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
Even if you get hurt in the end,

762
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,090
you don't know how to stop loss in time

763
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,340
Am I right?

764
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,340
You just mind your own business

765
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,190
I am the successful case

766
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,320
I work with rivals in love,

767
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,060
share his dividend

768
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,810
and earn his money

769
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,250
I don't be like Miss Zhen

770
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,690
You finally lost your fortune and luck

771
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,990
I just don't want to have anything to do with the past

772
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,790
Nothing has to do with that!

773
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,860
You're just scared, timid and empty

774
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,440
You don't even have the guts to stand in front of them

775
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,760
You are still a goddess of positive energy

776
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,310
It is simply a lie to deceive the public

777
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:46,960
You

778
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,110
Show some adult reason

779
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,310
and don't go against the reality

780
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,760
For the sake of fighting with me

781
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,640
I can keep Quwo

782
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,990
But I insisted on breaking the contract

783
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,640
Miss Zhen has a big strength of the hand

784
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,210
Director Huang

785
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,390
Secretary Nie

786
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:40,760
Secretary Nie

787
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,090
You asked for leave in the morning?

788
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:42,890
Yeah

789
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,860
I was to see a relative off at the airport

790
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:46,860
Secretary Nie

791
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,360
What are you doing tonight?

792
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,490
Nothing!

793
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,310
The…

794
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,210
I've finished talking to everyone

795
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,690
What about today

796
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,940
I’ll hold a housewarming party

797
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:54,810
How about let’s go to there together?

798
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,910
Alright

799
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,240
I will definitely go for such a good thing

800
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,210
Congratulations, director Huang

801
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:58,910
Thank you! Thank you!

802
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,510
What sound?

803
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,590
Who brought the cat to the office?

804
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,190
Tong Xin, is that you?

805
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,010
No, it's not me

806
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,360
It seems that came in the direction of secretary Nie

807
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,240
Really?

808
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,310
This…this…

809
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,440
This is that… that… that…

810
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,360
our boss buy it when he visited the mall?

811
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,090
Two!

812
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:26,940
Two!

813
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:27,490
Yeah

814
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,260
Oh, God! I almost forgot

815
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,590
This is what the boss asked me to give away

816
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,060
I haven't packed them yet

817
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,890
I heard that as long as you log in to the software,

818
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,660
you can print and send anything

819
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,840
Can we have a look?

820
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,140
Who is the boss giving it to?

821
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,660
Is this inappropriate?

822
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,900
You are so smart and big-headed!

823
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,140
Don't you understand this?

824
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,740
You can't look at the privacy of your boss

825
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,690
Stop shaking your head!

826
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:52,740
Go back to work!

827
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,190
Director Huang

828
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,610
I’m sorry

829
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,160
to bother you

830
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,840
The work download software

831
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,790
download software

832
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,990
You can just edit and send by mobile phone

833
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,510
and each other's meow machine

834
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,240
can get your message note

835
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,190
Xingchen

836
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,960
I love you

837
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,010
Where are you?

838
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,460
Today, it’s the housewarming party of director Huang

839
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,890
We're all at his house

840
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,840
Because of director Huang,

841
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,410
you left me alone at home

842
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,860
Can you see this place?

843
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,560
Let’s empty here

844
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,210
and to install an elevator

845
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,060
This

846
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,410
This... Raise the ceiling high!

847
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,660
I didn't know you are in my house either

848
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,960
The…

849
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,010
I'll pick you up

850
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,940
No! No! No!

851
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,810
It's hard for everyone to have dinner today

852
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,290
Make your own arrangements at night!

853
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,040
I’m hanging up!

854
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,090
Secretary Nie

855
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,160
Director Huang

856
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,510
Is there any ceremony before eating in your home?

857
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:44,940
No!

858
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,460
I'm so excited!

859
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,060
I'm so excited!

860
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,940
I didn't expect my Huang Tao

861
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,160
would live in such a nice house one day

862
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:53,790
Really?

863
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,460
You are also lucky dogs

864
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,890
You could go one step ahead of my lover

865
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,990
and witnessed this historic moment

866
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,790
Really?

867
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,640
We don’t…

868
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,310
We don't forget the digger when we drink water

869
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,740
Thanks to Mr. Yan

870
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,540
The first cup is to Mr. Yan

871
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:10,740
Wish…

872
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,810
Why is this light so low?

873
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,910
If Mr. Yan comes, he can touch it with his head

874
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,160
By the way, director Huang

875
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,460
Why didn't you invite Mr. Yan here?

876
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,860
Can Mr. Yan be invited if I want?

877
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,060
Mr. Yan is very busy

878
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,690
Indeed!

879
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,860
He has been busy all day

880
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,610
How can he come and join us?

881
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:28,880
Yeah

882
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,240
I don't want to invite

883
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,940
I want…

884
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,560
I…

885
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,440
OK, let's not talk about that

886
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:35,240
Come and give a distant wish

887
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:35,650
Come on,

888
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,890
Wish him good health

889
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:37,910
and all the best!

890
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,110
Okay! Come on! Come on! Come on!

891
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,090
Come on,

892
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,340
And let’s eat the dishes!

893
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,240
Today it is all on me!

894
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,460
It's all on me!

895
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,810
Sister-in-law is back!

896
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,490
I don't know if your sister-in-law will come back

897
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:53,690
Big head

898
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,840
Get the door!

899
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:57,990
Director

900
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,310
I sit so far,

901
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,360
you even ask me to get the door!

902
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,340
You come to our house for dinner

903
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,040
You must get familiar with the environment

904
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,740
Besides, you can walk for digestion

905
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,310
Go! Go! Go! Okay!

906
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:08,810
I'll go, I'll go

907
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,040
Put them in

908
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,360
Mushroom...

909
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,810
Put all in

910
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,060
Boss?

911
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,210
It’s a deliveryman of alcohol, right?

912
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:17,940
Just let him put the alcohol at the door

913
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:19,960
Move down!

914
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:22,860
Put the meat in!

915
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,260
Freely!

916
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,090
Mr. Yan. Mr. Yan. Mr. Yan

917
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,010
Mr…. Mr.Yan, why are you here?

918
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,740
Your new home is nice

919
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,060
I didn't even think of

920
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,960
it that you can show up

921
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:38,290
You have come to our house

922
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,960
I’m really flattered!

923
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,590
This is the housewarming gift

924
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,240
This...

925
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,810
Sun Yang,

926
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:52,990
make room for me. Come on!

927
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,690
This may make a difference in my house

928
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,690
Er...

929
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:04,490
Mr. Yan

930
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:05,560
Please sit here

931
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,040
Don't bother

932
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,210
I'll just sit here

933
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,190
After all, it is your home

934
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:13,740
You are so easy-going

935
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:15,590
Sit

936
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,040
Sit down! Sit down!

937
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,180
I'm sorry

938
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:43,510
What's this?

939
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,240
This?

940
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,160
This...

941
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:50,160
Mr. Yan

942
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,660
This is the star product in our shop

943
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,910
It's very popular among couples

944
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,610
By the way,

945
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,010
as long as one of the couple

946
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,090
writes something,

947
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,090
the other will

948
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,740
get a card with information

949
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,460
It is very suitable for study and life

950
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,190
Moreover,

951
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,010
it can also increase the interaction between couples

952
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,360
I wanna two

953
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,360
OK

954
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,340
Two!

955
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,790
Two!

956
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:29,310
Go! Go! Go!
