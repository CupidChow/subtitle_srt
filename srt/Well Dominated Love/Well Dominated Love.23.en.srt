1
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,950
Your proposal

2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,800
will start from here

3
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,220
Miss Nie will come up here from the stairs

4
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,420
This is the place you're gonna propose

5
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,520
After the proposal

6
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,540
we have a very romantic dinner arranged

7
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,980
for you two to have a perfect engagement night

8
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,430
So what do you think of this plan?

9
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,830
Just do it in your way

10
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,700
OK

11
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,770
Are really taking me to the Fantasy Town?

12
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:56,910
Do you like that?

13
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,680
I'm planning to visit it

14
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,490
But

15
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,640
how could you want to go there too?

16
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,480
I've heard that it is a great place for date

17
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,340
But you are going to

18
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,490
meet Mr. Fu of Yuanyang Corp this afternoon

19
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,420
and the bank...

20
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,590
I've told Director Huang

21
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,250
to rearrange all your work

22
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,150
So the only thing for you to do it to get dressed

23
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,040
and come with me

24
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,280
Yes, Mr. Yan

25
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,020
We will be there in an hour

26
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,210
Let's take the bus

27
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,890
It's not convenient

28
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,990
How come?

29
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,220
We are not in a hurry

30
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,850
You liked taking bus

31
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,200
back in college

32
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,630
Don't you remember?

33
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,630
How long it'll take by bus?

34
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,470
One transfer will be needed

35
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,860
About one hour and a half

36
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,150
OK

37
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:51,800
You're the boss

38
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,060
We'll be there in one hour and a half

39
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,000
Sorry

40
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,070
I didn't expect the bus would take so long to be here

41
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,830
To be with you

42
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,170
I can always experience

43
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,020
something unforgettable

44
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,630
What's so funny?

45
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,400
I just remember

46
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,870
the last time

47
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,600
when we were here waiting for the bus

48
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,630
Last time you just ran into my arms

49
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:51,860
All right

50
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,280
Let me make a call

51
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,620
Hello

52
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,230
I'm calling to check on

53
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,230
the bus No. 23 which we've waited

54
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,530
at the station for an hour

55
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,820
I see

56
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,650
Alright

57
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:17,970
What happened?

58
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,320
Bus No. 23 is out of service

59
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,160
but they haven't change the station sign yet

60
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,820
Why don't we walk there?

61
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,760
It's too far to walk

62
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,610
I know a shortcut

63
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,780
and come with me

64
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,830
Jingzhi

65
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,830
Let me down

66
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,460
Be careful

67
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,510
Watch out

68
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,750
You see

69
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,650
It's so beautiful here

70
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,470
What's so beautiful?

71
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,740
The sun is setting

72
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,710
We didn't make it to the Fantasy Town

73
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,330
but we come across

74
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,430
such a nice place

75
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,320
The surprise along the way

76
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,830
is also memorable

77
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,630
Don't you think it's a pity?

78
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,450
No

79
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,330
As long as I'm with you

80
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,810
I will be happy anywhere

81
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,860
I'm not that into the Fantasy Town actually

82
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,770
You don't have to comfort me

83
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,570
I knew you've done lots of research

84
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,930
That's why you wanna go there with me

85
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,640
Actually I wanna to assess the place

86
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,020
because our company will build

87
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,080
an entertainment complex like that in the future

88
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,970
I'm really not good at

89
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,950
making a surprise

90
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,110
You just ask me

91
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,510
What do you like?

92
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,240
I like you

93
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,330
Nie Xingchen

94
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,720
Since my last proposal failed

95
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,310
I was going to

96
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,300
put this ring on your finger

97
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,230
at the Town

98
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,630
but now,

99
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,020
I don't want to wait anymore

100
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,390
Nie Xingchen

101
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,780
Do you wanna spend the rest of your life with me?

102
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,960
Yes, I do

103
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,580
Wait

104
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,260
I remember that I have a video conference

105
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,200
You go to sleep first

106
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,790
Good morning

107
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,990
Good morning, Xingchen

108
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,880
Xingchen

109
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,360
Look at the ring on her finger

110
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,250
You see

111
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,930
Congratulations, Secretary Nie

112
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,420
You accepted boss's proposal

113
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,220
I kept the secret for several days

114
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,040
Boss asked us for more information

115
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,220
in order to propose to you

116
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,330
But sadly

117
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,460
we didn't do a good job for him

118
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,030
Tell us

119
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,400
how he did it

120
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,860
Well

121
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,230
it's complicated

122
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,810
but the place was beautiful

123
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,840
Look at the dark circles around your eyes

124
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,240
You two must did some

125
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,580
hot stuff for celebration

126
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,760
What are you talking about?

127
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,550
Alright, it's time to work

128
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,600
Let's go to work

129
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,120
Right, let's go

130
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,570
Xingchen

131
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,080
let me see it again

132
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,980
How did he propose?

133
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,510
Mr. Yan

134
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,730
what do you want me for?

135
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,630
OK

136
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,320
OK

137
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,560
I'm on it

138
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,330
What's wrong, Director Huang?

139
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,020
Mr. Yan said he's going to Beijing

140
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,300
and he wants me to go with him

141
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,890
Boss left Xingchen alone

142
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,980
right after he proposed

143
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,960
You don't understand it

144
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,710
He's just afraid he can't control himself

145
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,480
and makes his girlfriend too tired

146
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,210
Like you know everything

147
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,510
Shut up

148
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,830
Go to work

149
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,800
Come on

150
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:53,910
Surprise

151
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,390
Xingchen

152
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,530
What are you doing here?

153
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,580
Today

154
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,120
Xingchen accepted my proposal

155
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,850
but I just couldn't be close to her

156
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:15,780
I'm afraid

157
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,580
after I wake up

158
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,220
I may forget her again

159
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,680
How long will it take for me

160
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,020
to get over the damn amnesia?

161
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,570
It's going to drive us crazy

162
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,320
Because I missed you of course!

163
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,890
What's the look?

164
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,210
Are you hiding some girl in here?

165
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,800
Welcome

166
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,550
Then I'm gonna help myself

167
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,910
Yan Jingzhi, what are you doing?

168
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,300
I have work to do

169
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,420
You may have a rest here

170
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,160
Yan Jingzhi

171
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,680
Yan Jingzhi

172
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,500
You wake up

173
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,850
How's the sleep?

174
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,220
Fine

175
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,130
How about you?

176
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,390
Very well

177
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,620
My phone is ringing

178
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,360
Wait for me

179
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,210
Hello

180
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,570
Mother Ye

181
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,080
You're coming back to Jinghai?

182
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,270
I'm not busy

183
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,810
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning

184
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,120
OK

185
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,150
See you tomorrow morning

186
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,740
OK, bye

187
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,230
It seems

188
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,240
you have surpassed my place

189
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,930
in Ms. Ye's heart

190
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,330
Sorry

191
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,910
I can't stay here with you

192
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,720
I feel so sad

193
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:54,920
if

194
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,330
you don't wanna go,

195
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,420
I can ask the drive to pick her up

196
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,770
No

197
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,760
Your mom rarely comes to Jinghai

198
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,880
How can both of us not show up?

199
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,020
I'll go pick her up

200
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,210
Thank you

201
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,540
Breakfast is ready

202
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,390
Let's have it together

203
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,950
Yan Jingzhi

204
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,370
You look nice in this dress

205
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,790
It so fits you

206
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,180
I'll take it then

207
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,760
OK

208
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,910
Have a drink

209
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:09,770
Thank you

210
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,350
Xingchen

211
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,460
I'm coming to

212
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,230
ask you another favor

213
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,130
What can I do for you?

214
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,440
You see

215
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,650
you and Jingzhi

216
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,200
have already engaged

217
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,720
Should I

218
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,330
meet your parents officially?

219
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,770
I wanna ask you

220
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,870
to have your parents come to Jinghai

221
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,840
so we can have a meal together

222
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,170
and discuss about your wedding

223
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,600
There is no need to rush

224
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,430
There is!

225
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,730
You two get married this year,

226
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,130
then you can have a baby next year

227
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,340
How lovely

228
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,970
I'm getting on board

229
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,580
I'll be home at around 8 o'clock

230
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,980
Mother Ye

231
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,800
Later

232
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,660
What are you calling me?

233
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,140
Mom

234
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,230
Good girl

235
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,210
Let's go

236
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,030
grab a bite

237
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,730
and wait for Jingzhi to have dinner

238
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,620
How does this sound?

239
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,060
I have plans tonight

240
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,360
I'll leave you two alone

241
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,290
Xingchen

242
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,450
I thought you are in the next door

243
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,460
Absence makes the heart grow fonder

244
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,390
How can I leave you here?

245
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,610
Are you drunk?

246
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,040
A little

247
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,890
to encourage myself

248
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:20,970
What are you going to do?

249
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,660
What am I going to do?

250
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,460
You...

251
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,120
You calm down first

252
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,000
Me too

253
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,350
Drinking on an empty stomach is bad for your health

254
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,400
Let me cook something for you

255
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,130
Yan Jingzhi

256
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,200
You don't need to avoid me

257
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,950
I've read your diary

258
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,520
Xingchen

259
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,010
I need more time

260
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:03,650
But we are going

261
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,140
to do it sooner or later

262
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,280
To be with you

263
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,270
is enough for me

264
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,440
I don't wanna spoil our happiness now

265
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,100
You forgot your proposal the first time you lost your memory

266
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,920
But for this time

267
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,420
I've got a ring on my finger

268
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,720
and you are fine

269
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,430
It means everything is going to a better way

270
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,320
doesn't it?

271
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,500
And

272
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,430
You've always liked high risk, high return investments

273
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,020
Now

274
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,780
do you dare to bet with me?

275
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,660
Yan Jingzhi

276
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,810
I tried so hard

277
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,820
How can you say no to me again?

278
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,300
Who are you?

279
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,540
I'm Xingchen

280
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,420
Your fiancee

281
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,500
Don't you remember me?

282
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,510
I don't care who you are

283
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,150
Get out of here right now

284
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,670
You see

285
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,100
This is your diary

286
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,730
You can't forget your handwriting

287
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,380
This is a picture of us

288
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,050
And this

289
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,450
This is the engagement ring you gave me

290
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:10,810
Do you remember?

291
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,120
You can't take it off before we get married

292
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,890
Yan Jingzhi

293
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,970
How can you make this kind of joke?

294
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,950
I was too nervous to sleep last night

295
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,690
Now you...

296
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,740
Don't lie to me anymore

297
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,200
Alright

298
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,670
We won, didn't we?

299
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,180
Don't lie to me anymore

300
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,650
It hurts

301
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,350
You hit me too hard

302
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,120
It hurts so much

303
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,780
Get up

304
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,830
You didn't sleep last night

305
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,030
Get more sleep

306
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,520
Yan Jingzhi

307
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,200
This

308
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,420
Here you are

309
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,940
Everything goes where they should be

310
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,090
Let me hang you in here

311
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:35,640
Darling

312
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,560
Thanks

313
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,090
What?

314
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,410
Let me tie your hair

315
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,950
Why?

316
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,360
Your hair is everywhere

317
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,450
You think it's gross?

318
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,210
I just don't want you to lose all your hair

319
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,570
It's anti-hair loss

320
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,140
Look, how pretty you are

321
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,110
Your face looks smaller

322
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,480
If we have a girl in the future

323
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,710
I will tie her hair like this

324
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,180
It's nice

325
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,260
Very nice

326
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,230
You take your time

327
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,280
I'll go take a nap

328
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:15,920
Wake me up when it's ready

329
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,360
You bad boy

330
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,430
Dad,

331
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,850
you can take off your coat

332
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,400
Yes

333
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,130
we are about to be family

334
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,180
Comfort matters the most

335
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,650
Ms. Ye,

336
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,260
thank you

337
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:48,820
Ms. Ye,

338
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,400
Thank you very much

339
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,980
for inviting us to Jinghai

340
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,370
We heard you've been living abroad

341
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,110
Yes

342
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,820
About this,

343
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,070
you two rest assured

344
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,930
After the two get married

345
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,300
they will live their own life

346
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,450
I will not bother them

347
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,020
We didn't mean that

348
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,770
We just want to know you better

349
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,900
since we meet for the first time

350
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,590
I agree

351
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,210
I'm telling you

352
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,140
This time

353
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,820
I come here for a world...

354
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,550
Mom

355
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,070
Uncle and aunt

356
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,590
Let's eat

357
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,590
Let's talk over dinner

358
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:24,950
OK

359
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:25,750
Yes

360
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,660
You see

361
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,590
I keep talking

362
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,200
Let's eat

363
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,100
Help yourself

364
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,370
OK

365
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,380
Uncle

366
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,840
It takes just 15 seconds for the meat to be done

367
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,720
Let me help you

368
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,310
Yan

369
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,170
is a careful man

370
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,000
Quite careful

371
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,150
If our Xingxing

372
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,600
does anything improper

373
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,260
on work or life,

374
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,370
please forgive her

375
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,520
Uncle

376
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,960
Xingchen does a good job

377
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,110
I'm the one should be tolerated

378
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,940
This two have experienced so much

379
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,630
It's not easy for them

380
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,080
if you two agree,

381
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,100
we may fix

382
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,410
the wedding day for them

383
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,610
Well...

384
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,560
How about next month?

385
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,900
Next month?

386
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,350
Isn't this a bit rush?

387
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:21,880
Yes

388
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,010
Uncle

389
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,150
Xingchen and I have missed many years

390
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,740
I wanna be her husband

391
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,880
for a longer time

392
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,200
and take care of her

393
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,610
for you

394
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,810
Yan

395
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,670
Pick up your glass

396
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:53,440
OK

397
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,170
and drink it

398
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,650
then you will be the son-in-law of my family

399
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,640
As for the wedding day

400
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,270
you may decide for yourself

401
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,590
Thank you, uncle

402
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,760
You silly boy

403
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:10,940
Uncle?

404
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,950
Thanks, Dad

405
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,270
Thanks, Mom

406
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,200
Let's drink together

407
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,820
Let's cheers!

408
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,810
Come on

409
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,980
Congratulations!

410
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,310
Xingxing

411
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:26,860
Thanks

412
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,400
Xingxing

413
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,120
Thanks, Mom

414
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,250
Good girl

415
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,000
Sit down

416
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,950
Let's sit

417
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,790
Come on

418
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,750
Let's eat

419
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,330
OK

420
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,080
I'll have something

421
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,260
to drink with

422
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,770
The bigger one's decoration is not good

423
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,550
The smaller one's not fancy enough

424
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,350
Do you have something I want?

425
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,980
Mr. Yan

426
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,840
For the famous hotels in Jinghai

427
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,460
We have to book from half a year to one year in advance

428
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,840
You are in such a hurry

429
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,570
It's hard to find a good one

430
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,790
That's your problem

431
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,230
The hotel can't be far from the downtown

432
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,730
or a noisy region

433
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,510
Mr. Yan

434
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,450
Your wife is here

435
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:39,800
What happened?

436
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:40,940
Don't you know me?

437
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,530
What a beauty!

438
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,660
Let's go

439
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,020
We only have three hours

440
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,560
We have a meeting this afternoon

441
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,330
Let's go!

442
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,000
Three hours?

443
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,820
Isn't that too short?

444
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:54,950
Get ready

445
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,720
Let me get this

446
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,020
Hello

447
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,830
Hello

448
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,530
It doesn't matter

449
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,070
Shoot me first

450
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,560
OK

451
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,190
Good, stay still

452
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,740
Sorry, it's emergency

453
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,310
Hello

454
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:21,860
Hello

455
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,030
OK

456
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,530
Sorry

457
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,140
Keep going

458
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,100
OK

459
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,220
Now we don't need the flower

460
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,090
Miss Nie

461
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,710
Your wedding is ten days later

462
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,140
But now the hotel

463
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,730
or the site hasn't got ready yet

464
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,910
We are worried that

465
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,360
we can't get ready

466
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,320
before the wedding

467
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,660
Didn't you start the preparation from a long time ago?

468
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,430
We had enough time

469
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,140
but Mr. Yan is the most demanding customer

470
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,700
we've ever seen

471
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,480
We've 12 visions of plans

472
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,380
just for the site

473
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,900
Here is the design draft

474
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,700
You may have a look

475
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,490
If you think it's good,

476
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,160
could you please help us to persuade Mr. Yan?

477
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:21,760
OK

478
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,000
Look at the pictures

479
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,380
Thank you for your hard work

480
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,230
That's not gonna work

481
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,390
Can we

482
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,430
take some sweet pictures?

483
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,350
OK, no problem

484
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,870
The pictures we took are not bad

485
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,530
But we

486
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,000
should have taken more pictures

487
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:39,930
when the sun light was sufficient

488
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,650
You can check the pictures

489
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,130
If there is something unsatisfactory,

490
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,300
we can do it again

491
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,460
Jingzhi

492
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,580
I understand you wanna give me

493
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,030
a perfect wedding

494
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,680
I've seen

495
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,680
the latest version of plan

496
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,660
In fact

497
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,520
it is perfect for me

498
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,260
Could you not be that strict

499
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,080
and allow them to go on with their job

500
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,530
You may not get a perfect wedding

501
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,120
but you are still thinking about others

502
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,020
To be honest

503
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,180
your standard of wedding

504
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,000
is a little too much to me

505
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,160
And we have announced

506
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,510
the date of our wedding

507
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,010
If it's really postponed,

508
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,350
it'll be a trouble for us

509
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,290
A trouble?

510
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,180
That's how you see our wedding?

511
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,170
No

512
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,710
Don't get me wrong

513
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,680
I'm talking about the matter at hand

514
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,790
If you care about my wedding

515
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,870
You wouldn't be so indifferent now

516
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,700
That's because I trust you

517
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,840
Then don't interfere with my decision

518
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,670
Dear Mr. Yan Jingzhi,

519
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,940
may I invite you to dance with me?

520
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:41,930
You won't go to sleep

521
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,690
just for inviting me to dance with you

522
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,430
Do you remember

523
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,110
why you bought me this ring?

524
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,650
Yes

525
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,960
It's because you like the low-key style

526
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,980
So compared with a fancy wedding,

527
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,230
I prefer the sweet normal life

528
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,860
I did not pay no attention to our wedding

529
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,410
It's because that

530
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,580
I think we already have

531
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,360
what's more important than that

532
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,530
Sorry

533
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,150
I didn't control my emotions properly

534
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,510
I did something wrong too

535
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,990
I shouldn't have left everything to you

536
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,480
How about

537
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,820
we make the decision

538
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,120
about the plan tonight

539
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,160
You're the boss

540
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,780
What did you just see?

541
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,730
These two look alike

542
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,030
but I can't decide which one

543
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,620
This one

544
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,130
You see

545
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,990
We are looking at each other in the eyes

546
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,560
How pretty

547
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,180
You look better in this one

548
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,400
This one is good

549
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,320
Look at you

550
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,960
I think we've made the choice

551
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,810
All of these look nice

552
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,240
Right?

553
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,200
Zhen Nian

554
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,110
Don't you think

555
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,720
the wedding dresses here look pretty?

556
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,220
I'm coming

557
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,070
Xingchen

558
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,100
How is this?

559
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,090
Xingchen

560
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,390
You are so gorgeous in the wedding dress

561
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,780
I can't find another word to describe you

562
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,700
I've heard it's hard to hire

563
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,250
the Italian designer

564
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,240
Aunt Ye must have made great efforts

565
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,870
to make this dress

566
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,150
But it's too tight

567
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,440
I can't breathe

568
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,400
It's OK

569
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,650
You look really pretty in it

570
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,560
It should be a sweet burden

571
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,060
I don't know when I can put on a wedding dress

572
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,550
Today is the day

573
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,270
You two go and get dressed

574
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,790
Let's go!

575
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,580
Is that proper?

576
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,990
Yes, let's go

577
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,300
Let's go and try them on

578
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,300
Go

579
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,090
You are here

580
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:21,980
I'm coming

581
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,260
Darling

582
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,230
You look so beautiful

583
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,900
Mom has a good taste

584
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,120
I like

585
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,180
the dress she picked very much

586
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,040
Mine's better

587
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,440
My bride is the prettiest

588
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,440
You two think I'm invisible, right?

589
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,550
Where is Zhen Nian?

590
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,370
Where is my Niannian?

591
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,590
You're annoying

592
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,670
Our Niannian

593
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,950
Mr. Zhao's Niannian, please come out

594
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,730
Don't stop me

595
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,950
Don't stop me

596
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:02,880
I'm not touching him

597
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,010
I'm not

598
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,690
Our Niannian is too beautiful

599
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,880
Too beautiful. I'm not stopping you

600
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,300
Our Tong Xin is pretty too

601
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,220
Thank you, Mr. Yan

602
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,180
Thank you, Xingchen

603
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,310
Pretty. Xingchen is the prettiest

604
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,660
It feels so wonderful

605
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,100
to put on a wedding dress

606
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,030
Do you think so?

607
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,260
I wore it once on the set

608
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,090
so I don't feel much

609
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,100
Let's take a picture together

610
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,520
Okay! Come on!

611
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,120
You take for us

612
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,030
OK

613
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,260
Move

614
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,500
Let me help you

615
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:32,820
Come on

616
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,380
Come on

617
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,590
Please take a good one

618
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,440
Three, two, one

619
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:38,900
Wait

620
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:39,840
Ready

621
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,180
Three, two, one

622
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,300
I wanna one too

623
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:49,990
Come on

624
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,290
Three, two, one

625
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,960
Nice

626
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,050
Me too

627
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:56,790
Come on!

628
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,520
Get ready

629
00:38:58,970 --> 00:38:59,270
Come on

630
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,860
Three, two, one

631
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,530
Cheese

632
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,760
Perfect

633
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,070
Have a look

634
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:05,710
Come on

635
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,950
One more

636
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,280
Three, two, one

637
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,690
Why is he crying?

638
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,780
He hates to let her go,

639
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:28,970
so he's crying

640
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,430
No

641
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:33,390
It's because the love of boss and Xingchen is so moving

642
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,640
It so touching

643
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,270
Don't you think so?

644
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,580
Alright

645
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,890
Which one of the four girls

646
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,900
do you think is the prettiest?

647
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,790
Tong Xin

648
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,470
Yes, she is

649
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,810
But don't you think

650
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,460
my Zhen Nian stands out?

651
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,680
Tong Xin is the most outstanding one

652
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,910
She is

653
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,070
but don't you think my Niannian

654
00:39:59,130 --> 00:39:59,790
looks so charming today?

655
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,080
Yes

656
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,120
Tong Xin is the most charming one

657
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,280
Do you have a power bank with you?

658
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,180
Borrow it to me

659
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,070
No way

660
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:17,390
Darlings

661
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,380
I'm telling you,

662
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,960
you hold up your tears later

663
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,510
You have to control your emotions

664
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,910
We need to take pictures later

665
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,690
Don't you hear me?

666
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
Ailu

667
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,850
I can't help it

668
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,020
I wanna cry right now

669
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,810
What are you crying for?

670
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,920
I've done 20 wedding scenes

671
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,370
Don't cry

672
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,180
It's so shameful

673
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,540
No, that's not what I'm talking about

674
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,710
I mean

675
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,220
don't you think Dr. Han

676
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,970
is so handsome today

677
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,020
Don't you think so?

678
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,480
Anyway, Zhao Yuanfang is the ugliest

679
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,410
Sorry

680
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,110
Sorry to interrupt

681
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,320
What's the name of the crying boy?

682
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,540
Sun Yang

683
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,240
Solo? !

684
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,140
Mr. Yan. Mr. Yan. Mr. Yan

685
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,210
Mr. Yan

686
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,730
Finish the process

687
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,520
as soon as possible

688
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,970
no matter what method you use

689
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,640
I'm gonna go on the honeymoon and get ready for pregnancy

690
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,490
Mr. Yan

691
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,430
I understand your feelings

692
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,080
But it is a matter of life

693
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,720
we can't just cut the necessary process out

694
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,100
Where did you find the wedding MC?

695
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,350
He gets 20 pages of the process

696
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,860
Even so, you can't throw the 20 pages

697
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,850
on his face

698
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,280
You also used your hands

699
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,570
to check the quality of his clothes

700
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,370
You tore his clothes

701
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:34,960
He was too slow

702
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,320
I may not finish the wedding next year

703
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,460
Mr. Yan

704
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,110
I don't care

705
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,400
You have to finish the wedding

706
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:39,930
as soon as possible, OK?

707
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,890
Otherwise you may lose your job

708
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:54,830
Ms. Ye

709
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,380
Are you available tomorrow?

710
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,680
What do you

711
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,410
want from me?

712
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,150
Can you make Xingchen back to Jinghai?

713
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,270
Bros

714
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,950
Are you ready?

715
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,310
Your wife just lives opposite

716
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,870
Why are we so early?

717
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,700
Do you still want your year-end bonus

718
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,460
and that of your girlfriends?

719
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:44,990
Let's go

720
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:46,910
Go, go, go

721
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,050
Let's take pictures

722
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,340
Come on

723
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,360
One, two, three

724
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,340
Great

725
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,530
Good day, Mr. Yan

726
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,720
Please, move

727
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:14,750
Bros

728
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,420
How long will it take to break the door?

729
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,810
From the anatomical viewpoint

730
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,880
You need...

731
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,160
Useless

732
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,740
Zhao Yuanfang, your turn

733
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,620
I've made plans with Zhen Nian

734
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,950
She will open the door in a moment

735
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:28,560
Good buddy

736
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,180
What happened?

737
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,490
I haven't say yes. You stay back

738
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,280
Where the red envelopes?

739
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,200
Red envelopes. Here you are

740
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,120
Red envelopes

741
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,500
Red envelopes

742
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,390
Take them away

743
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:44,870
Open the door

744
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,580
Give a like to your beauty and wisdom

745
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,180
How can you do this?

746
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:53,960
He used his fingerprint

747
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,670
Zhao Yuanfang, go

748
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,260
Honey, let's move

749
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,650
I can't let you in

750
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,270
Sun Yang

751
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,170
Do you wanna your girlfriend?

752
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:04,700
Yes

753
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,470
I'm coming

754
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:06,740
Who are you?

755
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,620
Go away

756
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,670
Xingxing, come on

757
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,630
Why can't I open this door?

758
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,890
There are five red lines

759
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,180
Only when you pick the one held by the bride

760
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:21,920
can you get in

761
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,160
If you pick the wrong one

762
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,540
you'll be punished

763
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,470
Piece of cake

764
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,140
Do you have confidence, bros?

765
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,950
Be serious

766
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:33,980
Do you have confidence?

767
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,700
Yes

768
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:38,860
Yes

769
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,620
We can make it

770
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:43,910
Do you have confidence?

771
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,360
Yes

772
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,160
Sorry

773
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,260
One, two, three, four, go

774
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,140
There is only one left. So it is the one

775
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,420
Are you messing with me?

776
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,200
Are you?

777
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:07,380
Darling

778
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:08,680
Sorry to have kept you waiting

779
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:09,850
I'm late

780
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:11,920
Get down on your knees

781
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:15,690
Get up

782
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,110
Did you do it right?

783
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,850
Darling

784
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,110
Leave with me

785
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,210
Wait

786
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,720
They told me

787
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,060
there is one mission left

788
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,860
Just bring it on

789
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:28,960
I'm marrying me no matter what

790
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,440
Only one of this tied onto my shoe

791
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,620
Honey, you've changed

792
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:37,360
Are you marrying me or not?

793
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:37,900
Yes

794
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,050
Bros

795
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:40,910
Here

796
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,110
Do you have confidence?

797
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,660
Come back
