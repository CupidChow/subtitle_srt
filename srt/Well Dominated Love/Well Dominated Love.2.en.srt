1
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,300
Perfectionism

2
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,470
Pursue perfection excessively

3
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,700
Excessive demands on work

4
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,100
No fun in life

5
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,000
Rigid character

6
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,120
Stubborn

7
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,170
What the stuff?

8
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,850
Hello

9
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,970
Hello

10
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,120
Your majesty, Mr. Yan

11
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,970
It's one o'clock midnight

12
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,020
Mr. Han

13
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,520
Do you think I have obsessive-compulsive disorder?

14
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,020
What?

15
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,220
Do you think I

16
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,550
pursue perfection excessively

17
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,300
and I am strict with work?

18
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,920
No fun in life?

19
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,700
Wait a minute

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,820
What happened to you?

21
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,100
Don't you sleep before eleven

22
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,270
every day

23
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,550
Do you think I am

24
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,900
rigid and stubborn,

25
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,400
don’t you?

26
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,150
Why don't you come to the hospital for a brain test?

27
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,370
I think you seem a little out of order

28
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,220
I will come tomorrow

29
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,500
Hello, Mr. Yan

30
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,450
Secretary Nie

31
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,220
Where are you?

32
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,020
Is there anything wrong, Mr. Yan?

33
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,250
You are late

34
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,600
Mr. Yan

35
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,550
It is weekend

36
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,470
As my chief secretary,

37
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,520
all your time is mine

38
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,420
On Monday, I will go to the company to go through the resignation procedures

39
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,470
I hope Mr. Yan

40
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,950
won't disturb my private time any more

41
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,070
Secretary Nie

42
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,650
Are you sure

43
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,850
Mr. Yan

44
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,900
What did you say?

45
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,770
I can't hear you clearly

46
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,140
Hello, hello?

47
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,370
Mr. Yan

48
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,250
Secretary Nie, you…

49
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,620
Director Huang

50
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,070
I won't go to the company today

51
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,900
You put the documents on my desk

52
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,270
Send it to the address I sent you before

53
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,200
Have you listened to the song

54
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,470
he shared yesterday?

55
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,070
Of Course we have!

56
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,550
It is too late

57
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,780
Take a picture

58
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,670
Hello

59
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,450
Director Huang

60
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,300
What?

61
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,100
Send documents

62
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,500
But...

63
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,320
It is weekend

64
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,600
I haven't seen my honey yet

65
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,950
Alright

66
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,350
I see

67
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:49,750
Bye-bye

68
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,870
My J

69
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,050
How do you feel?

70
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,820
Do you feel headache or dizziness?

71
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,250
Sorry!

72
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,400
The things I tramped,

73
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,970
if it's required,

74
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,050
I can pay

75
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,050
But

76
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,700
In reality, does the

77
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,900
handsome and gentle doctor exist?

78
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,920
If you have any symptoms afterwards,

79
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,470
please be sure to come to the hospital

80
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,700
to take a film and check it out

81
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,950
Doctor

82
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,670
I

83
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,020
I can't move my leg

84
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,470
Can you give me a hand?

85
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,520
Just give me a hand

86
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,100
Secretary Tong

87
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,970
Boss

88
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,800
Boss

89
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,500
You can go!

90
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,770
Women

91
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,970
are the most terrible and difficult to understand creatures

92
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,150
in the world

93
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,750
According to my diagnosis,

94
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,470
you're a misogynist

95
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,370
I know an American psychologist

96
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:03,920
Thank you

97
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,070
By contrast,

98
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,600
I am more interested in studying your amnesia

99
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,300
You are a doctor,

100
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,670
but you don’t wipe my hands after washing!

101
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,670
Judging from your film

102
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,920
intracranial

103
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,350
and any organic disease are not found in your brain

104
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,050
Your examination results

105
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,200
is exactly the same as it was five years ago

106
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,500
There are no exceptions

107
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,570
Your judgment is wrong

108
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,950
After I returned home,

109
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,900
my head began to ache

110
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,700
I am your attending doctor

111
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,450
Are you sure you want to query my professionalism?

112
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,800
There will be progress only if there are doubts

113
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,620
There are many reasons for headache

114
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,170
According to your situation, there

115
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,100
stands a possibility

116
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,100
It's probably mental stimulation

117
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,720
caused by cerebral vasospasm

118
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,570
But...

119
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,700
Don't talk about those theories

120
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,720
Go straight to the point

121
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,170
The point is

122
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,850
when was your first headache, and

123
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,150
with whom?

124
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,670
Rosemary

125
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,370
Mr. Yan

126
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,670
I'm sorry I lost my temper

127
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,420
Have we met before?

128
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,420
After returning home, I met a person

129
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,850
who gave me a very familiar feeling

130
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,820
Whenever I want to recall something,

131
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:18,950
I got the headache

132
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,670
I suggest

133
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,600
you can make more contact with her

134
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,950
to stimulate your brain nerves

135
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
But don't force yourself to recall

136
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600
If she is willing to accept it,

137
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,050
it is very effective for your memory recovery

138
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,270
What's wrong?

139
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,970
Did she refuse you?

140
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,400
Is there anyone Mr. Yan can't handle with?

141
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,350
I heard aunt will arrange a blind date for you

142
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,750
Here

143
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,020
is a very suitable list available

144
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,850
Let's take a look at this film

145
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,370
I think the shadow of this place

146
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,400
An operation should be performed to

147
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,050
remove it

148
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,270
What do you think?

149
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,350
What do you think?

150
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,000
Such a gentle

151
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,550
and handsome doctor

152
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,850
How come there is no fan?

153
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,200
From today on,

154
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,250
I am the president of your fan club today on,

155
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,070
Miss

156
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,800
Do you know doctor Han Ziyu?

157
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,450
Yes!

158
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,400
When did he come?

159
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,200
Nie Xingchen

160
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,500
You scared me! You…

161
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,270
What are you doing here?

162
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,070
Fear and

163
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,900
Guilty!

164
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,870
It's such a big deal to see a house and buy it

165
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,600
You don't even to ask me to be your company

166
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,600
I’m so disappointed at you!

167
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,070
So disappointing!

168
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,270
I'm looking at small apartments here

169
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,550
You live in a mansion

170
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,370
I asked you to have a look

171
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,520
Can I buy that apartment I like?

172
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,700
Actually, I don't approve of you buying that one

173
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,120
Think about it! You've saved money for so many years,

174
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,300
but only to pay a down payment,

175
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,120
and there is still loan you need to pay off

176
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,000
It seems that you are suffering losses!

177
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,700
Women should learn how to invest in themselves!

178
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,650
Shoes,

179
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,170
bags,

180
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:02,750
clothes and

181
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,370
makeups

182
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,070
you need just buy all of them

183
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,600
What do you need the apartment for?

184
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,000
It's the man who buy the apartment!

185
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:07,950
Miss Nie

186
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,350
The apartment you like

187
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,950
is already the lowest price

188
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,470
Or you can look at

189
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,170
other properties of our Bojue

190
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,400
Thank you

191
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,550
Then I'll think about it again

192
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,320
OK

193
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,750
What's your name?

194
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,870
Xu Qianwen

195
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,970
Do you really like this apartment?

196
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,350
How much is the difference from quoting price?

197
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,320
I’ll fully support you!

198
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,200
Don't try to get involved in my house matter!

199
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,300
Let me have a look at the others

200
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,520
What's the rush?

201
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,120
I haven't played my part yet

202
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,150
Zhao Yuanfang

203
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,150
Xu Qianwen

204
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,000
You said the first phase of the house sold well

205
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,700
Where is it?

206
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,620
Don’t be fooling around!

207
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,500
Is this one?

208
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,970
Yes, here!

209
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,520
Then we’re going to

210
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,900
build some business districts,

211
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,000
and schools and others

212
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,720
Xu Qianwen

213
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,650
How do you know my name?

214
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,000
I just saw it

215
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,150
That's my sister

216
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,500
I brought her to see the house today

217
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,100
She likes this one

218
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,370
But I said it...

219
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,770
Can I add your WeChat

220
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,350
Miss Qianwen

221
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,570
Do you know a lot of inside information, don’t you?

222
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,770
It depends on what you want to know

223
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,620
We'll talk later

224
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,100
OK

225
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,270
How?

226
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,850
Do you want a promotion price?

227
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,550
Of course!

228
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,970
Do you want a discount?

229
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,170
Absolutely!

230
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,720
Get ready for a date!

231
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,000
Can you just be a normal people?

232
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,770
I’m not saying I want to date with you

233
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:58,950
Such a self-sentimental lady!

234
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,520
Don’t you say?

235
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Yes

236
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,770
The inside information

237
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,400
Bojue Group will launch a batch of products next month

238
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,720
staff welfare apartments

239
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,350
No one else knows

240
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,620
You haven't quit yet, have you?

241
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:20,800
Get ready for a date!

242
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,450
Xu Qianwen

243
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,150
Qianwen

244
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,270
Good name!

245
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,620
Good morning! Mr. Yan

246
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,000
Secretary Nie

247
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,470
If I remember correctly,

248
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,850
you have resigned now

249
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,000
And you are not my secretary anymore

250
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,300
This behavior of yours is called breaking into people's homes

251
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,250
According to company regulations,

252
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,970
it will take a month for those who leave their jobs

253
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,170
to hand over work

254
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,470
So strictly speaking

255
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,700
I am still your chief secretary

256
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,370
It's time for breakfast

257
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,250
I have no appetite

258
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,600
Mr. Yan, you…

259
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,870
I have nothing to say to you

260
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,700
You can go out now

261
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,220
I just want to remind you

262
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,720
The buttons are wrong

263
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,450
Secretary Nie

264
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,920
My speech...

265
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,200
I think I left it in the company computer

266
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,650
It is traffic jam time now

267
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,970
It may take two hours to go back and forth

268
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,320
Then I will try my best to get here before you speak

269
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,650
Thanks for your efforts!

270
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,770
But if you don't stop work at the weekend

271
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,050
This trip should not be necessary

272
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,920
It’s all about my job dereliction of duty

273
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,270
I’m sorry for your inconvenience

274
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,500
There will be no next!

275
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,670
I’m waiting for you

276
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,100
Mr. Yan

277
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,700
S... speech!

278
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,720
You came in time

279
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,000
I just remembered

280
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,020
There seems to be a backup in my mobile phone

281
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,220
Thanks for your efforts!

282
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,450
Backup...

283
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,850
Backup

284
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,620
Mr. Yan

285
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,310
Secretary Nie

286
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,400
Help me prepare lunch

287
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,150
Okay

288
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,300
What would you like for lunch?

289
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,970
I want to eat this, this and this

290
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,970
Your three stores span three districts

291
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,900
Any problem?

292
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,570
No

293
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,050
Mr. Yan

294
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,800
All the meals you ordered have been bought for you

295
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,220
Please enjoy

296
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,020
I still have a meeting

297
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:45,850
I may not be able to eat

298
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,070
Secretary Nie

299
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,500
You look a little tired

300
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,850
Refresh yourself with this

301
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,850
You are welcome!

302
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,850
Do you have any ideas about the plan for the new project?

303
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,770
I think the wedding dress tour is good

304
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,050
Why do you say that?

305
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,150
Situation

306
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,920
The selling point of wedding photos is the situation and experience

307
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,850
This combination of travel records,

308
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,770
freedom and romance

309
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,750
And you can shoot wherever you want

310
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,320
This kind of personal tailored Travel Photography Mode

311
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,200
currently needed in the market

312
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,150
You are in charge of this project

313
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,800
Send me the project plan as soon as possible

314
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,050
All right, Mr. Yan

315
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,100
By the way

316
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,300
We’ll postponed the meeting that was

317
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,000
with overseas headquarters originally scheduled for tomorrow night

318
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,050
to the day after tomorrow

319
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,120
Exactly

320
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,620
Book me two tickets for the Clayderman concert

321
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,500
I need to adjust my mood

322
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,750
Tickets for tomorrow night are already sold out

323
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,820
This is the problem you need to solve

324
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,220
Hello, Yingying

325
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,320
I would like to ask

326
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,250
Can you get me that

327
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,450
Tickets for Richard Clayderman's concert

328
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,020
Hello, Director Zhongying

329
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,950
No! No! No!

330
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,300
I don't want to make a movie

331
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,650
You are filming, aren't you?

332
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,420
I’m so sorry

333
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,300
Senior sister

334
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,150
I would like to ask

335
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,190
The one who helped us buy concert tickets last time

336
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,970
Your boyfriend

337
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,520
Broke up?

338
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,800
Hello, Xia Ling

339
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,770
I would like to ask

340
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,970
Do you have any friends who can...

341
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,600
Hello?

342
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,670
Mr. Yan

343
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,400
It’s sold out, isn’t it?

344
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,450
It happens to

345
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,450
my college classmate's

346
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,520
boyfriend's elder sister’s company

347
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,620
is the organizer of this concert

348
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,050
I'll watch it alone

349
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,350
What is the average daily per capita flow?

350
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,650
Last quarter it averaged…

351
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,500
What I want is accurate data

352
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,750
Not archaeology

353
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,770
Sorry, sir

354
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,020
I go back to statistics immediately

355
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,950
Are there accurate data reports of

356
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,420
Rent-to-Sale Ratio and Contribution Rate of Merchants

357
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,300
Investment promotion departments reflect the low occupancy rate

358
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,700
Shops change frequently

359
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,970
The summary report for this month has not been released yet

360
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,170
So

361
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,900
Can anyone tell me

362
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,670
the problems in this shopping mall

363
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,870
Mr. Yan

364
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,180
Not only Bojue

365
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,020
All shopping malls owned by

366
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,350
Bojue faced with

367
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,170
such a problem

368
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,520
Because the e-commerce industry has risen rapidly

369
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,170
Customers prefer to buy things online

370
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,470
Therefore, I think that giving full play to the advantages of physical sales

371
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,000
to improve customer satisfaction rate

372
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,220
This is the most important issue at this stage

373
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,700
Aren't you a short video platform

374
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,000
How do you know so much about Bojue's stores?

375
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,870
When I was shopping before, I heard the merchants mention it

376
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,000
After admitting the group,

377
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,720
I checked with the investment promotion department

378
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,300
I did a little work on it

379
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,120
Good job!

380
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,270
Since you raised the question,

381
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,200
Then the President Office will work out a rectification plan

382
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,000
Don't just stand there, please help

383
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,620
I'm really sorry, Mr. Yan

384
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,170
This kind of trifle requires you to do by yourself

385
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,500
I must get the rectification plan tonight

386
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,600
Please get it definitely completed

387
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,070
Oh, God!

388
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,100
I have to work overtime again today

389
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,770
Then I will

390
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,970
not be able to watch the live broadcast of J

391
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,570
The boss recently

392
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,220
is a little bit badly tempered

393
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,870
I have to get him some tea

394
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,100
to him for body conditioning

395
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,070
Body conditioning

396
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,120
Why is it broken?

397
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,170
Buy a new one

398
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,250
Beautiful

399
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,620
I'm so sorry!

400
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,770
I didn't pick it up

401
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,220
Miss Xingchen

402
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,670
The boss's car abroad has been transported back to China

403
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,770
This is the plate number he chose

404
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,000
OK

405
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,120
Wait a minute, Tong Xin

406
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,350
Have Mr. Yan ever said

407
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,500
why did he choose this?

408
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,900
No…

409
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,970
0521

410
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,120
Is it Mr. Yan's birthday?

411
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,820
Yan's birthday is October 9

412
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,320
Not his birthday

413
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,300
Maybe it's some kind of anniversary

414
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,500
I don’t care about what anniversary it is

415
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,050
My eyes are more tired than that I’m playing games

416
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,820
Do any of you have eye drops?

417
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,470
Can I borrow it?

418
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,700
Ailu

419
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,970
You haven't given my charging line back yet

420
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,320
Director Huang

421
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,020
Look, my nails are all broken

422
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,170
This is a work injury

423
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:09,820
You have to compensate

424
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,420
Director Huang

425
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,100
My head is a little dizzy, too

426
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,570
Dizziness？

427
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,520
Sun Yang

428
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,340
If you have a problem with your head,

429
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,600
please go to see a doctor immediately

430
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,520
I know a very good brain doctor

431
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,000
The best and youngest chief physician

432
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,970
Why don't you all group together

433
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,270
to check your brain

434
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,650
I am responsible for queuing up for registration

435
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,320
You give yourself a number first

436
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,170
Come here

437
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:40,850
Director Huang

438
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,820
Are there any instructions?

439
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,300
You don’t recommend idols now

440
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,920
but doctors

441
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,250
No

442
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,370
J is

443
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,620
the idol on the screen

444
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,320
The doctor is real

445
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,170
Director Huang, who is not in conflict with the two

446
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,650
I don't care if you are J or K

447
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,150
Do you want to be an intern all your life?

448
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,850
Has the work been completed?

449
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,870
What qualifications do you have to see a doctor?

450
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,050
No

451
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,050
Look at Secretary Nie

452
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,650
Look at Secretary Nie

453
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,150
The example lies ahead

454
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,050
Every day under the psychological and spiritual

455
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:18,870
huge pressure

456
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,870
Has she complained

457
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,750
No

458
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,070
What spirit is this?

459
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,920
This is the spirit of ostrich

460
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,820
Bury one's head in the soil

461
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,720
despite the storm outside

462
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,350
You don't just nod

463
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,550
You keep it in mind

464
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,120
Every day with big boss

465
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,220
I would also like to…

466
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,920
Sorry, everyone

467
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,520
I steamrolled you all

468
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,470
Let's see

469
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,600
I'll treat you to hot pot after I finish my work

470
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,170
What to do?

471
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,650
Hot pot

472
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:16,470
Hello

473
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,420
Secretary Nie

474
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,800
Where are you?

475
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,800
I am having hot pot with my colleagues

476
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,920
I want the national UAV management

477
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:24,900
laws and regulations

478
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,320
That's in my computer

479
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,350
Then I'll go back now

480
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,570
No

481
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,020
I want it now

482
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,950
Tell me your computer password

483
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,420
Secretary Nie

484
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,420
0521

485
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,850
I see

486
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,820
Let's have a big adventure

487
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,300
Everyone complained about the boss

488
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:17,920
Dare you not?

489
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,030
Okay, okay!

490
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,020
Then I'll come first

491
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,200
He is

492
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,150
too narcissistic

493
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,100
He always use his own standards to ask others

494
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,220
if everyone is like him

495
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,600
The world will come to end

496
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,170
Facial paralysis

497
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,350
But what if he marries me,

498
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,420
I will also say yes

499
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,420
For me,

500
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,170
he is a workaholic

501
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,570
We should let him every day

502
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,320
make plans and presentations

503
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,600
Let him feel the sufferings of the world

504
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,200
Yes, yes

505
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,150
Alright, alright

506
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,550
You're all crazy, right?

507
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,020
You’re unscrupulous out of the office, aren't you?

508
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,120
Er...

509
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,000
But what do you want to say

510
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,050
I think

511
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,420
it would better if our boss

512
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,320
has more humanistic feelings

513
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,500
Let me tell you something

514
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,450
He is mean-looking

515
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,250
Every time I see him, I feel especially nervous

516
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,870
So I admire Xingchen especially

517
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,450
Secretary Nie

518
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,350
What do you think?

519
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,600
I think he is ...

520
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,920
Mr. Yan!

521
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,220
Ya...Yan...

522
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,450
Why are you here?

523
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,500
Dinner

524
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,770
Mr. Yan. Please

525
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,770
It's not time for work now

526
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,970
Our boss will keep it separate from work

527
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,270
Help yourself, guys

528
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,830
Yes, yes

529
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,420
Feel free. Be free

530
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,270
Sit down, sit sit!

531
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,200
Eat

532
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,420
Food materials into the pot

533
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,400
All right

534
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,720
Come on

535
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,650
Coriander is delicious

536
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,550
Please don't

537
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,220
What's wrong?

538
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,100
Someone might dislike it

539
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,970
No

540
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,200
But we are all like it

541
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,340
We like it so much

542
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,460
I don't like it

543
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,470
I...

544
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,720
I don't like it, either

545
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,400
Usually, we don't cook coriander

546
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,270
We eat fresh coriander

547
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,700
Don't you...don't you like it?

548
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,650
Yeah, yeah, we like it

549
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,120
Director Huang

550
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,400
Have more

551
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,720
Still a lot more

552
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,050
So tasty

553
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,170
Refreshing the spirit. More ingredient please

554
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,670
Come on

555
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,470
Hurry up

556
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,170
Hold on!

557
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,320
Separately

558
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,500
It allows to keep time precisely

559
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,320
So when will we finish then?

560
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,170
Nevermind

561
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,250
I get an idea

562
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,420
Mr. Yan

563
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,620
Don't you think...

564
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,620
Can you give me an explanation for the computer password

565
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,410
I changed it

566
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,700
cause I need to memorize your license plate number

567
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,000
I want the truth

568
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:22,900
Hello

569
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,320
My party just ended,

570
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,750
can I pick you up?

571
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,700
Alright

572
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,470
I'll be waiting

573
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,720
You want the truth?

574
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,650
Sure

575
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,600
521

576
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,550
That was the anniversary of my acquaintance with my boyfriend

577
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,070
As far as I know,

578
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,370
you don't have boyfriend

579
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,100
That's my private business,

580
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,550
so there's no need to bother you

581
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,820
Bill please

582
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,420
I will check out. Come on

583
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,000
No no no

584
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,870
It's my turn, we said before

585
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,650
Swiping my card please

586
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:03,970
Hello

587
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,800
RMB 728 Yuan in all

588
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:06,970
Mr. Yan

589
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:07,670
It's my treat

590
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,050
Wait a moment

591
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,050
It's Monday today

592
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,720
This card is 30% off at here

593
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,450
so that's RMB 509.6 Yuan

594
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
And I have four coupons

595
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,220
minus 400 yuan then

596
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,400
Finally, RMB 109.6 Yuan

597
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:23,950
Right?

598
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,520
Good, Xingchen. You are brilliant!

599
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,600
I wanna learn from you how to save money

600
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,550
With your brain, never

601
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,250
Your card please, Miss

602
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,270
We owe Xingchen again,are we?

603
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,700
I can't grab the bill

604
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,850
You say that every time

605
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,550
Mr. Zhao!

606
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,970
Thank you guys

607
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,570
for taking care of my Xingchen

608
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,800
It's too late today

609
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,870
I'll treat next time

610
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,950
Are you managing your former secretary?

611
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,020
Or...

612
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,100
You two have another relationship

613
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,150
Mr. Yan

614
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,150
I think I have no need to tell you

615
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,850
No time like the present

616
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,950
See you tomorrow

617
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,220
Sorry

618
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,170
I have dated Xingchen tomorrow

619
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,300
Next time

620
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,420
Zhao might be Xingchen's boyfriend

621
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,500
Or her admirer

622
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,370
Yeah, definitely

623
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,120
Secret admirer. Secret admirer

624
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,120
Go home now

625
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,270
Would you like to be late tomorrow?

626
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,180
Goodbye, Yan

627
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,200
Byebye, see you, Yan

628
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,250
Huang Tao

629
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,420
Tomorrow

630
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,270
We'll have a team building activity for the President Office

631
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,150
No one can be absent

632
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,720
Surprise!

633
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,750
Can you arrange it?

634
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,650
Yes, I can

635
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,520
I believe in you

636
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,900
Me?

637
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,270
Our boss is very humane actually

638
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,220
Take back what I said

639
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,670
Morning. Morning. Morning

640
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,170
Hurry up

641
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:09,770
Slow down

642
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,420
Did you bring any food?

643
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,750
Why you trip with high heels

644
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,700
No food

645
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:17,450
Good morning

646
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,750
Xin Tong. Xin Tong. Xin Tong

647
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,300
Xingchen...Er...Mr. Yan

648
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,270
Isn't a team building for the whole company today?

649
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,620
Why are there only colleagues in president's office

650
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,320
Yeah

651
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,850
Only our department team building today

652
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,400
Do you feel a pity?

653
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,750
Zhao is not here

654
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,570
Move

655
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,720
I brought you breakfast, Boss

656
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,220
Have a seat

657
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,120
Miss Xingchen

658
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,100
It's fine

659
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,050
We go with you

660
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,000
OK

661
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,600
Don't play with that

662
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,750
You would borrow my power bank again later

663
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,600
I'll play for a while

664
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,270
How boring

665
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,770
Let's listen to J's new song

666
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,470
Hey hey hey, move

667
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,320
Guys

668
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,920
Everyone, please listen to me

669
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,250
Previously

670
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,370
Everyone did a good job

671
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,320
In order to make up for you guys

672
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,120
Mr. Yan

673
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,900
prepared

674
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,520
coupons in our company's mall

675
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,420
as benefits for you

676
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,720
Hold on. Hold on

677
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,720
Due to the limited number

678
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,400
We can only through the game

679
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,950
"complete"

680
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,770
"compete"

681
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,750
You know it

682
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,600
"Coubon"is the key

683
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,320
"Coupon"

684
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,170
All right, all right

685
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,920
In pairs

686
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:48,570
Feel free to mix and match

687
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,170
Is that OK?

688
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,570
Xingchen.

689
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,250
Secretary Nie

690
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,770
You can come with me

691
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,300
Mr. Yan

692
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,170
Actually I didn't plan to participate in the game

693
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,170
If we win,

694
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,120
I provide you a day off with pay

695
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,800
I am not very good at it. Two days

696
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,600
Two days

697
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,120
What about two days

698
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,220
Come on. Join us

699
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah, come on

700
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:17,770
Okay Okay

701
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,500
Then we two in pairs

702
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,520
Well done

703
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:20,870
Come on

704
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,370
Get ready

705
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,700
I'll make the question

706
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,570
I'll keep the time

707
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,720
How many words?How many words

708
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,950
Four words

709
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,870
Laugh laugh

710
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,050
Laugh Into The Air

711
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:30,970
No

712
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,020
See

713
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,570
Roll In The Aisles

714
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,220
Time, Time, Time

715
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,820
You... You...You...

716
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,100
Laugh Your Head Off

717
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,420
Time is up

718
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,470
You laugh your head off

719
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,300
Correct? Time is up

720
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,750
You should act it

721
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,150
Totally wrong!

722
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,070
Entirely wrong

723
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,670
All right, all right

724
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,170
No tacit

725
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,600
Although we know each other for these years

726
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,500
Stop

727
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,870
Now, let's welcome Yan

728
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,220
and Secretary Nie

729
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,550
Alright, get ready

730
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,850
You ready?

731
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:06,800
OK

732
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,470
You ready?

733
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,070
Question one

734
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,750
Ready? Here we go

735
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,150
Four words

736
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,570
How do you feel

737
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,700
when you see something very messy

738
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,850
Feel uneasy

739
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,130
So fast

740
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,400
Very quick

741
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,200
Next question

742
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,200
What's your favorite sport

743
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:25,870
Boxing

744
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,100
Question three

745
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,370
Three words

746
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,970
And the first two words are repeated

747
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,050
It's where you are most afraid of touching

748
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,270
Five, four

749
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,150
Tickle spot

750
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,750
What! Why

751
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,450
Too tacit! My god

752
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,770
It's too tacit

753
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,700
It... Stop it

754
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,720
I quit

755
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,720
It's funny

756
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,000
Look

757
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,820
How can Xingchen know that boss is afraid of itching?

758
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,470
Did she...

759
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:19,850
No way!

760
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,440
Hush

761
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:20,920
Possibly

762
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,450
It's reasonable

763
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,450
cuz She is responsible for boss's diet

764
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,120
Why are you so excited?

765
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,450
According to my experience for these years

766
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,550
Secretary Nie

767
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,300
Secretary Nie and Zhao

768
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,920
is couple actually

769
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,370
Why do you know me so much

770
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,920
and I feel a bit familiar with you

771
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,120
It's an internal team building activity of PO

772
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,020
Why are you here

773
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,720
Certainly, I came as a family member of PO’s staff

774
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,450
Team building for PO only?

775
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,150
Not including us?

776
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,550
Do you know the location?

777
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,470
Mr. Yan, please show your respect

778
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,200
Mr. Yan

779
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,070
Only eight people can play this game

780
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,170
We get seven

781
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,520
Mr. Zhao

782
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,470
Zhao! You are here

783
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,220
Please leave me gracefully

784
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,120
Alright

785
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,770
Let's choose identity now

786
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,550
Secretary Nie, please

787
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,270
I choose Mercenary

788
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,050
So am I

789
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,150
Then I change to another

790
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:12,970
No way

791
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,500
So many familiar colleagues of you here

792
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,700
Why Xingchen

793
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,270
Why you choose MY secretary

794
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,300
Both of you, please

795
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,400
I have a suggestion

796
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,220
Since both of you have chosen Secretary Nie

797
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,070
You decide

798
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,220
Secretary Nie

799
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,450
Good idea

800
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:38,800
Secretary Nie

801
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,620
Don't forget who you are, Nie

802
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,150
Xingchen

803
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,100
We have been working together for five years, Xingchen

804
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,070
You can't abandon me at this time

805
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,770
I choose Zhao

806
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,400
Mr. Yan

807
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,620
I have studied

808
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,550
the role of Pharmacist in depth

809
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:04,720
So I...

810
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,600
I pick you

811
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,650
Stop it

812
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,550
OK

813
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,250
What are they...

814
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,300
It's quite important as well to note that

815
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,420
two Undercovers are in this game

816
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,270
Then

817
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,000
we have to discover and out them

818
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,450
to win the game

819
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,300
Alright

820
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,870
Any questions?

821
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,150
Nope. No. Good

822
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,300
Changing clothes then

823
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,850
OK

824
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,520
Go. Go

825
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,970
Let's find Secretary Nie first

826
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,370
Boss

827
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,020
But we have a task this time

828
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,420
Finding Secretary Nie

829
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,600
Boss

830
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,020
Boss

831
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,050
Boss

832
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:49,970
There's a map

833
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,020
B2, Container Area, Meeting Room

834
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:54,920
Boss

835
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:58,670
Boss

836
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,500
Mr. Yan

837
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,950
Why did you come to the armory, Yan?

838
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,700
I want your protection

839
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,220
Damn

840
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:18,850
The virus has spread

841
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:19,300
Run!

842
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,500
Wait! Wait for me

843
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,220
Xingchen

844
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:27,970
Don't be afraid, Xingchen

845
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,050
We have guns

846
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,620
Secretary Nie

847
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,370
Follow me, Nie

848
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,050
Follow me

849
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,800
Quick

850
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,590
Hurry up! Give me the bread

851
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,250
Take your time

852
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:42,740
No

853
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,320
I have to alive

854
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,670
and develop antidote for all of you

855
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,120
Yes, yes

856
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,970
So do I. So do I

857
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,120
I hardly have the physical ability to repair the power system

858
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,200
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

859
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,450
Four coins

860
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,920
Too expensive, cheaper

861
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,350
Yeah

862
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:53,900
Listen to me

863
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:54,770
Six coins

864
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,920
I... How...

865
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,270
How dare you raise the price at the transaction location

866
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,350
Bad guy

867
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,170
Where is Secretary Nie?

868
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,800
Mr. Yan

869
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:04,450
You're freaking me out

870
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,220
She's not at here

871
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,770
Isn't she with Zhao?

872
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,270
Xing...Xingchen?

873
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,150
Isn't she with you?

874
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,920
Our top priority is to find Sun Yang

875
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,550
He has a toolbox

876
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:18,650
for repairing the power supply system

877
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,700
Mr. Yan!

878
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,050
Yan, don't leave me

879
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,370
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

880
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,620
Get away from me! Away! Away!

881
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,700
Miss Xingchen

882
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,170
You saved me, Xingchen

883
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,550
Miss Xingchen

884
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,670
Are you OK?

885
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,370
I'm fine. It's ok

886
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,220
My ankle just sprained

887
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,620
Secretary Nie

888
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,250
What're you doing, Zhao Yuanfang?

889
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,120
Open the door

890
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,820
Gun is great

891
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,820
You're despicable

892
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:24,950
Zhao Yuanfang

893
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,520
Come down here

894
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,270
I gonna kick you up

895
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,550
Mr. Zhao? Mr. Yan?

896
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,400
You...

897
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:35,200
I

898
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,520
Mr. Yan

899
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,020
Where are you going

900
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,700
I just wander around

901
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,470
Shall we have a drink

902
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,720
I buy you this drink

903
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,400
I don't need to buy another one

904
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,800
Secretary Nie

905
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,570
Mr. Yan

906
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
I come first

907
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,070
It seems not appropriate

908
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,200
Why not?

909
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,650
That's hot spring bath, isn't it?

910
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,750
Inappropriate gender

911
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,200
Inappropriate status

912
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:57,470
Inappropriate time as well

913
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,050
I think we are all appropriate

914
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,670
We like same taste

915
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:03,970
same foods

916
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,270
Coincidence happens inadvertently,

917
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:07,500
so does misunderstanding

918
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:08,900
Nie Xingchen

919
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,650
I would like to know...

920
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,450
Did we know each other before?

921
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,650
I said I don’t know

922
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:16,950
No matter how many times you ask me... I...

923
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,550
You know it, do you?

924
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,550
You know who it is

925
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,200
Answer me

926
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:03,320
Boss

927
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,420
I have synthesized a poison

928
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,470
They all end

929
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,020
as long as I tap lightly...

930
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:11,470
Now?

931
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,700
Did you hide intentionally,

932
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,170
so that I can't find you

933
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:19,850
Nice gun

934
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:20,970
Listen, don't to lie to me

935
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,520
I've been with you for so long, I know you

936
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:25,470
No

937
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,070
Why you shoot him?

938
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,800
Why did you shoot?

939
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,750
Huang is your teammate

940
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,170
If I don't,

941
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,600
all of you would die

942
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:42,970
They are undercover

943
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,900
Here we go

944
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:46,800
It turns out that Yan and Huang are undercovers

945
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,300
Boring

946
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:51,620
No

947
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:53,050
Why two Pharmacists are...

948
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,870
Mr. Yan

949
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,050
I don't know, either

950
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:56,450
Both of them are undercovers

951
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,650
They shouldn't be in the same team

952
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:58,800
You guys should appreciate me

953
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,220
Mr. Yan

954
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:01,470
Mr. Yan

955
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:04,900
Why you quit?

956
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:06,320
It's a game

957
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,550
I care more about

958
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:10,950
victory in reality
