1
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,540
Where're my mom and dad?

2
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,290
I already mentioned it just now

3
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,490
I bought them waist supporters

4
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,540
They are upstairs trying them on

5
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,890
The chili is very spicy. They are grown by my dad

6
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,970
You cannot stand it

7
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,290
Uncle said that

8
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,340
I should eat more chili in order to get used to it

9
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,670
Yan Jingzhi

10
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,420
Despite that he has lost that period of memory

11
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,220
He fell in love with you again

12
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,290
You saw us?

13
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,890
Don't fool yourself any more

14
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,040
He is just being impulsive, what about you?!

15
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,490
You have closed your heart for so many years

16
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,690
and only care work but not love

17
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,120
You just cannot let it go, don't you?

18
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,970
It's just a matter of time

19
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,020
How many 5 years are there in life?

20
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,640
If you really cannot move on

21
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,920
Why don't follow your only heart

22
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,320
and try another time?

23
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,420
You know the reason why I refused him

24
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,420
I know but Yan Jingzhi doesn't

25
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,890
If you keep hiding the truth from him

26
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,190
He will keep tangling you

27
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,220
Guilty is something that tortures you

28
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,840
And it will keep consuming your soul

29
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,490
You cannot just ignore it

30
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,440
I know that you are brave

31
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,240
But you cannot turn a one-time fault

32
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,190
into a lifetime one

33
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,490
Don't worry

34
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,320
No matter what

35
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,090
you decide to say

36
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,440
and what the final result it

37
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,880
I will always beside you

38
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,400
Yuanfang

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,190
Feeling that I am way better than Yan Jingzhi?

40
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,840
Stop tangling with him

41
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,220
and come to me for my warm embrace

42
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,720
Zhao Yuanfang

43
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,510
As if you are being serious

44
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,090
I am to come to tears

45
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,890
But honestly

46
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,840
Thank you

47
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,890
You are the most precious friend

48
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,490
of mine for a lifetime

49
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,820
Although

50
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,140
I may not able to feel

51
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,670
what you have suffered 5 years ago

52
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,840
I think

53
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,420
it cannot be more painful than eating the hottest chili

54
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,190
Xingchen

55
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,920
I wish you happiness

56
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,690
OK

57
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,290
I'm leaving

58
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,240
Stay inside

59
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,420
I don't except you to send me downstairs and ...

60
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,290
Nie Xingchen

61
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,570
You do need me to help you in this

62
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,480
Dad

63
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:31,970
Xingxing

64
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,820
Where are they?

65
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,390
They are all gone

66
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,820
You two can sleep upstairs

67
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,640
I will sleep downstairs today

68
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,390
It's fine

69
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,390
Just let your dad stay downstairs

70
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,470
Xingxing

71
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,670
Let me ask you

72
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,420
I feel that both Zhao and Yan

73
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,670
are quite good men

74
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,470
Which one do you prefer?

75
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,720
Mom!

76
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,840
Why are you yelling?

77
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,770
There's no hearing problem with your mom

78
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,190
About Zhao, I think he is very good

79
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,140
in all respect

80
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,840
But about Yan

81
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,990
His job is not as good

82
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,570
and he used to be your assistant

83
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,290
Mom!

84
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,170
Actually he is not my assistant

85
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,590
He is the boss of

86
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,970
the previous company

87
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,290
Mom, what for?

88
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:24,970
I'm your mother

89
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,070
Why not

90
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,390
No wonder I felt so weird

91
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,570
while eating just now

92
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,190
There's nothing weird about it

93
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,720
Actually it's okay

94
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,940
Xingxing already left the company

95
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,090
There won't be chances for them to meet in the future any more

96
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,890
Really?

97
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,520
Time for sleep

98
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,740
Go to bed

99
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,420
Dad, good night

100
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,490
Have you took everything with you?

101
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,120
Don't leave anything behind

102
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,740
Good morning uncle and aunt

103
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,890
Why are you here again?

104
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,640
Uncle and aunt are going out

105
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,990
I'm here to pick them up

106
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,790
Where's Zhao Yuanfang?

107
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,890
He faked his reason for leave

108
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,340
So the boss cancelled his vacation

109
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,940
I have already asked for leave

110
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,670
My boss is reasonable and

111
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,540
considerate

112
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,090
He even lent me his car

113
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,670
and asked me to keep good accompany of you two

114
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,190
Xingxing

115
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,470
Is it true?

116
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,490
Is it?

117
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,640
Secretary Nie

118
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,090
Yes

119
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,490
The boss is very nice indeed

120
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,840
Uncle aunt

121
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,690
It's the same for you to have me with you, right?

122
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,890
The same of course

123
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,290
Let's go then

124
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,020
This way please

125
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,270
Let's go

126
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:46,940
Nie

127
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,490
Thank you

128
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,270
Thank you

129
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,570
Yan

130
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,390
Is it okay to call you Yan?

131
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,090
Sure aunt

132
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,490
Later

133
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,720
Please show my gratitude to your boss

134
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,270
OK

135
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,890
Aunt

136
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,790
My boss feels regret

137
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,420
the way he treated Secretary Nie

138
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,820
No, no , no

139
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,420
Actually back then

140
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,820
we wanted Xingxing to take a rest for some time

141
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,940
and asked her to quit

142
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,020
It has nothing to do with you

143
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,970
Mom!

144
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,520
I mean

145
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,840
It has nothing to do with your boss

146
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,690
Mom, where do you want to go today?

147
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,790
Yeah, aunt

148
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,890
Where do you want to go?

149
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,870
How about

150
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,470
go to the biggest mall in Jinghai here?

151
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,370
OK

152
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,370
Look

153
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,020
Come, quick

154
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,940
You are so slow

155
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,740
Check out that one

156
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,790
This one is nice

157
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,670
This one is gorgeous, this one is good

158
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:46,940
This one is nice

159
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,620
Mom, I think you get thinner

160
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
Look how comfortable my dad is

161
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,920
Nie

162
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,220
Go!

163
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,470
Uncle

164
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,420
Put me down please

165
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,090
I...

166
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Let go of me

167
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:18,620
Dad

168
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,270
How about lie down for some time more

169
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,690
Mom and I still need to shop

170
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,720
It's okay

171
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,620
We have been here having massage

172
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,670
for quite some time

173
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,720
Next we are changing into

174
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,540
glass cupping

175
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,420
glass cupping

176
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,520
glass cupping

177
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,720
Hmm, I may as well go shopping with aunt

178
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:40,460
Hurry, help me

179
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,820
Quickly

180
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,420
Xingxing

181
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,170
You mom and me do not come here often

182
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,990
Go and have fun with your mom

183
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,920
Just go, go

184
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,090
No, don't

185
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,690
Call me in case of anything happens

186
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,620
Later dad

187
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Yan

188
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,070
Talking about glass cupping

189
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,070
Yan

190
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,590
I was not lying, right?

191
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,920
Feeling comfortable?

192
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,440
Comfortable

193
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,220
Is it Yan who is screaming?

194
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,420
Really?

195
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,370
The first time your dad did glass cupping

196
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,720
he screamed even louder

197
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,370
He's got the nerve to record others

198
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,420
My dad is fearful of pain

199
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,270
All of men are afraid of pain

200
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,020
A scratched finger seems to be broken for them

201
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,420
If they have a bad cold, they will write into their suicide note

202
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,020
Tell you what

203
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,490
When I was giving birth to you,

204
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,370
you dad cried out loud as if I was dying

205
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,770
outside of the delivery room

206
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,070
Don't mention how shameful I was

207
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,990
Ah?

208
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,890
Mom are you talking about my dad?

209
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,470
Hard to believe right?

210
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,090
Men

211
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,090
Sometimes are not

212
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,370
as tough as we imagined

213
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,490
No kidding

214
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,540
Uncle

215
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,120
Yan

216
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,140
How are you feeling?

217
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,540
Relaxed

218
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,240
No wonder so many young people like health-related program

219
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,240
It's a program worth investing in

220
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,690
Well

221
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,690
Uncle

222
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,690
Hmm...

223
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,690
Can you help to keep it a secret?

224
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,390
What is about?

225
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,770
About me making strange noise just now

226
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,420
Well

227
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,070
You mean about your screaming out load just now?

228
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,290
Don't worry

229
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,820
I will clam up about it

230
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,990
I'm sure you will

231
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,290
Let's go

232
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,540
Where to?

233
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,340
They are still doing nail painting

234
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,140
We

235
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,490
are going for meal now

236
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,490
Go! Go! Go!

237
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,470
Go!

238
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,070
Wang Xin Zhuang

239
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,670
This one is nice

240
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,570
Here it is

241
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,740
Come

242
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,490
Have a seat

243
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,120
Uncle, well

244
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,590
How about changing another place?

245
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,090
What

246
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,970
Big boss can't eat here?

247
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,970
How do you...?

248
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,940
Xingxing already told us

249
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,220
that you are the boss of her previous company

250
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,170
Sit down, please

251
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,640
Well

252
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,540
Sorry, uncle

253
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,870
I'm kind of a neat freak

254
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,570
Well

255
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,370
How about I clean it for you?

256
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,220
No, no, no

257
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,570
No, I'm good

258
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,520
Have you done?

259
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,190
Yes

260
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:54,990
All good

261
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,870
Sit down

262
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,070
Hey

263
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,820
Take order

264
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,890
Mutton, Beef, Chicken Feet

265
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,020
Leeks, one plate for each

266
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,370
I will go get the beer

267
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,720
Hello, I want to know

268
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,020
how many strings for each

269
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,620
Five

270
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,490
We'll take two

271
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,470
OK

272
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,320
Thank you

273
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,940
It's fine

274
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,090
Sorry, uncle

275
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,920
I've got even number obsessive disorder

276
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,020
OK

277
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,220
OK

278
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,340
Yan

279
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,690
Thank you for keep us accompanied the whole day

280
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,590
Let me propose

281
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,690
a toast to you

282
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,170
Well, uncle

283
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,870
I asked the glass cupping guy just now

284
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,540
He said

285
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,690
that drinking is not allowed after cupping

286
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,790
You are quite something

287
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,390
Once in a while, it's fine

288
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,990
By the way

289
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,220
I forgot that you cannot drink

290
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,690
If only Zhao was here

291
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,790
Uncle, I can drink

292
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,120
I can

293
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,420
Impressive

294
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,570
Cheers

295
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,190
Drink up. Good

296
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,290
Come on

297
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,920
Yan

298
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,820
Let me tell you a story

299
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,940
OK

300
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,720
I remember that it was when Xingxing was six

301
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,640
She wanted to learn to play piano

302
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,420
But back then we were short of money

303
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,520
For the fear that it just a whim,

304
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,870
we didn't support her in doing this

305
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,240
So we deliberately took her to have a lesson

306
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,570
and wanted her to retreat

307
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,540
But unexpectedly

308
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,970
after this lesson

309
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,740
she was sitting on the bench learning to play

310
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,020
A week later

311
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,390
She was able to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

312
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,620
skillfully

313
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,470
It demonstrated her determination to learn piano

314
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,090
From then on

315
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,620
No matter what she does, we won't be in her way

316
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,420
She's indeed a person

317
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,340
who is assertive

318
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,590
and persistent

319
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,290
Yeah

320
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,420
That's who she is

321
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,390
Cheers

322
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,340
Uncle

323
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,720
How do you think of me?

324
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,320
You are nice

325
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,870
Thank you

326
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,690
How do you think of me to be your son-in-law?

327
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,820
Be careful

328
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,370
Thank you

329
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,270
Yan

330
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,020
About this matter

331
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,540
It's not important

332
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,290
how me and your aunt think

333
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,220
What matters is how Xingxing thinks

334
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,420
Understand

335
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,520
Got it?

336
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,270
Got it?

337
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,490
Hello

338
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,040
Can you serve the skewers earlier?

339
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,970
Sure

340
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,640
Uncle, another toast to you

341
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,340
Okay, drink

342
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,520
We are home

343
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,290
Look

344
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,290
There, I told you so

345
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,270
We were right, she opened the door

346
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,040
Dad

347
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,290
How much did you drink?

348
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,820
Not much

349
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,590
Just

350
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,440
A few glasses

351
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,920
Doesn't look like just a few for me

352
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,890
Okay dad

353
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,240
Mom is upstairs waiting for you

354
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,020
Just go upstairs

355
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,540
Wait

356
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,570
Bro

357
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,720
Don't forget our secret

358
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,620
I recognize you

359
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,040
as my bro

360
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,540
OK

361
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,470
Bro

362
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,290
Well

363
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,340
Go upstairs and sleep

364
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,570
Go!

365
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,420
Bro

366
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,520
Take care!

367
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,820
See you

368
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,890
Take it slow, dad

369
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,120
Let's keep drinking tomorrow

370
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,590
OK

371
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,690
I'm leaving

372
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,290
Go home, home

373
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,690
We are home

374
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,990
What home?

375
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,620
It's my home, Yan Jingzhi

376
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,270
I'm home

377
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,910
Why did you drink so much?

378
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,690
Don't undress yourself

379
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,670
Go home

380
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,190
Let go of me

381
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,220
Ask my bro

382
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,090
whether we've drunk too much?

383
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,370
Yan Jingzhi

384
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,240
Bro

385
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,440
Yan Jingzhi

386
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,570
Yan Jingzhi

387
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:08,770
Secretary Nie

388
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,240
You really came to get me

389
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:15,570
Go in

390
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,240
Go home

391
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,420
Go... Go home

392
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,970
This way

393
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,540
It is hot

394
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,720
Stay still

395
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,120
I will prepare you bath water

396
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,570
Take a shower first

397
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,120
It is hot

398
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,070
Shower

399
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,920
Take shower

400
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,440
Take shower

401
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,940
Take shower

402
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,090
Yan Jingzhi

403
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,720
Yan Jingzhi, can you get dressed?!

404
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,920
I cannot wear clothes while taking shower

405
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,120
Get down, don't stand up

406
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,920
Go go, take shower

407
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,790
Done

408
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,840
Not yet

409
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,990
You have't took any shower yet

410
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,420
Turn right

411
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,970
Hurry

412
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,520
Bro

413
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,640
Take care!

414
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,520
I am stuck

415
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,290
Hey

416
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,170
Secretary Nie

417
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,620
You walked in a straight line

418
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,440
Xingchen, I miss you

419
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,190
Take shower

420
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,890
Oh no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

421
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,640
Oh no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

422
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,220
I'm screwed

423
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,520
Yes

424
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,940
Yes

425
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,340
Understand

426
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,520
Understand

427
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:31,940
Guys

428
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,790
Listen

429
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,090
Mr. Yan

430
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,620
won't be in the office today

431
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,540
Skip work for two days in a row, so abnormal

432
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,470
Is it possible that he is dating Zhen Nian again?

433
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,920
It's impossible

434
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,340
The gossip of Mr. Yan and Zhen Nian

435
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,770
lasted just a few days before it's gone

436
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,790
Apparently it's fake news

437
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:48,640
I believe that

438
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,240
Mr. Yan is dating someone else

439
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,070
How unexpected that Mr. Yan has got a brain to love

440
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,740
Is it possible that our company is going to collapse?

441
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,020
Shut up you doomsayer

442
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,270
It's never gonna happen

443
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,590
Even if the Arctic Ocean melts, Mount

444
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,170
Everest be leveled

445
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,420
Mr. Yan skips work every day

446
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,520
Bojue will stand still

447
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,090
What is it, Zhao Yuanfang

448
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:22,890
Miss Zhen Nian

449
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,090
What can I do for you?

450
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,890
It's none of your business

451
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,570
If you came here for Yan Jingzhi

452
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,370
I need to remind you

453
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,970
that he is not here today

454
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,970
Plus you told me last time that

455
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,720
you didn't even get a chance

456
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,490
Why do you do the meaningless struggle?

457
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,240
Can it be better to leave decently?

458
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,970
Is seems that Mr. Zhao have a tendency to interfere with other's matters

459
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,970
Every Marvel hero

460
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,090
has this tendency

461
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,570
Then a hero like Mr. Zhao

462
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,520
thinks I need to be rescued

463
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,540
Not really

464
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,390
But I think

465
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,120
Now that Yan Jingzhi has got someone he likes

466
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,220
You'd better not be the wicked one

467
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,970
Learn to let go

468
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,340
I get it

469
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,520
This hero is not trying to rescue me

470
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,720
but Nie Xingchen

471
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,040
You like her but pretend not to

472
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:08,990
Zhao Yuanfang

473
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,420
What a coward you are

474
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,520
I'm not like you

475
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,840
I can let go

476
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,290
But before that

477
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,070
I will hold as tight

478
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,290
as I can

479
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,170
Miss Zhen

480
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,120
Here's a reminder for you

481
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,640
Don't talk nonsense

482
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
if you don't know it well

483
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,740
And

484
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,140
I will got your drunk photos

485
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,820
in my phone

486
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,120
I will sell them for money

487
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,020
You

488
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,440
You rat!

489
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,020
Wait a min

490
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Who's it?

491
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,170
Good morning

492
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,190
Yan

493
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,920
Come in please

494
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,690
Come

495
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,720
Good morning, uncle

496
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,440
Yan

497
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,120
Good morning

498
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,370
What's this?

499
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,140
It's Bergamot Lean Barley Soup

500
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,740
It can relieve the symptom of fatigue after drinking

501
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,670
Drink it while it's still warm

502
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:18,970
Look

503
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,470
It's very kind of you to do so

504
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,040
Well

505
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,070
Where's Xingchen?

506
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,420
She's out buying me food

507
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,590
You are leaving today right?

508
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,870
Please give me your ID cards

509
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,040
I will book air tickets for you

510
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,990
No, thanks

511
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,590
Xingxing has booked them already

512
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,390
Then I will upgrade them to first classes

513
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,920
It's easier for you this way

514
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,890
I didn't know that you were coming here

515
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,040
So I was not well prepared

516
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,170
Next time when you come Jinghai

517
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,320
Do stay longer

518
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,690
Don't bother

519
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,520
By the way

520
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,140
I prepared some Jinghai specialties

521
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,290
Please take home and share with your friends

522
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,620
No, no, thanks

523
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,590
It's too much

524
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,470
To expensive to accept

525
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,420
No, thanks

526
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,790
I didn't prepare any gift last time while visiting

527
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,770
It's my fault

528
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,090
It's a gift to you as my thanks

529
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,190
Please do accept them

530
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,220
Yan

531
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,870
We are unable to

532
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,240
take them with us

533
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,390
I will ask them to send them to the airport

534
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,470
By the time when you arrive Shashi

535
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,590
I will send someone from the Shashi Branch to pick you up

536
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,720
You've got branch in Shashi also?

537
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,570
We've got branched

538
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,440
all over the major cities in China

539
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,390
Yan

540
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,890
I see

541
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:19,590
Silly me

542
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,890
Busy talking

543
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,970
Come and have a seat

544
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:22,790
Have some water

545
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,660
Have a seat

546
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,800
Sit and have some water It's okay aunt

547
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,620
Don't bother

548
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,920
Drink some soup uncle

549
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,790
I will ask them to send things downstairs

550
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:31,770
Go!

551
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,140
Well

552
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,190
Thank you so much

553
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:34,920
Welcome

554
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,590
Thank you so much

555
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:36,790
Thank you

556
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,920
Thank you

557
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:42,720
Nie

558
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,540
Don't you think that Yan is quite strange?

559
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,490
He is trying to make Xingxing stay there to work

560
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,240
I can understand

561
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,380
But what is all these

562
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,740
changing first class seats and gifts?

563
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,370
Don't you think it's too much?

564
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,690
Your daughter is trying to fool you

565
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,470
Don't believe her nonsense

566
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,690
You mean

567
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,120
That's what I thought

568
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,340
There's no need to rush

569
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,970
Look at our daughter

570
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,020
She's got such a good chaser as Yan

571
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,490
And Zhao

572
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,890
Either of them to be my son-in-law

573
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,340
I will be just as satisfied

574
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,220
Son in law?

575
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,940
Zhao has

576
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,240
a face of love blossoms

577
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,320
and is cheeky all day

578
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,320
How can he be our son in law?

579
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,920
Uncle, you have good taste!

580
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,120
As for Yan

581
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,390
He's a nice guy

582
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,870
But too rich

583
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,920
Not a suitable match for our family

584
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,640
I'm afraid if Xingxing married to him,

585
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,370
she'll suffer

586
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,390
Suffer?

587
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,570
It's not good to be rich?

588
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,090
It's his fault to be rich?

589
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,820
Have you forgotten Xingxing's first boyfriend?

590
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,240
Do you want our girl

591
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,220
to experience that again?

592
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,240
Yeah

593
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,140
If it wasn't the boy's family that object to...

594
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,320
Yan Jingzhi

595
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,470
Uncle, aunt

596
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,190
Xingxing

597
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,890
Listen to me

598
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,640
Eat properly

599
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,920
Less instant noodles and take-out food

600
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,470
They're not good for your health

601
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,720
I know, mom

602
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,070
Come home often

603
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,840
Have a safe trip

604
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,820
Xingxing

605
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,770
Take good care of yourself

606
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,640
Mom and dad will go and see you sometime

607
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,840
Yan

608
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,190
Thank you for spending time with us these days

609
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,740
You're welcome, uncle

610
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,290
All right

611
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,570
Take care and be safe

612
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,570
Let's go

613
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,970
Bye, dad

614
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:01,360
OK

615
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,270
Goodbye, uncle

616
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,240
Time to go

617
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,390
Goodbye, Aunt

618
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,970
I want to know the whole truth

619
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,640
If you don't tell me,

620
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,390
I'll let uncle and aunt know

621
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,890
that I was your first boyfriend

622
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Uncle, aunt

623
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,390
Come visit us often

624
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,170
OK

625
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,220
Have a safe trip

626
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,320
Go back!

627
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,140
I will tell

628
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,770
Six years ago,

629
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,120
as a work-study student,

630
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,620
I was working in a coffee shop

631
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,290
and that's where I met you

632
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,690
We fell in love soon after

633
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
I thought that same as me,

634
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,620
you were a white-collar from an ordinary family

635
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,920
until your father came to me

636
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,370
Bye

637
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,520
Are you MIss Nie Xingchen?

638
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,690
Yes, I am

639
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,590
May I ask who you are?

640
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,570
I'm Yan Jingzhi's father

641
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,870
Uncle Yan

642
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,690
Jingzhi didn't mention that you were coming

643
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,220
How about we wait for him to finish work

644
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,920
and have dinner together?

645
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,320
What do you think?

646
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,870
No, thanks. Miss Nie

647
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,820
I'm here for you today

648
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,640
What can I do for you?

649
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,170
I hope that you can leave Jingzhi

650
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,090
Do you mind if I ask why?

651
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,190
I have no problem with you personally

652
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,920
But I looked into your family

653
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,790
and I don't think you're suitable for Jingzhi

654
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,370
Both your parents are ordinary workers

655
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,190
The annual income of your whole family

656
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,720
cannot afford a place in the most prosperous area of Jinghai

657
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,240
Not even one square meter

658
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,890
But Jingzhi insists on staying in Jinghai because of you

659
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,040
So he missed lots of opportunities I've arranged for him

660
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,870
Such opportunities

661
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,320
It's impossible for a family like yours to compensate for it

662
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,220
That's why you two are not suitable

663
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,520
I got it

664
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,590
In your opinion,

665
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,170
my family is not good enough for yours

666
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,220
So if I still don't agree

667
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,120
are you going to throw bank card on me?

668
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,790
I didn't mean to do it that way

669
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,890
But if you make the request

670
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,340
I will think about it

671
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,440
No, thanks. Uncle Yan

672
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,140
I don't know how rich your family is

673
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,540
And I don't care

674
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,690
Because the one I fell in love with is Jingzhi

675
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,370
Not you

676
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,370
Miss Nie

677
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,490
I think if you were able to convince him,

678
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
you wouldn't come and talk to me

679
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,040
Since he didn't give up,

680
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,020
I won't give him up either

681
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,990
because of what you said to me

682
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,140
May be we'll break up in future,

683
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,920
but only for relationship problems

684
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,770
instead of what you said

685
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,790
family issues

686
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,190
Miss Nie

687
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,970
You haven't graduated from college yet

688
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,740
Simple and naive

689
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,690
You and Jingzhi grew up in different environments

690
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,040
The starting line is different

691
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,390
So is the social circle you're in

692
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,990
For the two from different social ranks,

693
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,890
it won't last long even if they end up being together

694
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,540
Because what truly keeps the marriage going

695
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,890
is not love

696
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,190
Marriage

697
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,620
is about the suitable match of the two families

698
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,990
I agree with you

699
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,390
But I think

700
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,320
Being a suitable match is not only materially

701
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,020
It's more emotionally and spiritually

702
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,790
It seems that neither of us can persuade the other today

703
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,690
I have classes in the afternoon

704
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,240
I got to leave

705
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,370
Miss Nie

706
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,220
Jingzhi is going to propose to you today

707
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,840
He had the jewelry designer of the company

708
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,870
custom made a ring

709
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,320
Required it to be made by today

710
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,570
No disrespect

711
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,190
But I hope you won't say yes to him

712
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,690
Uncle Yan

713
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,620
If you do feel disrespectful,

714
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,490
don't say it

715
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,220
I love Jingzhi

716
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,320
So I'm going to say yes

717
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,090
Goodbye

718
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,790
Why do I feel

719
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,270
you have something on your mind today?

720
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,820
No

721
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,440
I'm thinking about the internship

722
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,070
Actually

723
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,720
You can come to work in our company

724
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,020
I...

725
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:01,820
Jingzhi

726
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,470
I want to have the ice cream here

727
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,320
Can you order one for me?

728
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,640
OK

729
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,420
Glutton

730
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,390
Wait here

731
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,790
You finally answered the phone

732
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,690
Where are you?

733
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,240
Uncle Yan

734
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,470
It's me

735
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,620
Miss Nie

736
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,520
You should know

737
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,290
I will stop you two from being together

738
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,790
on all accounts

739
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,820
If you want to come,

740
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,520
I'll send you the address

741
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,540
But I won't change my mind

742
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,920
Where is my ice cream?

743
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,120
Xingchen

744
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,970
I'm willing to give you my whole universe

745
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,920
Would you like to be

746
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,820
the brightest star in my universe?

747
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,490
Jingzhi

748
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,590
Your father passed away in a car accident

749
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:38,790
Doctor

750
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:39,970
Yan Jingzhi, he...

751
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,240
Miss Nie

752
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,520
Your boyfriend is awake

753
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,140
But there's a something I want to tell you

754
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,520
What's wrong?

755
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,120
Mr. Yan, he

756
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,820
lost his memories

757
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,570
Lost his memories?

758
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,320
Yes

759
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:04,920
After that

760
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,770
I tried a few times to make sure of that

761
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,090
And I realized you really don't remember me

762
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,070
Because of what happened to your father

763
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,990
I didn't know how to face you

764
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,040
So

765
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,120
So you just walked away while I lost my memory

766
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,320
I'm sorry

767
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,070
Your father's incident

768
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,340
I had responsibility too

769
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,390
If he wasn't going to stop us on that day

770
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,620
If I didn't send him the address

771
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,620
If I didn't turn off your phone

772
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:45,240
It's still possible for you

773
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,820
to see your father for the last time

774
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,470
It was all my fault

775
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,270
Is that why you left me five years ago

776
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,290
and refused me five years later?

777
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:07,890
Xingchen

778
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,040
You're very selfish

779
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,770
I know

780
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,040
Whatever I say is not going to fix anything

781
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,090
But I've never said it in front of you

782
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,920
I'm sorry

783
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,040
I'm sorry

784
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:29,840
I'm sorry

785
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,270
Do you intend to live with the sense of guilt

786
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,770
so that it can show your sincerity?

787
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,590
I can make it up to you

788
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,140
How are you going to do it?

789
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,820
Take the machine back

790
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,840
listen to my father and break up with me?

791
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,820
Or do you have some way to make me

792
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,720
live without your unreal figure

793
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,070
which brought me constant torture in the past five years?

794
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,570
Did you just say

795
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,790
While I was proposing to you

796
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,870
I passed out

797
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:04,620
And when I woke up

798
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,420
I lost my memory?

799
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,370
The doctors did medical examinations on you

800
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:17,140
and said there's no problem with your body functions

801
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,690
So they couldn't tell

802
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:19,920
the cause of your amnesia

803
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,990
Do we have anything left when we were together?

804
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:29,490
Yes

805
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,320
Give them back to me

806
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,570
They're meaningless to you now

807
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:36,920
But for me

808
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:38,590
That's my memory

809
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:52,990
OK

810
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,790
I'll pack them up and bring to you

811
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:36,970
Have you finished shower?

812
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:48,890
Why don't you take shower?

813
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,540
I might be poisoned

814
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,120
Poisoned?
