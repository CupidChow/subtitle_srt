1
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,950
Put these on

2
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,030
I just don't want to see

3
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,980
anything goes wrong to my former staff

4
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,680
Stay until the rain stops

5
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,850
Left so early

6
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,980
The third project of architectural design

7
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,030
is from TS Architectural Design Company of Germany

8
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,550
They emphasize on simplicity

9
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,300
and conciseness

10
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,030
The absolute purism style

11
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,200
Mr. Yan

12
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,380
How do you think of it?

13
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,180
Mr. Yan

14
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,550
That's all for today

15
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,550
Send the designing projects to my office

16
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,100
Hey, guys

17
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,830
Let's stop here, shall we?

18
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,930
OK

19
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,680
Thank you so much

20
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,730
Come here, come here

21
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,280
I find that

22
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,150
Mr. Yan started being abstracted

23
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,430
just after Secretary Nie left

24
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,180
Do you think there's something going on between he and Xingchen?

25
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,180
Impossible

26
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,200
Impossible, right?

27
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,180
You're overthinking

28
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,380
It's not possible

29
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,430
Regarding Yuanda got acquired over one night

30
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,880
by Bojue

31
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,080
Opinions vary in the industry

32
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,200
Miss Nie has worked in Yuanda for five years

33
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,300
What's your opinion on this?

34
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,630
Mr. Gu

35
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,450
Firstly I think

36
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,430
the word "acquired" is not accurate

37
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,730
Yuanda

38
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,400
is a company with promising future

39
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,780
And there's no operational problem of it

40
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,730
Mr. Zhao chose to "join" Bojue

41
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,100
because he values the advantages of a transnational group

42
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,030
which can help to increase Yuanda's market share in short term

43
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,250
and enhance its competitiveness in the industry

44
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,580
It has been proved that Mr. Zhao's decision is correct

45
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,950
It's also my pleasure

46
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,050
to be working for Yuanda as it's growing ever since

47
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,380
It seems that Miss Nie's emotional connection to your former employer

48
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,430
is quite strong

49
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,130
In that case

50
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,700
why did you choose to leave?

51
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,850
After Yuanda joined Bojue,

52
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,930
there have been some changes in my work position

53
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,630
But I still prefer to do the work

54
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,280
related to my specialty

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,380
That's why I chose your company

56
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,480
and applied for the HR position

57
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,480
The last question

58
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,980
If you join Yatai

59
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,330
can you accept working in Shanghai?

60
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,250
The recruitment information shows

61
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,980
that workplace is in Jinghai

62
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,800
There is job vacancy in headquarter here

63
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,450
But I want to set up a branch in Shanghai

64
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,280
With Miss Nie's qualifications

65
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,650
You're capable to work in the branch

66
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
I would like to think about it

67
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,250
Because I have been working and living for

68
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,850
nine years in Jinghai

69
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,250
Sure

70
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,600
Then that's it for today

71
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,900
You'll be informed of the result of interview

72
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,250
OK

73
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,280
I'll go back then

74
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,150
Let me show you the way out

75
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,250
Hope you think about it first

76
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,330
Also if we have any result here

77
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,350
we will let you know as soon as possible

78
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,400
Hello, Mr. Yan

79
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,800
Welcome to Yatai

80
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,980
Hello, Mr. Gu

81
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,080
I just happened

82
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,250
to be interviewing a former employee of Bojue

83
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,480
Miss Nie

84
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,050
Mr. Yan

85
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
I forgot

86
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,280
Miss Nie had joined Bojue not for long

87
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,730
Maybe you don't know her

88
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,950
We not only know each other,

89
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,130
but also know each other very well

90
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,800
Miss Nie was my Chief Secretary

91
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,300
I heard Mr. Yan has high requirements

92
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,400
for your secretary

93
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,830
Miss Nie is the best secretary I have ever seen

94
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,530
Mr. Gu

95
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,500
Let's talk business first

96
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,580
Of course

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,180
Mr. Yan, please wait in the conference room for a moment

98
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,180
I'll be there shortly

99
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:40,930
OK

100
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,280
Miss Nie

101
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,830
I'm glad you choose Yatai

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,430
I formally invite you to join us now

103
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,750
Mr. Gu

104
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
I'd like to work in Shanghai Branch

105
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,580
I'll go back to work now

106
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,200
Surprise!

107
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:30,950
How come you're here?

108
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,550
You are so busy at work

109
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,030
So stressful

110
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,230
That's why

111
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,950
I've to provide good logistics support

112
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,330
Make sure you get enough nutrition

113
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,280
What are you going to make?

114
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,200
I can help you

115
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,850
No, thanks

116
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,680
I don't like people around when I'm cooking

117
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,130
Will let you know when I finish

118
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,000
Where is the kitchen?

119
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,430
OK

120
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,030
Are you sure you can do it alone?

121
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,350
Of course

122
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,530
If you watch me

123
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,630
I'll be nervous and do it poorly

124
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,950
Don't worry

125
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,100
Okay

126
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,080
Braised Eggplant with Pork Mince

127
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,750
One or two eggplants

128
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,400
Is it one or two?

129
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,930
Small piece of pork

130
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,730
This is not big, right?

131
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,450
Soy sauce in moderation

132
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,050
In moderation?

133
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,350
A little salt

134
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,480
A little?

135
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,200
Millet pepper in proper quantity

136
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,970
Oh no

137
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,730
Another one

138
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,680
Mapo Tofu

139
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,580
It must be delicious

140
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,150
Cut Tofu into equal sized cubes

141
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,800
Equal sized cubes

142
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,530
Moderate amount of garlic

143
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,430
Moderate amount of chilly bean sauce

144
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,050
OK guys

145
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,780
Let's do it

146
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,200
Dr. Han

147
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,400
Meal is ready

148
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,300
You really know how to cook

149
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,230
For my idol

150
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,980
I can take any challenge

151
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,750
It looks really good

152
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,650
I'll start eating then

153
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,980
Go ahead

154
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,030
How's the flavor?

155
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,930
It's a bit strong

156
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,300
Like restaurant cooked ones

157
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,950
That's right!

158
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,150
I learnt it from a restaurant chef

159
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,900
Dr. Han

160
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,280
Have a fish ball

161
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,430
The fish balls, they took me very long time to...

162
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,130
Watch out!

163
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,990
It's fine

164
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,000
Thanks for the take-out you bought me

165
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,750
You're welcome

166
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,250
What's wrong?

167
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,630
Choked on a fish bone?

168
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:31,800
Come on

169
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,130
Open your mouth

170
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,880
Relax, relax

171
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,500
Don't move your tongue

172
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,900
Open widely

173
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,700
Dr. Han

174
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,680
I'd better go to hospital to take the fish bone out

175
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,680
Mr. Yan

176
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,300
Take your time to talk

177
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,330
What brings you here at this time?

178
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,350
I'm scared

179
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,700
Mr. Yan

180
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,630
Why does Mr. Yan look like a master of this place?

181
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,300
It's not right

182
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,230
I'm not a mistress

183
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,050
Why should I run away?

184
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,750
But I don't understand

185
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,200
Jinghai has no place for you anymore

186
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,400
You have to go to Shanghai

187
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,180
I'm only going for one year

188
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,850
As soon as the team is built over there

189
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,430
I'll be back

190
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,250
What level of leader you are

191
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,350
going to be the head over there

192
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,480
When Yuanda was founded at that time

193
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,780
I was behind you

194
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,750
But now

195
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,030
You're like a commander without any army

196
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,400
A stranger in a strange place

197
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,750
Have you thought about it?

198
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,830
Actually, I miss it a lot

199
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,400
When we started the business at first

200
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,700
We were so excited and stimulated

201
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,300
Only thinking about how to get the job done

202
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,800
How to get the company on track

203
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,150
Although it was so tiring everyday

204
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,000
we could still go back to work on the next day, energetically

205
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,300
You were busy trying to forget about Yan Jingzhi

206
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,780
What's the big deal about him

207
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,230
makes you have to go to another city

208
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,080
Being in the same city

209
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,380
it's inevitable to meet each other

210
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,650
Staying away

211
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,450
is good for both

212
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,630
Although

213
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,100
I don't suggest that you look back

214
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,480
But Yan Jingzhi might think differently

215
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,430
The last time when he met your parents

216
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,280
It didn't look like he wanted to end it

217
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,580
Anyway I have told him

218
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,650
that his father's accident was because of me

219
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,250
You put too much mustard

220
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,480
Cheers

221
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,400
Cheers

222
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,030
What's between you and Miss Nie

223
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,380
should be the miserable love

224
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,950
But I have to remind you

225
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,050
She's fooled you many times before

226
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,880
It may not be full truth either this time

227
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,230
From what I know about my dad,

228
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,400
that part she said should be true

229
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,730
So why do you think

230
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,230
people have to be in relationships?

231
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,530
Bring themselves and others so much trouble

232
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,680
It would be a peaceful world if everyone just mind their own business

233
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,380
Just now

234
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,980
Forget it

235
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,050
It's you haven't meet the one

236
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,950
who can complete your world

237
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,200
Shall I go to cook the meals again?

238
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,150
Let's have some drink

239
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,850
Don't bother

240
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,930
I just wanna know

241
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,000
whether I can get my memory back

242
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,400
Now one thing we can be sure

243
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,850
is that you have lost all your memory after graduation and returning home,

244
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,150
from knowing Miss Nie

245
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,980
to you proposed marriage to her

246
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,430
No matter from which aspect,

247
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,650
she is the key for your memory recovery

248
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,250
I have tried

249
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,930
I could recall nothing

250
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,430
Since you used to recall your memory so eagerly

251
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,280
to find the owner of the ring

252
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,180
Now you have found it

253
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,650
And you also get a result from this

254
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,100
Why do you so stick to the process?

255
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,230
Maybe I just wanna try to recall

256
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,050
to remind me from time to time

257
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,830
of the silly past

258
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,050
One year, I was ice fishing in north

259
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,930
The temperature was over 30 degrees below zero

260
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,550
Really cold that day

261
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,050
Then I insisted for more than two hours

262
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,200
But I couldn't make it to the last

263
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,530
After that, my friend caught a large fish

264
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,580
From then to now

265
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,980
I always feel extremely sorry from that

266
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,430
Why didn't I

267
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,050
insist longer that day?

268
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,380
Not all things can be achieved with only insist

269
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,350
As a doctor,

270
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,580
I suggest you should keep a distance from Nie Xingchen immediately

271
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,930
concerning on your mental and physical health

272
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,300
But as your friend

273
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,450
I really don't want to see you regret

274
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,750
after the fish being caught by others

275
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,780
You know why I say these

276
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,750
Let's try hard together

277
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,200
Honey

278
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,000
I miss you so much!

279
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,750
Honey

280
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,300
Are you getting thinner again?

281
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,950
Aren't you are going to spend a month on the sea?

282
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,550
Why do you come back so quickly?

283
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,800
For seeing my honey son

284
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,280
I don't need a reason

285
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,330
OK

286
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,680
It's Ziyu who called me

287
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,130
and told me something

288
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,850
I'm just at home

289
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,430
So I flew back overnight

290
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:53,850
I'm fine

291
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,800
You can go anywhere you want

292
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,800
I am too busy

293
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,200
with no time to accompany you

294
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,450
Honey

295
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,130
that I...

296
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,830
made a little mistake

297
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,830
What mistake did you make again?

298
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,300
I tell you then

299
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,500
Promise you won't be angry

300
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,550
I will be angry if you don't tell me

301
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:25,950
In fact, it is

302
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,300
after Ziyu calling me

303
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,180
I recalled carefully about the condition five years ago

304
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,430
Actually

305
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,750
Your father have said something

306
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,500
before he passed away

307
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,580
If

308
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,600
I could accompany with you more,

309
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,450
will you still leave me?

310
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,050
We are not fit in personalities

311
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,200
In fact, separating is good for both of us

312
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,950
But

313
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,430
So many years

314
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,150
You

315
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,530
you stayed alone

316
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,800
Cuz

317
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,700
I've loved you all my life

318
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,100
Yan

319
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,700
Now I can see

320
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,680
Jingzhi

321
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,450
Jingzhi is like you

322
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,180
Jingzhi is coming here soon

323
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,650
Wait

324
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,180
Jingzhi is coming here soon

325
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,050
I...

326
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,450
I shouldn't keep you here

327
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,400
What?

328
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,200
Only if

329
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,780
he can be happy

330
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,030
He used to say that before?

331
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,450
At that time,

332
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,100
I was busy on your father's funeral issues

333
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,100
You were also in hospital at that time

334
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,650
It's all my fault

335
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,980
How can I be so carelessly

336
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,250
How can I forget this thing?

337
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,650
It can't blame to you

338
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,530
You don't know about the situation then

339
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,030
You don't blame me?

340
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,880
Since you have known the real situation

341
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,680
and I have come back now

342
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,080
Let's go to Miss Nie and explain this well

343
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,000
Don't try so hard!

344
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,530
I have to

345
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,380
think about this

346
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,630
Dad

347
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,750
I heard from Secretary Liu that you don't feel well in your waist

348
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,900
How is it now?

349
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,450
My doctor is responsible for my health

350
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,150
But it is not you who should worry about this

351
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,750
Dad

352
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,600
I am just worried about you

353
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,650
The most useless thing in this world

354
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,580
is meaningless care

355
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,700
We are wasting our time and energy here

356
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,200
It won't help anything to my waist

357
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,780
That unneeded consumption

358
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,680
What's your plan after graduation?

359
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,150
I need half a year to finish my master course

360
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,380
I don't have anymore plans

361
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,230
I have told you so many times

362
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,850
You must plan everything ahead

363
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,530
If you don't plan your life,

364
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,200
you are involved in the life

365
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,030
I see

366
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,350
I have thought for you

367
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,680
After graduation, come back to domestic companies

368
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,950
work in the bottom line for a year

369
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,980
After you have known the domestic market,

370
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,450
you can work in domestic companies as managers

371
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,500
About your marriage in the future,

372
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,850
I think Hanna is a good choice

373
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,500
You can consider about further development with her

374
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,500
Dad

375
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,200
Hanna and I are just friends

376
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,250
and she has loved one

377
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,180
It doesn't matter who Hanna loves

378
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,800
It matters that you fit each other

379
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,100
The unsuccessful marriage of your mother and me

380
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,280
has already proved this

381
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,530
This is my life

382
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,030
I have rights to live in the way I am pleased to

383
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,800
The condition is you must do good to your life!

384
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,730
Or

385
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,150
I won't answer it

386
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,130
Dad

387
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:34,980
Thank you

388
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,300
Mr. Yan

389
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,900
Could you

390
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,180
please

391
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,550
approve my annual leave?

392
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,480
Mr. Zhao asked for a marriage holiday, then annual leave

393
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,280
Then next must be maternity leave?

394
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,800
No, that can't be possible

395
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,980
After all, it is for the one I love

396
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,430
will leave Jinghai

397
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,500
I am going to see her away

398
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,400
I don't care about your private affair

399
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,300
But you have already asked for a leave for fifteen days

400
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,850
It affected the benefit of the company greatly

401
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,800
I have to have it

402
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,180
no matter what you say

403
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,280
After all, man

404
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,080
cannot lost his feelings

405
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,880
and become a robot for working

406
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,400
Valuing feelings is my life attitude

407
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:31,880
I believe

408
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,200
the one you are going to see off don't want you to do such things

409
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,200
Yeah, that's true

410
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,150
But she lived in Jinghai for nearly ten years

411
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,980
I don't know why she is leaving so accidently

412
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,680
If it were you,

413
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,800
would you go to see her off?

414
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,080
And she is heading to a place

415
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,130
nameless and far away

416
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,450
I don't know what's that for

417
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,900
Mr. Yan

418
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,100
If you don't agree

419
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,330
Just consider me skipping my working time

420
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,050
I'm leaving

421
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,380
I'm leaving

422
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,080
Bye

423
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,130
Bye

424
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,650
You are leaving Jinghai

425
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,380
To where?

426
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,080
To work in another place

427
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:40,900
At least you should choose one

428
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,830
better than Jinghai or Bojue

429
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,630
Then you can make it up to

430
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,150
the natural attitude that you left suddenly that year

431
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,200
Now you choose to lower your price

432
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,680
to such a poor place

433
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,400
Are you going to atone for your crime?

434
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,350
Or you are waiting for me to bite the bait?

435
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,430
A trick acted for me?

436
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,600
I don't know what you are taking about

437
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,450
But I am going to work in Shanghai

438
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,600
It's not a nameless or poor place as you say

439
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,680
Are you here for telling me these things?

440
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,450
I am for the stuff five years ago

441
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:12,980
Then wait a minute

442
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,350
I will go pack up now

443
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,930
I have no time for you

444
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,780
When you finish, send it to my home

445
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,510
Zhao Yuanfang

446
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,940
What nonsense did you say to him?

447
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,560
I just want to leave peacefully and quietly

448
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,460
Don't bother me anymore, OK?

449
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,040
If Yan Jingzhi really wants to end with you

450
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,010
he wouldn't get so angry by me

451
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,890
He is being angry now

452
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,410
If you don't want to see me bothered by him so much

453
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,890
Stop talking

454
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,790
See you

455
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,090
If I don't say that to him,

456
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,640
you will definitely keep trapped here all your lives!

457
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,440
Come in

458
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,010
Don't bother

459
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,410
All is here

460
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,790
I will leave after handling them to you

461
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,010
If you don't come in and count up

462
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,790
How can I know what's in it?

463
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,140
Honey

464
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,960
Help me with the pajamas

465
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,090
Yes

466
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,240
It seems it's convenient for you now

467
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,440
Then I won't bother you

468
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,890
Hello

469
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,210
Hello

470
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,460
I am HR of Yatai

471
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,560
I feel sorry that

472
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,710
we cannot hire you

473
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,490
May I ask the reason?

474
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,710
Mr. Gu says you know that

475
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,490
It's you who let Yatai to fire me!

476
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,290
It's me

477
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,190
Yan Jingzhi

478
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,740
If you want to get it back from me, go straight!

479
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,110
Don't bother to use tricks!

480
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,410
Don't you say you are going to amend me?

481
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,290
Well

482
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,790
Miss Ye has just arrived in Jinghai

483
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,260
You are responsible for accompany her around

484
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,710
This child

485
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,540
doesn't even know to find a place to sit and wait

486
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,260
Sorry!

487
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,540
I was in the traffic jam

488
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,740
Shall we change a place?

489
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,260
Are you Miss Nie?

490
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,390
Yes

491
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,840
This is the dessert ordered by your friend

492
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,210
You need to pay the bill

493
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,940
OK

494
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,440
Ok, thanks

495
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,110
Good temper

496
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,910
Fit for my honey

497
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,240
I have been too starved to wait for food

498
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,960
Shall we go to have a walk in the park?

499
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,110
Don't worry, don't worry

500
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,840
It is what I owe Yan Jingzhi

501
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:53,940
Sorry

502
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,540
I'm in your way

503
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:06,590
Hey

504
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,510
You seem to be in a bad mood

505
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,510
I'm fine

506
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,210
I am waiting for someone

507
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,210
Someone?

508
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,740
Why don't you call?

509
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,090
We made an appointment

510
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,460
If there is any change,

511
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,290
she would text me

512
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,560
Can you take a photo of me?

513
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,760
OK

514
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,840
One, two

515
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,440
Wait

516
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,490
Higher

517
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,940
Have this with me

518
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,260
One, two

519
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,110
Wait

520
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,510
Should I have any pose?

521
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,990
Is this OK?

522
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,540
OK

523
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,190
Come on

524
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,240
One, two, three

525
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,410
What's the problem? Are you OK?

526
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,660
I...

527
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,140
Maybe I didn't have breakfast today

528
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,740
So I feel dizzy now

529
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,110
Then

530
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,460
Is this your cake?

531
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,160
Yes

532
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,340
Can you sell it to me?

533
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,140
But some one ordered it

534
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,710
So I can't make this deal

535
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,060
But I have candles in my pocket

536
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:23,990
Here

537
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,390
you are

538
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,110
You have candles with you?

539
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,060
I know a friend with hypoglycemie

540
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,310
So used to it

541
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,040
Some one you like?

542
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,660
You treats others sincerely

543
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,540
Others will also feel it

544
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,490
You will be happy

545
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,460
Goodbye

546
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,960
Come to my house

547
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,940
You Miss Ye tricked me for a whole day

548
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,590
You have had it up now?

549
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,640
Do you have just so little sorry for me?

550
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,460
If you are going to trick me

551
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,490
I would be happy to play with you

552
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,960
But I hope you wouldn't

553
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,110
involve others

554
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,240
and work

555
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,710
This is only request of mine

556
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,290
Whatever I ask you to do, are you willing to?

557
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,210
As long as it doesn't break the ethnicity

558
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,460
and my personal bottom line

559
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,060
Good!

560
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,860
I don't want it, thanks

561
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,610
Tomorrow

562
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,210
I will prepare a surprise

563
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,090
for someone really important

564
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,440
You must watch the event planning company

565
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,860
to complete the scene layout

566
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,610
And contact with most famous photographer

567
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,890
on Weibo of Bojue Tourism Shooting

568
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,110
I need a follow record with all directions

569
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,840
There will be flowers transported here through air

570
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,910
Check them

571
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,840
for any harm

572
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,560
Rehearsal in advance to check the lights

573
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,010
Make sure nothing is wrong

574
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,840
When you choose photographer, you must be aware of his ability of taking snapshots

575
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,960
I need everything perfect tomorrow

576
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,410
I have got it

577
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,460
You know me well

578
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:02,840
So I guess you will

579
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,660
do it well

580
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,310
Help me with a spoon

581
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,310
Thank you

582
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,640
Just so so

583
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,610
For this time, do you have anything to ask?

584
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,510
I have found the answer

585
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,140
Thank you for taking this photo

586
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,390
He should remain where it was

587
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,690
Then you...

588
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,390
We'll have more photos

589
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:11,760
Thank you

590
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,910
It's really precious today

591
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,510
You asked me out

592
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:37,260
Have a seat

593
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,390
Maybe

594
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,890
this is the last time

595
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,860
How is that?

596
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,040
If you are still unhappy

597
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,860
for the photo

598
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,510
I will apologize to you

599
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,090
Zhen Nian

600
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,560
How long have we known each other?

601
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,740
Five years

602
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,090
We have known each other for five years, Jingzhi

603
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,310
I know

604
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,960
I cannot replace the one in your heart

605
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,910
But I think we can still be friends

606
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,640
To be exact

607
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,340
We have known each other for six years

608
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,290
Haven't we?

609
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,740
Nie Xingchen has told you?

610
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,960
She didn't say anything

611
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,910
But I found you were college classmates

612
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,840
when I was discovering the past between I and her

613
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:49,860
Sorry!

614
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,090
I didn't mean to offend your privacy

615
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,110
But you are blaming me, aren't you?

616
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,210
For I didn't tell you earlier

617
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,880
Or you don't need to

618
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,590
separate from her for so many years

619
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,560
I did blame you when I first knew it

620
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,460
But it is you who let me know

621
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,190
Even if I lost my memory

622
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,210
I will fall in love with her

623
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,540
Am I funny?

624
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,290
I tried so hard for so many years

625
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,340
But I fail completely in the last

626
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,410
You didn't fail

627
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,060
Just going on a wrong direction

628
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,010
Zhen Nian

629
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,060
Thank you

630
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,890
very much

631
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,110
But I am not your Mr. Right

632
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,510
You can find the real happiness belongs to you

633
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,010
I wonder

634
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,910
why it can't be me

635
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,960
or others

636
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,540
But only Nie Xingchen

637
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,260
There are trillions of stars in the universe

638
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,310
But no matter how the earth turns

639
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,140
The position of the Plough will never move

640
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,790
In my universe,

641
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,810
she is the Plough

642
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:27,590
Thank you

643
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,340
I'm leaving

644
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,540
Wait

645
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,860
I have a last request

646
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,060
For this time

647
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,340
I don't want to see you leave first

648
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:57,560
Hey

649
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,290
Mr. Zhao

650
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,160
Miss Zhen Nian

651
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,110
is going to cancel all contracts with Bojue Group

652
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,390
I see

653
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:04,460
Block the news first

654
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,260
Wait for my assignment

655
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:05,890
OK

656
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:17,910
Sorry

657
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,210
The subscriber you dialed can not be connected for the moment

658
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,510
What's the problem for the big star?

659
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:45,940
Hello, Miss Nie

660
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,860
I am the photographer Xiaowu of Bojue Tourism Shooting

661
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,760
Is here the space for your shooting?

662
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:52,860
Yeah

663
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:55,110
I think there can be two camera positions high up there

664
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:56,460
That's OK

665
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,960
I will place a camera on the second floor

666
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,260
to cover the scope of entry

667
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,310
Is this OK?

668
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,140
OK

669
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,090
Have a camera to make high angle shoot

670
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,390
Ok, I will watch it

671
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:05,210
Ok, thanks

672
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:05,840
OK

673
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,690
Mr. Zhang

674
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:14,710
This afternoon...

675
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:17,540
Where are you?

676
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,810
Do you think it is appropriate for making proposal here?

677
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,460
You have prepared so well

678
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,990
I believe Miss Ye will definitely love it

679
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:17,960
And you?

680
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:20,510
I...

681
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:24,810
I hope you can be happy

682
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,690
Only you can

683
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:29,590
give me happiness

684
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,740
Today there is no Miss Ye

685
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:35,510
Only Miss Nie

686
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,460
Sir

687
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,190
You don't live here?

688
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:53,290
Yes

689
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,810
I often see your car here

690
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,210
My girlfriend lives here

691
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,610
Then I suggest

692
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:58,660
you'd better apply a parking card

693
00:46:58,910 --> 00:46:59,560
How to have it?

694
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,210
We have difference cards

695
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,090
For month card, season card, and year card

696
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:02,710
Year card

697
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:03,360
Ok

698
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,460
How about the parking space?

699
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,810
Let's talk in the office
