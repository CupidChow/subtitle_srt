1
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,750
What are you doing?

2
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,100
How can Xingchen be a business spy?

3
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:44,920
Yes!

4
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,170
Did you mistake it?

5
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,950
How could the boss investigate on Xingchen?

6
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,200
All right! All right! All right!

7
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,220
Secretary Jin

8
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,650
I, Huang Tao, guarantee with personalities

9
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,450
of all person in PO

10
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,970
Secretary Nie would definitely not betray our company

11
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,950
Except Mr. Yan, Secretary Nie

12
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,820
is the only one who has contacted the full scheme

13
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,020
I am just doing my job

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,470
Later I will invite you to cope with investigation

15
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,300
Secretary Nie

16
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,100
Please follow me

17
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,270
Don't worry, guys

18
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,950
I also want to figure out

19
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,300
the one stealing scheme

20
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,450
Secretary Nie

21
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,700
If you have no question on

22
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,800
the above content,

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,570
please sign here

24
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,300
Can I leave now?

25
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,420
A minute please

26
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,800
We must report to Mr. Yan first

27
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,370
The ones who can really work well in Jinghai

28
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,220
must be us,

29
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,850
the well-established domestic companies

30
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,170
What do you mean, Mr. Liu?

31
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,300
Soon you will know it

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,070
Mr. Yan

33
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,220
So it turns about that this is his purpose

34
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,850
I should have thought of it earlier

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,070
Think of what?

36
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,200
Mr. Yan

37
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,120
Why don't you answer my question?

38
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,000
Now telling the truth will make it harder to explain

39
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,220
I should have prepared two schemes

40
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,500
to cope with the accident situation

41
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,970
With two schemes,

42
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,420
we will still have the same result

43
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,350
Why?

44
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,150
Then why do you want to go back to

45
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,300
PO with all your efforts?

46
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,450
For you

47
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,750
Good acting, Secretary Nie

48
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,950
I nearly believed you

49
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,850
What do you mean?

50
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,220
You are approaching me

51
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,170
in the name of loving me

52
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,520
A spy

53
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,250
Spy?

54
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,900
You mean, I'm the spy?

55
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,850
Or just make a quick repeat

56
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,770
of what did you say to Mr. Liu

57
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,250
on the day of that meeting?

58
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,620
If I say that

59
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,170
I just say hello to him,

60
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,670
you will also not believe it

61
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,450
I only believe what I see

62
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,500
and what I reasoned out logically

63
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,350
But reasoning is not equal to evidence

64
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,470
Since there is no evidence

65
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,850
that I am the one who stole the scheme,

66
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,070
then I have the right

67
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,450
to catch time to prove my innocence

68
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,020
Before the formal signing between Hengji and Xuhui,

69
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,050
I'll try to make it up

70
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:06,800
By you?

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,920
By me

72
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,070
OK

73
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,370
Five days

74
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,900
I'll give you five days

75
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,070
If you cannot do it...

76
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,450
I will voluntarily resign

77
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,100
Director Huang

78
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,120
I need several days break

79
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,620
Secretary Nie

80
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,500
We all trust you are innocence

81
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,050
Once the investigation is clear,

82
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,920
everything will return

83
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,970
Don't blame yourself

84
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,920
Yes, Xingchen

85
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,550
We are all on your side

86
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,620
Don't worry

87
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,900
No one can frame me for

88
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,450
what I didn't do

89
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,600
I don't know why

90
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,200
I just believe Secretary Nie

91
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,970
She can do what she says

92
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,470
Hello

93
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,720
I am Nie Xingchen from PO of Bojue Group

94
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,720
I have something important to talk to Mr. Liao

95
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,450
Have you made an appointment?

96
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,670
No

97
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,300
I'm sorry, Miss Nie

98
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,320
I cannot let you in without an appointment

99
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,500
Can I wait for him there?

100
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,250
OK!

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,920
Mr. Liao

102
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,200
Mr. Liao, I...

103
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,170
Sorry

104
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,470
Mr. Liao is not available now

105
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,670
Nobody can make me lose

106
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,070
unless I don't want to win

107
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,150
Mr. Yan

108
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,150
The news from Technology Department

109
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,650
They restore Secretary Nie's

110
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,870
Email history

111
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,520
They found out that

112
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,750
her computer did send out the scheme before

113
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,050
OK

114
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,950
Do we need to take some measures?

115
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,800
Leave it to me

116
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,150
I will deal with it myself

117
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,920
Yes

118
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,850
Do I need to help you make an appointment to visit President Xie?

119
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,100
When did I say that

120
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,920
I would go to the bank for a loan?

121
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,370
Most funds of this company

122
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,350
has been invested in Hengji project

123
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
If the fund cannot be replenished in time,

124
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,150
it may cause difficulties to the turnover

125
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,850
The first lesson that my father taught me when I was a child

126
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,550
is never put all your eggs in one basket

127
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,620
I have informed the headquarters in the USA

128
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,800
Recently a fund would be transferred

129
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,420
to make up

130
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,950
Secretary Jin

131
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,650
If there is nothing else,

132
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,070
you can get off work ahead today

133
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,370
Yes

134
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,400
Miss Nie

135
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,020
Miss Nie

136
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,620
Miss Nie, it's already ten o'clock

137
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,470
Will you...

138
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,320
Then...where's Mr. Liao?

139
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,200
Mr. Liao has already left from the reserved passage

140
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,470
He let me tell you

141
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,770
This time Hengji has chosen the objective to sign with

142
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,550
He just hopes to cooperate with your company for the next time

143
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,870
In addition,

144
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,170
you don't need to come tomorrow

145
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,720
He won't see you

146
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,570
It seems she has a guilty conscience

147
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,150
Hello, Miss

148
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,800
Can I help you?

149
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,950
I am here for a friend

150
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,320
Where does he live?

151
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,170
Then I want to ask about

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,100
Mr. Liao, Liao Zhigao of Hengji Real Estate

153
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,550
Does he live here?

154
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,370
What's your purpose?

155
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,670
He is the big client of our company

156
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,500
I want to visit him

157
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,820
Sorry!

158
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,620
We have a regulation that

159
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,820
people are not allowed to go in casually

160
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,850
Or

161
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,150
you may let Mr. Liao come out and pick you up

162
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,770
or let he call us

163
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,670
Then I can let you in

164
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,950
OK

165
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,450
He does live here

166
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,300
I just wanna see

167
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,820
how long can you hide from me

168
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,600
I am so thirsty

169
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,600
Aunt, this is my water

170
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:37,870
Aunt

171
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,500
Who are you calling aunt?

172
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,700
I am just twenty-three!

173
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,650
Are you living here?

174
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,370
No

175
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,650
I don't live here

176
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,150
I live in Heshan in the east of the city

177
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,950
Then you come here for...

178
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,850
Yes

179
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,070
Why did I come here?

180
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,700
Where is it?

181
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,020
Aunt

182
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,770
I am just going to Heshan too

183
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,600
Let me send you back home

184
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,550
Really?

185
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,320
I gotta go home now

186
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,800
I have to cook for my husband

187
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,000
Why are you out alone?

188
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,350
Dose she live here?

189
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,320
She seems lost

190
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,800
Yes, yes, she lives here

191
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:21,920
Could you

192
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,370
please take care of her for me just a minute

193
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,650
I will call her family to pick her up

194
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,090
OK

195
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,000
Thank you

196
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,870
Where am I?

197
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,470
It's not Heshan

198
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,720
It's not Heshan

199
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,050
It's not Heshan

200
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,720
Where am I?

201
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,270
How long will it be before we leave?

202
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,750
I can't wait for it

203
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,970
Soon

204
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,250
The car will come in a minute

205
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,050
Let's take a taxi back later

206
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,050
I'm sure we can get home before your husband gets off work

207
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,400
Let's take back all

208
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,970
the hamburgers

209
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,270
to your husband

210
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,450
Yes, take them back

211
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,120
Can you remember the concrete address of your family?

212
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,570
Yes

213
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,150
Wutong Road, Heshan in the east of the city

214
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,850
Turn right at the second crossing

215
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,500
The first house is my home

216
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,050
Yunhua

217
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,170
Who are you?

218
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,320
I am Zhigao

219
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,120
Look at me

220
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,200
Oh, Zhigao

221
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,100
Why are you back from work so early?

222
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,800
I haven't cooked the dinner

223
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,170
You

224
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,070
forget it again

225
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,970
It's my turn today

226
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,770
Today Liu will cook

227
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,820
She will?

228
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,800
Mr. Liao

229
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,500
I tell you

230
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,800
When you are out

231
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,100
You must let Liu go with you and watch over her

232
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,050
Don't make her get lost

233
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,190
Or she will be worried

234
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:22,870
You know?

235
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,700
When she is worried, I get worried too

236
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,670
You know?

237
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,350
Good

238
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,350
Do you want apples?

239
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,750
No

240
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,500
I want to sleep

241
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:35,630
Sleep

242
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,260
OK

243
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,620
Come on

244
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,270
Let's go to sleep

245
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,820
Slow down, slow down

246
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,220
Chen

247
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,050
Help madam get in

248
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,550
OK

249
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,450
Madam

250
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,650
Be slow

251
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,370
Sorry

252
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,450
Come on and have a seat

253
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,450
Miss Nie

254
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,170
Thank you very much for today

255
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,420
It's okay!

256
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,720
I also happened to meet

257
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,650
May I ask

258
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,820
why she...?

259
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,720
Alzheimer

260
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,270
It's been nearly five years

261
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,100
This morning, the nurse went for a walk with her

262
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,070
But she disappeared soon

263
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,670
It's lucky that you met her

264
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,020
Or, I don't really know

265
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,300
where she would go today

266
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,450
I heard from her that

267
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,400
she wants to go to Heshan

268
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,900
Heshan

269
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,050
Our first home was in Heshan

270
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,850
That must be a happy time there

271
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,120
So she would always remember that

272
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,520
How to say

273
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,500
In fact in that time,

274
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,050
our life was the most miserable

275
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,800
My wife used to grow up and be cherished

276
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,270
in a rich family

277
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,300
However, she fell in love with me, a poor lad

278
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,950
After marriage,

279
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,850
she lived with me in an old house

280
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,220
She does housework everyday

281
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,350
and takes care of the family

282
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,100
We were really poor then

283
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,320
The happiest thing was

284
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,770
listening to the video and dancing under the star sky

285
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,220
After she was ill,

286
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,920
she can't remember many things

287
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,250
and cannot recognize people

288
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,150
But she remembers our old house

289
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,200
Miss Nie

290
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,520
Personally,

291
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,270
I'm very grateful to you

292
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,220
today

293
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,220
But I think

294
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,820
business is business

295
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,820
Since we

296
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,850
have made an oral agreement with Xuhui,

297
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,550
we should not change for no reason

298
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,550
Mr. Liao

299
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,900
Our company is very sincere

300
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,020
to take this land

301
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,850
In fact

302
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,900
Mr. Yan didn't try to work for the land

303
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,070
because our scheme was

304
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,250
copied by Xuhui

305
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,720
You mean...

306
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,600
That's right

307
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,350
Xuhui's scheme

308
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,970
is the same with ours

309
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,850
Mr. Liao

310
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,370
For such a company that steals secrets from other companies

311
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,700
It has no credit or bottom lines

312
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,750
Please reconsider about it

313
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,570
Then

314
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,420
Do you have evidence to prove it?

315
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,570
There is no evidence yet

316
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,370
Well, young lady

317
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,550
I can't base on your single word

318
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,820
to cancel such a great decision

319
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,420
I know, Mr. Liao

320
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:06,800
But

321
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,670
Miss Nie

322
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,950
Don't worry

323
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,150
I believe even if you don't convince me today

324
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,320
Your boyfriend will not push the responsibility

325
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,820
on to you

326
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,670
Also

327
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,400
I like your dance

328
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,170
One day, if you get married,

329
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,420
please remember to invite me to your wedding

330
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,820
Mr. Liao, I am really not...

331
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,570
Sorry

332
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,100
I have to go upstairs to accompany with my wife

333
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,650
Thank you

334
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,040
Wutong Road, Heshan in the east of the city

335
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,540
Turn right at the second crossing

336
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,810
The first house is my home

337
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,560
It's within the scope of the land to be transferred

338
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,960
Mr. Yan

339
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,460
Anything else?

340
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,460
Secretary Nie didn't come to work today

341
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,190
Director Huang said she was on leave

342
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,290
I just think she...

343
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,540
You think she ran away for fear of her fault?

344
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,660
I don't mean this

345
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,240
But the gossips in the company...

346
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,210
If you don't handle it well,

347
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,660
it will have a bad effect

348
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,110
on the company

349
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,360
or on Secretary Nie

350
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,160
I know

351
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,060
You can go

352
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,260
Hey

353
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,590
You didn't come to the company today?

354
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,160
You promised me for five days

355
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,490
Yesterday the Technology Department

356
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,490
restored your email records

357
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,910
They are sure that you once sent out the scheme

358
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,290
So you have changed your mind?

359
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,710
You are going to condemn me?

360
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,210
You behavior to guess others' mind casually

361
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,610
seems not smart

362
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,440
especially when you guess wrong

363
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,660
Since not,

364
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,990
then what do you want to do?

365
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,510
I want to know your plan

366
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,510
It seems that you have

367
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,360
a well-thought-out plan yesterday

368
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,940
Won't you tell me there's no plan at all?

369
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,140
Yes, I have

370
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,410
My plan is working

371
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,060
as the situation changes

372
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,710
Where are you right now?

373
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,990
Heshan

374
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,340
Why are you there at this time?

375
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,140
Mr. Yan

376
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,990
Since you don't want to take the promise back,

377
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,590
then I hope you can leave me alone on my own stuff

378
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,840
in the five days

379
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,110
I will see and do it, OK?

380
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,140
If you are afraid that I may run away

381
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,160
I can remind you that

382
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,960
there is the shared position in your phone

383
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,790
That's it

384
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,690
That's your attitude to talk with your boss?

385
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,410
Sorry

386
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,410
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment,

387
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,040
please redial later

388
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,240
Shared position?

389
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,010
Yan Jingzhi

390
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,060
I have called you for dozens of time

391
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,240
Why don't you pick up?

392
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,660
No signal

393
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,440
Also power off?

394
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,290
So what?

395
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,740
What the hell is going in your mind?

396
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,340
You are in such a poor lonely place in such a distance

397
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,190
This is the first house of Mr. Liao

398
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,910
I think here

399
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,910
I may find

400
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,440
the way to change his mind

401
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,110
Who told you this?

402
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,460
Intuition

403
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,890
Why are you here to find me in such a rain?

404
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,510
I am afraid you will be in danger

405
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,410
The company has to pay for your stupidity

406
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,910
Didn't you watch the climate report before you went out?

407
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,990
I went out in the morning

408
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,310
How can I have to time to check

409
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,260
What did you say?

410
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,810
I mean let's leave!

411
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,140
Where's your car?

412
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,410
The road condition is bad

413
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,440
The tire blew out

414
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,310
Then did you call the trailer?

415
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,810
Of course not

416
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,540
Now we cannot find a taxi

417
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,260
We'll have to stay here tonight

418
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,210
Nie Xingchen

419
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,490
If you can be a little bit smarter

420
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,210
and a little bit more careful,

421
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,240
we wouldn't have come to this

422
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,460
I only thought your are not qualified,

423
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,210
I didn't think that you are so careless

424
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:35,840
Careless

425
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,060
All right! All right! All right!

426
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,860
Stop complaining about me

427
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,740
Or you will have hypoglycemia

428
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,440
Or take off your coat

429
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:56,590
It's all wet

430
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,940
Or you'll catch a cold

431
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,560
What do you what to do?

432
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,590
Though now only we two are here

433
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,860
Don't even think about doing something to me

434
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,490
Or I will terminate the contract with you immediately

435
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,660
I will expel you tomorrow

436
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,360
Then the chips?

437
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,940
Eat them yourself

438
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,660
If you have hypoglycemia, I cannot carry you

439
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,160
Sit

440
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,940
Actually, I just found out today that Mrs. Liao,

441
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,810
who can dance Tango very well,

442
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,590
has Alzheimer's disease

443
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,540
Now she even cannot remember

444
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,160
Mr. Liao

445
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,090
Just like you could not remember me

446
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,560
In fact, I also hesitate that

447
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,860
if you always cannot remember me

448
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,790
and hate me,

449
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,660
then what's the point for me to accompany with you?

450
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,340
To move myself?

451
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,690
But today after seeing Mr. Liao

452
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,510
I can see that not all efforts can bring good results

453
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,260
and not everything

454
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,860
has to be meaningful

455
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,340
Nie Xingchen

456
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,360
What?

457
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,310
A bit moved?

458
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,460
Are you in love with me?

459
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,660
I just wanna ask you

460
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,310
have we ever taken

461
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,810
pictures together before

462
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,390
You finally remember it?

463
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,960
Just some fragments

464
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,310
Did you take your wallet?

465
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,060
Why didn't you take pictures to

466
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,010
prove our relationship

467
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,490
At the beginning, I forgot it

468
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,060
Latter, I remembered it

469
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,440
But I thought a picture doesn't make sense

470
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,410
After all, you will not fall in love with me

471
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,710
for a picture

472
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,910
It does make sense

473
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,090
It seems the rain is getting lighter

474
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,360
I don't know when it would stop

475
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,490
Or we can see stars in the countryside

476
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,510
I will send my position to you

477
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,110
Just pick us according to the position

478
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,160
OK

479
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,810
Morning

480
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,690
I have sent the position to the driver

481
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,040
He will pick us up after a while

482
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,640
We can just go to the main road first

483
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,810
It is so beautiful here

484
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,640
Now can you tell me

485
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,860
your plan?

486
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,260
As far as I know

487
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,910
Our company

488
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,140
buys this land

489
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,690
to build a

490
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,960
resort area

491
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,760
Yes

492
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,940
The natural environment of the Heshan is great

493
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,460
with abundant tourism resources

494
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,540
There is a Meihu Lake

495
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,690
with beautiful scenery

496
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,810
But few people know this place

497
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,610
Maybe

498
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,910
this can be a romantic place

499
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,190
in the tourist area

500
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,890
You mean...

501
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,610
What can be more moving

502
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,240
than a real loving story

503
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,260
You want to make another scheme?

504
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,090
A scheme is limited on a few pieces of paper

505
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,940
It is far less shocking than seeing it with your eyes

506
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,460
If you agree,

507
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,810
I want to repair this place

508
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,160
as soon as possible

509
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,760
OK

510
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,210
But in order not to deliberately create such problems,

511
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,890
you have to follow up the repair yourself

512
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,090
It's OK

513
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,290
If that still doesn't

514
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,140
impress Liao Zhigao...

515
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,840
Admit defeat for bet then

516
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,840
I will be responsible for it

517
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,510
This is betting with your reputation in this industry

518
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,760
I believe I will win

519
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,790
Just like believing one day

520
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,810
you will remember me

521
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:17,960
I will wait and see

522
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,110
Wish you won't let me down

523
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,040
Mr. Liao

524
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,260
Let's sign

525
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,390
Wait a minute

526
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,840
What do you mean, Mr. Yan?

527
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,310
I have brought a new scheme

528
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,840
Mr. Liao, please have a look

529
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,290
Mr. Yan

530
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,240
Mr. Liao has promised to transfer the land to Xuhui

531
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,090
First come first served

532
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,540
I think you should know that

533
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,660
Since you have not signed,

534
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,810
Mr. Liao has the right to change his mind at any time

535
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,740
We have a very good scheme

536
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,040
After reading it, Mr. Liao can make a decision

537
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,840
Yan Jingzhi

538
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,810
Do you still respect the rules of business?

539
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,690
Mr. Liu knows to respect the rules now?

540
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,160
Er...

541
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,690
The scheme can be stole by people

542
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,140
But our sincerity cannot be stolen

543
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,140
Mr. Liao, I'd like you to come with me to a place

544
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,810
and see our sincerity

545
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,410
If you are still not satisfied then,

546
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,710
you can come back and sign the contract

547
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:32,660
Now we...

548
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,660
Wutong Road, Heshan

549
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,390
Wutong Road

550
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,910
Mr. Liao

551
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,140
Mr. Liu

552
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,540
Sorry

553
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,640
I think that

554
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,160
Mr. Yan is right

555
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,060
Before I sign the contract,

556
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,560
I have the right to change my mind

557
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,990
But don't worry

558
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,460
I'm just going to check it

559
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,840
Please wait for me for a moment

560
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,910
It's not appropriate, Mr. Liao!

561
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,410
Yunhua

562
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,640
Zhigao

563
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,560
Why are you here?

564
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,460
They brought me here

565
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,090
Sorry, Mr. Liao

566
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,790
I took Mrs. Liao out

567
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,160
without your permission

568
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,840
I heard the house from Mrs. Liao

569
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,390
She seemed quite miss it

570
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,860
So this is your new scheme?

571
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,040
Yes

572
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,040
Last time, I heard the story of you and your wife

573
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,160
I was moved deeply

574
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,110
I came over here and made an investigation

575
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,740
I found this old house

576
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,660
borders Meihu Lake on the left

577
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,760
and Yushan Mountain on the right

578
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,540
It's in the middle of the Heshan

579
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,610
After we learned that,

580
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,710
Mr. Yan decided to build it into a romantic place

581
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,360
for lovers in the tourist area

582
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,810
We believe

583
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,690
In the future couples visiting the tourist area

584
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,260
will come here and have a look at this

585
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,510
place full of romance

586
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,940
You and your wife can also come over from time to time

587
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,360
for memories of your past

588
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,710
You really want to preserve it?

589
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,290
We have done this,

590
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:42,390
haven't we?

591
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,210
Have a cordial working relationship

592
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,590
Come on

593
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,860
Sister Xingchen

594
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,790
I know you can do it!

595
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,640
Secretary Nie

596
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,790
I have to criticize you really seriously

597
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,590
You have accomplished such a great job

598
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,760
without telling us

599
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,560
I just worried about you every day

600
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,440
Look at the white hair on my head

601
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,260
Much more

602
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,210
You owe me a bottle of hairdressing gel

603
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,640
Ok, Ok

604
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,590
Secretary Nie

605
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,840
Well done this time

606
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,240
I'd like to thank Mr. Yan for giving me this opportunity

607
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,440
I was out of the office these days

608
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,390
Thank you

609
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,910
That's my job

610
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:42,840
I'll ask the Technology Department to

611
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,440
return your computer

612
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,590
Ok, thanks

613
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,740
Okay! Okay!

614
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,290
Let's get to work!

615
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,760
You owe me a bottle of hairdressing gel

616
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,910
OK

617
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,440
Secretary Nie

618
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,040
You've been working so hard these days.

619
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,590
Go back to have a good rest

620
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,660
I'm OK

621
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,810
Nie Xingchen

622
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,760
Sorry

623
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,910
I'm sorry I misunderstood you

624
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,190
Which one do you mean?

625
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,040
You got me wrong

626
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,440
a lot

627
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,390
You harassed me

628
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,490
And now you admit that I am your girlfriend?

629
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,990
I just confirmed it

630
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,060
But whether we will continue to be together

631
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,210
I'll have to think about it

632
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:54,740
If you want to break up

633
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,090
I will say no now!

634
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,360
You don't like others

635
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,540
Why can't you be with me again?

636
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,090
Let's discuss it later

637
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,390
You can get off work

638
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,240
Person I like...

639
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,260
Zhao Yuanfang

640
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,540
What's up?

641
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,590
Lower your voice

642
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,440
You miss me so much?

643
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,960
I miss you too

644
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,940
Stop it

645
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,060
Great

646
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,110
Nice house

647
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,810
Elite housing

648
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,660
Yan Jingzhi just did a right thing

649
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,860
before losing his memory

650
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,940
Good house

651
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:58,540
Why are you here without my permission?

652
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,740
Come on, we are friends

653
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,290
No, I have told you

654
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,240
Yan Jingzhi just lives in the next door

655
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,210
If he knows this, it's over

656
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,210
OK, Ok

657
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,290
But he doesn't know you live here

658
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,510
I just want to congratulate you. Why sneak around?

659
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,190
For what?

660
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,240
Because you got the project

661
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,310
with your efforts

662
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,060
You are really the one that I chose

663
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,090
Good job

664
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,390
I haven't told this to company

665
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,440
How do you know it?

666
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:26,140
I met Director Huang when I was off duty

667
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,540
You know him

668
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:29,510
No wonder

669
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,510
I have prepared wine and food

670
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,490
Let's drink till all's blue

671
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,960
You wish!

672
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,090
But you must

673
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,540
go back home

674
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,710
That doesn't matter

675
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,760
Yan Jingzhi

676
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,340
has taken a shine to you,

677
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,690
his neighbor like a stalker

678
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,010
Who is stalker?

679
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,810
Then I ask you

680
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,640
If there is

681
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,990
someone who knows your habits and hobbies very well,

682
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,560
would you fall in love?

683
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,390
That's impossible

684
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,640
But he even hasn't seen my face

685
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,890
He said that we seem to have met before

686
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,360
But if I look ugly?

687
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,510
Nie Xingchen

688
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,110
Are you crazy?

689
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,660
You are even envious of yourself?

690
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,920
Your favorite

691
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:57,410
White peach flavor

692
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,290
Cheers!

693
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,590
Oh my god

694
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:11,660
Who's that?

695
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,560
Don't talk, don't talk

696
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,560
Keep silent

697
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,740
What are you doing?

698
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,310
Zhao Yuanfang

699
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,360
Hello, property management

700
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,240
Oh

701
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,710
Property management?

702
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:30,260
Go away

703
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:32,110
Hello, come in, sir

704
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:32,810
Ok, Ok

705
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:33,790
We won't bother our neighbor

706
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:37,990
What's the matter?

707
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:38,810
Hello

708
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,360
I am the worker of property management

709
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,890
We are going to select the members of

710
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:42,860
owners' committee

711
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,960
We hope all owners can vote

712
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,990
This is the list of candidates

713
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:46,810
Please have a look

714
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:47,890
Pen

715
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,460
I don't know all of them

716
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,340
It doesn't matter

717
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,240
You can choose any one

718
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:02,960
Thank you

719
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,040
Wish you a happy life

720
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,760
That's right, sir

721
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,660
Have some together

722
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,310
No, no

723
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:08,790
Enjoy yourself

724
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:09,990
What do you want to do?

725
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,310
I won't bother you

726
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,960
Close the door, sir!

727
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:13,660
OK

728
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:15,690
Come on

729
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:16,610
Let go

730
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:19,660
Did I let you open the door?

731
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,640
That's not good

732
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,710
He is just a worker

733
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,240
Come in

734
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,660
What

735
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,490
did you see?

736
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,490
There is a man in the room

737
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,990
Before I came in, they were eating Barbecue,

738
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,510
and drinking Rio

739
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,360
Drink with a man at home at night

740
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,440
What does she want?

741
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:43,390
Mr. Yan

742
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:44,360
I also saw

743
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,290
that man is feeding the lady food

744
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,440
May be a couple

745
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,360
You work is finished

746
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,660
Please go out and close the door

747
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,360
Ok

748
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,660
If it's really like what you said,

749
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,340
this house means a lot to Liao Zhigao

750
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,640
He won't easily sell it

751
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,090
And

752
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:59,160
Nie Xingchen

753
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:01,690
I forgot you

754
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,640
Sorry
