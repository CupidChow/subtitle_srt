1
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,370
I have noticed the place on the Internet

2
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,520
But it's too hot

3
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,790
I had been unable to order a seat

4
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,220
But why is it empty today?

5
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,770
I have invested in this restaurant

6
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,940
I make a block booking today

7
00:01:59,390 --> 00:01:59,990
Take a seat, please

8
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,740
Thank you

9
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,990
What do you want to order?

10
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,540
Why shall I love you only

11
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,690
I mean the name of the set meal

12
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,240
I want to be with you

13
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,770
What do you want drink then?

14
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,940
This, I only have a feeling for you

15
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,020
Okay. That's it

16
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,420
The menu is so strange

17
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,820
It's not like this when I saw it on the Internet

18
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,470
It's customized for us

19
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,140
This is their specialty

20
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,320
You can try

21
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,240
Thank you

22
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Mr. Yan, you're wired today

23
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,470
You've had a long flight these days

24
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,470
Today is for you to take a relax

25
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,140
You are so kind

26
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,290
It's my duty to help you

27
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,920
How do you like the UAV show today?

28
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,640
It was brilliant. Shocking

29
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,690
It was a feast for eyes

30
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,420
If someone tells you that he like you in this way

31
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,620
Would you like that?

32
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,190
Someone gave me

33
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,540
such a advertising planning

34
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,470
And I want to hear what girls think about it

35
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,690
I think somebody will like it

36
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,970
And the idea of the first snow is wonderful

37
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,020
It's romantic

38
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,070
What about you? Will you like it?

39
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,990
I think relationship is about two people

40
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,920
It will be awkward if there are somebody else

41
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,290
Just like two animals being watched by visitors

42
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,090
Excuse me, I have to go to the rest room

43
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,070
I don't need it anymore

44
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,020
Cancel it now

45
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,190
Are you okay, Mr. Yan?

46
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,290
Actually, I have also worked in restaurant

47
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,270
when I was a college student

48
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,870
Be a waitress?

49
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,690
Yes

50
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,740
My parents told me that

51
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,290
if I want to stay in Jinghai,

52
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,490
I have to earn money and buy a house by myself

53
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,320
Or else, I have to obey their wish

54
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,990
and go back to my hometown for work

55
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,020
Why?

56
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,170
They thought Jinghai is too far away

57
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,370
with a high house price

58
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,640
The job is full of uncertainty

59
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,490
So they still want me to go back

60
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,890
It seems that all parents

61
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,490
under heaven are all controlling

62
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,820
Would you like to stay beside me?

63
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,820
I mean

64
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,120
continue to work for me

65
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,770
Mr. Yan

66
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,720
I have talked about that today

67
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,220
It's getting late

68
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,420
Shall I drive you home?

69
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,840
I haven't finished my dinner

70
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,870
"Why shall I love you only" hasn't come yet

71
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,120
I have work to do

72
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,570
It's for you

73
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,720
It suits you

74
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,820
It's my responsibility to do the work well

75
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,320
You don't need to give me bonus

76
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,920
You know my feeling

77
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,490
They are all excuses

78
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,790
I don't know

79
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,090
And I don't want to know

80
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,170
There is only a few day left

81
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,220
for me to work in the company

82
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,240
Even if you left

83
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,820
I can still show you my feeling

84
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,170
Haven't you said that you don't like to be watched

85
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,220
when someone is confessing his love for you?

86
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,640
Now it's only two of us

87
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,420
Please stop, Mr. Yan

88
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,020
I like you

89
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,290
Mr. Yan

90
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,090
We haven't known each other for long

91
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,890
No matter how do you feel about me

92
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,690
I believe it's just the heat of the moment

93
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,190
We will keep our relationship as colleagues

94
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,670
And days after, we will be nothing

95
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:12,990
Goodbye

96
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,970
Nie Xingchen

97
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,070
You understand me so well

98
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,970
You should know

99
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,120
that I will stop at nothing to achieve his objective

100
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,290
You think I'm kidding?

101
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,690
I understand you

102
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,040
But it seems you don't understand me well

103
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,390
In terms or willpower

104
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,390
We are exactly the same

105
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,420
So what should I do

106
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,020
to make you my girlfriend?

107
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,790
Pick for me a real star

108
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,620
It's too late

109
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,520
You should go back

110
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,770
Real star

111
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,570
I like you

112
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,620
Miss Xingchen

113
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,890
I can't find the link that can get coupon

114
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,290
you have mentioned last time

115
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,820
Wait a minute

116
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,670
I will send it to you

117
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,320
I want to go the game room

118
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,690
and play all the games one by one

119
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,590
Mr. Yan

120
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,920
You said that you had work to do, didn't you?

121
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,490
I'm working here, too

122
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,690
Yeah

123
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,620
I ate too much just now

124
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,340
You, as my secretary

125
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,690
should help me to digest

126
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,890
Keeping my fit every moment

127
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,440
is also you duty, right?

128
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,620
Yan Jingzhi

129
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:28,840
Mr. Yan

130
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,190
What?

131
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,240
I won't play with you

132
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,270
Why?

133
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,570
No one will like to play games

134
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,090
that he or she aren't good at

135
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:38,640
Okay

136
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,690
What are you good at?

137
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,670
I will play with you

138
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,440
Mr. Yan

139
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,120
What gift have you got?

140
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,890
What are you laughing at？

141
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,990
The game is not finished

142
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,290
It's just the beginning

143
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,820
So many

144
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,220
Which one do you like?

145
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,220
It's difficult

146
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,590
It's OK

147
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,420
Look at me

148
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,090
We got it!

149
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,420
Huh...

150
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,990
Awesome?

151
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,520
Am I awesome?

152
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,370
Yes

153
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,470
Mr. Yan

154
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,490
But I have to tell you

155
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,170
that the money you used just now

156
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,270
has greatly exceeded the value of these two

157
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,070
Never mind

158
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,220
The process is important

159
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,420
You take this

160
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,340
I don't need it anymore

161
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,090
I already have one

162
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,240
You take this

163
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,190
This is ugly

164
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Let it be here

165
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,840
The bear is like secretary Nie

166
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,670
Challenge my dignity time and time again

167
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,990
But I'm the only winner

168
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,220
It's an another hot restaurant

169
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,970
I shall visit it later

170
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,070
Wait for me

171
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,290
Hi, Jim

172
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,070
I'm Yan

173
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,540
I wish you can do me a favor that

174
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,420
Coule you help me to contact with

175
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,890
IAU?

176
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,870
Good morning

177
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,270
Morning, Miss Xingchen

178
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,070
Morning, director Huang

179
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,020
Secretary Nie

180
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,620
You had a nice day yesterday, didn't you?

181
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,540
What do you mean?

182
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,720
I don't understand

183
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,290
You are pretending

184
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,720
With me?

185
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,270
The boss kept you late specially

186
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,440
to invite you for dinner, right?

187
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,840
I know it

188
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,790
He let me

189
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,220
to lie to you

190
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,840
He said there was a surprise

191
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,390
Huh...

192
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,220
Was the restaurant luxurious?

193
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,690
Did he send you other gifts?

194
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,490
Secretary Nie

195
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,490
Listen to my suggestion

196
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,420
You should not quit the job

197
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,970
Mr. Yan is really nice

198
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,340
to you

199
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,170
You will have a bright future

200
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,890
Miss Xingchen

201
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,570
I brought two cups of milk in the morning

202
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,340
You take it

203
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,140
Hey

204
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,420
Where are my milk?

205
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,390
It's good for girl to drink milk

206
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,090
You

207
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,490
You should drink wolfberry tea

208
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,220
Miss Xingchen

209
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,520
If you like it,

210
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,240
I can buy you every day from today on

211
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,790
You are so kind

212
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,090
Secretary Nie

213
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,640
Get ready

214
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,690
We will go to the sales office

215
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,240
Secretary Sun is writing the annual report, right?

216
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,540
Mr. Yan

217
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,490
He is good at writing

218
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,420
I hope the report will be on my desk

219
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,370
before I'm off work

220
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,220
Director Huang

221
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,640
Did I hear it right?

222
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,240
I thought the annual report is due next month

223
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,540
You need it this evening?

224
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,220
It's a little early, right

225
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,070
But boss will never do

226
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,040
wrong decisions

227
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,690
Hurry up

228
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,090
Hurry! Okay!

229
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,720
We still rank first in the turnover

230
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,120
of real estate last month

231
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,420
Especially among females

232
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,120
The turnover reached 47%

233
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,090
The purchase proportion of single female over 30

234
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,440
is increasing year by year

235
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,090
The purchase proportion of single female youth

236
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,720
Yes

237
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,620
We have done researches over these

238
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,620
Most females today think

239
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,420
house is more reliable

240
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,620
compared to a boyfriend or a marriage

241
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,140
I heard that secretary Nie is waiting for the company's welfare house

242
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,940
She must understand that feeling

243
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,740
Welfare house indicator

244
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,090
Right

245
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,290
Not long ago, secretary Nie came to see the house

246
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,090
Okay

247
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,890
Go do you work

248
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,820
Okay

249
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,740
So you suddenly stayed to hand over the work

250
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,690
just for the house?

251
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,920
Now that you know it

252
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,540
It seems that I won't get the house

253
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,770
Not for sure

254
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,570
if you change you mind

255
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,220
and stay in the company

256
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,540
Bojue makes no exception

257
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,590
on all the employees

258
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,720
Or...

259
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,340
you can...

260
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:01,970
No need to bother

261
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,090
It's my fault to targeting at the house

262
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,620
And I should have done the handover

263
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,540
a month in advance

264
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,290
Now it's almost the time

265
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,940
I have basically finished my work

266
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,170
You haven't listen to the other scheme!

267
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
I only know that

268
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,020
there is no such a thing as free lunch

269
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,020
If there is,

270
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,490
then it must be a pitfall

271
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,720
Whatever you say

272
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,490
Fine, Mr. Yan

273
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,440
It's time to go

274
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,670
Let's set off

275
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,520
Okay

276
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,640
Five, four, three, two, one

277
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,090
Please come in

278
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,140
Secretary Nie

279
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,490
Good morning

280
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,920
Why you?

281
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,370
Miss Xingchen has gone out

282
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,670
Where is she going during work time?

283
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,290
She didn't tell me

284
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,570
Each department has received the notice about the afternoon meeting

285
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,570
I'll do the meeting minutes

286
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,620
Rest assured, Mr. Yan

287
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,540
Miss Xingchen has made everything in place

288
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,570
I will be responsible for those work in the future

289
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,370
Give me a reason

290
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,170
Miss Xingchen said that

291
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,670
there's only ten day left before she leave

292
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,240
We need to adapt in advance

293
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,390
You can go now

294
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,170
Mr. Yan

295
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,340
One more think

296
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,220
The user amount of Quwo live streaming

297
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,590
has reached ten million

298
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,570
So the Publicity Department

299
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,490
wants to carry out a lottery draw on Weibo

300
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,090
Why are you reporting to me such tiny thing?

301
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,040
It's because that the most wanted gift of the fans

302
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,390
is your signed photo

303
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,040
I'm a boss

304
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,820
not a star

305
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,320
I don't need to cater to fans

306
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,520
My duty is to run my business

307
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,120
Who came up with such publicity scheme?

308
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,690
It's

309
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,170
Miss Xingchen

310
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,370
Here it is, Mr. Yan

311
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,940
Miss Xingchen's Weibo account

312
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,540
is often used for lottery draws

313
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,320
It's said that such microblog

314
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,640
has a very good effect

315
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,420
That's how the scheme came

316
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,540
The types of gifts is also from

317
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,690
her investigation in fan's chat groups

318
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,720
I will go to the Publicity Department now

319
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,320
to ask for a new program

320
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,790
That's it

321
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,040
Since you have done the investigation,

322
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,840
print the photo

323
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,890
and bring it to me for a sign

324
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,290
Is there any problems?

325
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,020
No

326
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,240
Then I will go to work now

327
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,970
Miss Nie

328
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,970
I have called the landlord just now

329
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,140
He's okay with everything

330
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,820
Now you need to sign the

331
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,720
house transfer agreement

332
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,820
and give us the front money tomorrow

333
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,620
Then the house is yours

334
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,740
The landlord

335
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,620
is in dire need of money now

336
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,470
So

337
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,170
the house price is much lower than market price

338
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,520
You have seen it yourself

339
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,440
It's well furnitured

340
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,990
You can bag check at any time

341
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,020
To be honest

342
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,120
Such house

343
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,820
is very hard to buy

344
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,070
That's why I'm here to see

345
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,520
during my work time

346
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,620
with the risk of being discovered by my boss

347
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,870
It's good. No problems.

348
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,820
It's all finished

349
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,390
All is done

350
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,640
I'm back

351
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,940
Miss Xingchen

352
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,690
Hi

353
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,090
Is there anything happened this afternoon?

354
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,020
The boss asked about you

355
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,670
That's fine

356
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,890
Does every one have time tonight?

357
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,240
I'll stand treat today for karaoke

358
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,940
Okay

359
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,670
What?

360
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,940
The coupon is about to expire?

361
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,590
No

362
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,090
Then you won the Weibo lottery draw?

363
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:49,970
No, no

364
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,070
Then you have received bonus, right?

365
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,570
No. I'm serious

366
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,790
Then for what?

367
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,920
No reason

368
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,070
I'm happy today

369
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,090
You can sing as long as you like

370
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,420
and order anything you want

371
00:22:59,470 --> 00:22:59,940
It's all on me

372
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,140
Okay

373
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,290
I have to report to my wife

374
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,240
I go to place the order

375
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
It's really a long time since we came out last time

376
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,270
We should have fun this time

377
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:05,890
Which karaoke bar?

378
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,940
Where did you go this afternoon?

379
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,490
Fetch a contract at Heyuan

380
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,490
Why did you do such little thing in person

381
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,290
Secretary Zhang of Heyuan has just married

382
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,720
As the first secretary of Bojue

383
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,570
I sent her a present

384
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,590
She agrees to submit

385
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,820
our proposal to Mr. Sun early

386
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,270
Mr. Yan

387
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,640
Secretary Nie invited us to karaoke bar

388
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,990
Do you want to come together?

389
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,140
Mr. Yan don't like that place

390
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,940
Sure

391
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,920
I have to be present for group activities

392
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,220
Besides, it's your treat

393
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,270
See you tonight

394
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,090
I'm just being kind...

395
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,390
being kind...

396
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,490
He took it seriously

397
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:06,090
With the years gone

398
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,370
I have said that

399
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,240
if I shall leave you one day

400
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,040
-I will not cry -Miss Xingchen

401
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,290
The watermelon is so sweet

402
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,020
Have one

403
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,270
Yes

404
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,140
Secretary Sun

405
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,620
Order four durians, please

406
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,970
Four durians

407
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,420
Let me look at you again

408
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Let me tell you I love you again

409
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,220
Don't leave me with the sight of your back

410
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,120
Don't you have anything to talk to me?

411
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,140
When we part, just say goodbye

412
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,370
-Don's say you won't forget -Mr. Yan

413
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,620
I made a mistake this afternoon

414
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,520
I will report to you first

415
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,090
before I go out afterwards

416
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,070
I'm not talking about this

417
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,470
I mean the house

418
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,920
What?

419
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,640
I'm saying that

420
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,870
why don't you come to ask me

421
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,320
since you want a house

422
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,740
I'm can't hear it clearly, Mr. Yan

423
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,820
I mean, why don't you come to ask me

424
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,020
Mr. Yan

425
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,290
There are no durians

426
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,290
Mr. Yan

427
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,290
If you want me to ask you

428
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,220
before you are willing to sing

429
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,990
I then have to beg you

430
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,440
Mr. Yan

431
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,040
I want to hear it, too

432
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:43,890
Mr. Yan

433
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,990
Which song do you want to sing

434
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,890
I will order for you

435
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:46,720
No

436
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,520
Mr. Yan

437
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,170
Do you want us all to beg you?

438
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,590
Come on, Mr. Yan

439
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,690
Come on, Mr. Yan

440
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,790
Which song? Hurry up

441
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,820
I will order for you

442
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,590
Whatever

443
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,620
Then next song is yours

444
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,290
Durians

445
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,040
Next

446
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,640
I have listened to it when I was young

447
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,640
Director Huang

448
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,320
Let's sing together

449
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,020
I

450
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,190
It's such an honor

451
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,340
Okay! Let's sing!

452
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,220
My pleasure

453
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,220
I often listened to it when I was young

454
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,370
Count on me

455
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,420
One thousand years waiting

456
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,370
waiting for the love ah

457
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,420
One thousand years waiting

458
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,420
waiting for the love ah

459
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:44,990
It's all on the key

460
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,690
Who is saying beside my ear

461
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,390
that he will love me forever

462
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,620
All on the key

463
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,870
Just for the words

464
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,720
Can we stop for a moment?

465
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,470
I will sing with you after I come back

466
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,220
Oh my God

467
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,470
My heart, oh

468
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,120
I'm serious. I was on the brink of heart attack

469
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,690
I won't listen to the boss singing

470
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,270
even if I have to work till the morning

471
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,070
Think about it!

472
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,290
No one is perfect

473
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,390
See Mr. Yan

474
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,670
He's not perfect

475
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,920
Come on

476
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,740
Let's sing, just two of us

477
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,370
We really sing perfectly together

478
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,070
Go on... go on

479
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,070
Hello. Mom

480
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,670
Chenchen

481
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,690
I

482
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,240
Why are you calling Chenchen

483
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,090
Give it to me

484
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,020
Dad, Mom

485
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,170
What are you doing?

486
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,890
Mom, let me tell you

487
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,270
I have a good news today

488
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,070
What's wrong with you, mom?

489
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,440
Your dad might have to go to prison

490
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,690
What?

491
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:28,670
Secretary Nie

492
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,440
I haven't finished

493
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,070
What's wrong with you?

494
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,490
I'm fine

495
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,090
What did you want say just now, Mr. Yan?

496
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,420
You know it

497
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,220
I will never give others a second chance

498
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,940
There's an exception to everything

499
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,820
You want the welfare house, don't you?

500
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,240
You can go to me directly

501
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,320
It seems that you didn't think clearly in the morning

502
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,520
I don't need it anymore

503
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,070
I won't buy the house

504
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,370
I'm busy

505
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,640
I have to leave now

506
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,490
I'll get the check

507
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,590
Mom

508
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,020
I have remit RMB 800,000 Yuan to you

509
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,520
As for the other 200,000,

510
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,770
I will try to borrow from my friends tomorrow

511
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,170
Don't panic now

512
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,570
I can definitely get enough money

513
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,070
Hello, Mr. Sun

514
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,990
I'm Nie Xingchen

515
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,220
I'm really sorry

516
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,190
to bother you so late

517
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,820
I don't want the house

518
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,670
I saw last time

519
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,340
Yes

520
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,420
Secretary Nie

521
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,240
I have goth through the contract with Heyuan

522
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,440
There is a wrong character

523
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:06,940
I'm sorry, Mr. Yan

524
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,790
I'll revise it now

525
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,890
Did anything happen?

526
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,290
I feel that you are not yourself this morning

527
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,570
There are some private issues

528
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,290
I'll adjust right away

529
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,120
What is it?

530
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,020
I want to go to the restroom

531
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,570
I will give the file to you after it's revised

532
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,870
Hello, Mr. Liu

533
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,990
I'm Nie Xingchen

534
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,540
Yes

535
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,170
I want to ask you something

536
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,340
Yes

537
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,490
Now the debtor had run away

538
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,820
My dad has the suretyship of joint and several liabilities

539
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,020
Under such condition,

540
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,990
does the creditor have the right to ask for the money from my dad?

541
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,370
Sorry

542
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,670
I'll check it again later

543
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,190
So if we return the money back

544
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,420
My dad won't be listed on the dishonest list

545
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,620
or go to prison,

546
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,190
right?

547
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,240
Okay

548
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,370
Thank you

549
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,870
I'll treat yo next time

550
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,870
Secretary Nie

551
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,240
Sorry

552
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,990
I heard what you were saying just now

553
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,670
I can help you

554
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,520
On what term?

555
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,870
Two

556
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,070
One

557
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,170
You continue to work in Bojue for the next three years

558
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,320
Then no matter how much you want

559
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,670
I can pay you in advance

560
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,720
What about the second?

561
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,090
Be my girlfriend

562
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,040
As long as we are in a romantic relationship,

563
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,140
I'm reasonable to pay money back for you

564
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,520
Mr. Yan, you are taking advantage of my perilous state

565
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,390
It's all on you

566
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,490
Will you give me the chance?

567
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,540
Thank you for you kindness

568
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,890
But I will deal with

569
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,290
my own business

570
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,690
Secretary Nie

571
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:17,570
Did you see Mr. Yan?

572
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,070
Secretary Nie

573
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:21,820
Mr. Yan

574
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,820
Did you see secretary Nie?

575
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:23,340
No

576
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,070
Mr. Yan

577
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,340
You have to sign for this document. It's in a hurry

578
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,790
Is secretary Nie from Shashi?

579
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,990
Porbably

580
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,570
Contact Shashi Branch, please

581
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,940
I have something to do

582
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,290
Director Huang

583
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,290
We decided to eat in the Japan restaurant next our building

584
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:44,970
Would you go togther?

585
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,690
Sure. Let's go

586
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,570
Miss Xingchen

587
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,540
Go together?

588
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,370
You guys go

589
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,470
I have work to do

590
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,640
It's okay

591
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,970
The discount at noon is a good bargain

592
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,990
Let's go together

593
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:55,740
I'm not hungry now

594
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,470
You guys go

595
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,640
Then we're going?

596
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,640
We're leaving now

597
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,920
Go go go, hurry up!

598
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,440
Go! Go! Go!

599
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,490
Where did you find it?

600
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,420
Send to her Weibo account a message telling that she's won the prize

601
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,390
Forget not to make a slip of the tongue

602
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,720
Her name is Nie Xingchen

603
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,840
Okay

604
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,990
Thank you

605
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,570
Why are you staring blankly?

606
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,090
What are you doing here?

607
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,720
Today

608
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,240
I ran into staff of the PO

609
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,770
They said you were busy at noon

610
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,620
and didn't have lunch

611
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:11,820
And I

612
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,690
bought it for you

613
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,040
Time is pressing

614
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,140
Just make do with it

615
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,340
From today on

616
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,340
just call me if you don't have time to eat

617
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,090
I can your special delivery guy

618
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,340
Congratulations that you have won thirty coupons

619
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,240
that allows you to dine and dash in MiFang Restaurant

620
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,570
With this coupon,

621
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,970
you can enjoy thirty opportunities to eat and run

622
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,390
MiFang?

623
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,770
I haven't reposted any prize draws of MiFang

624
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,170
Forget it

625
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,140
It must be a fraud

626
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,990
Eat

627
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,120
Mr. Zhao

628
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,290
You have to hold the meeting

629
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,240
Okay

630
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,070
Okay. I'm leaving for the meeting

631
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,690
Hello, everyone

632
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,570
I'm Zhen Nian

633
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,240
Tobacco contains hundreds of harmful substances

634
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,620
And there are 69 specific carcinogens

635
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,690
Smoking

636
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,170
will not only hurt yourself,

637
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,870
but also the friends and families around you

638
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,620
Today is World No-Tobacco Day

639
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,890
Let's stay away from tobacco

640
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,520
and create a smoke-free environment

641
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,070
Miss Zhen

642
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,820
is worthy of being a popular choice

643
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,220
for all kinds of image ambassadors

644
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,040
She is so elegant even when

645
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,520
recording an advertising video for quit smoking

646
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,240
Mr. Zhao, do you have something to do here?

647
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,040
It was you that told Mr. Yan

648
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,770
that there was something wrong with the publicity photos of Quwo

649
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:49,720
and it should be further discussed

650
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,240
Mr. Yan have some business to do today suddenly

651
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,370
He sent me here

652
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,220
If you are here

653
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,490
then there is nothing wrong

654
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,920
I guess I have made a trip in vain

655
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,740
A thankless task!

656
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,120
I'll leave first

657
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,620
Hello, Xingchen

658
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,420
Yeah

659
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,370
OKay

660
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,070
The third floor. Thank you

661
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,470
Secretary Nie

662
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,240
Miss Zhen

663
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,090
What's that supposed to mean?

664
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,590
Secretary Nie

665
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,120
I heard your call with Mr. Zhao by accident

666
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,120
Here is RMB 200,000 that you need

667
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,770
This is indeed fuel delivered in the snow

668
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,720
But you must want something back from me

669
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,540
What is it?

670
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,120
It's easy to talk to smart people

671
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,890
I have only one request

672
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,370
From today,

673
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,690
you mustn't appear before Jingzhi

674
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,620
no matter with what reason

675
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,690
What's funny?

676
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,020
Miss Zhen

677
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,640
I haven't seen such a plot to smash on people

678
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,690
with money for almost ten years

679
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,790
I'd say that you should keep pace with the times

680
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,640
when you choose a script for next time

681
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,070
You like Jingzhi, don't you?

682
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,590
Miss Zhen

683
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,420
The reason I reject you

684
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,170
is solely because I want to

685
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,490
It has nothing to do with anyone

686
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Even if I leave the company in the future

687
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,070
It's solely because I want to

688
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,920
It has nothing to do with you

689
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,290
Your relationship with Mr. Yan

690
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,520
is your private affair

691
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,720
Please don't pull me in

692
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,790
By the way

693
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,190
Have I told you?

694
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,690
Your name

695
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,990
is exactly the same with one of my college classmates

696
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,020
Only the appearance

697
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,570
is a little different

698
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,720
Maybe I remember wrongly

699
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,390
You were supposed to be here an hour ago

700
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,870
It's too long

701
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,140
Quickly

702
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,990
Take a drink as a forfeit

703
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,920
You call that taking a drink?

704
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,520
It‘ll never lead to the state of slightly drunk

705
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,990
It's just RMB 200,000 Yuan

706
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,490
No need to be so depresssed

707
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,640
Take it

708
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,240
Come on

709
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,470
Thanks

710
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,020
I'll return the money, for sure

711
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,820
You don't need to

712
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,040
That's your money

713
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,590
Stop that

714
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,690
My asset of far more than that

715
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,490
Here is only

716
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,440
the bonus you refused to take for these years

717
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,470
I saved the money for you

718
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,420
You are the owner of account

719
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,820
The password is your birthday

720
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,540
When did you open the account?

721
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,840
Four years ago. You remember?

722
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,440
We have just graduated

723
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,490
There was not any projects to do in the company

724
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,690
And we couldn't even pay out the wages

725
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,870
Many people quit the job

726
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,090
Even I wanted to give up

727
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,720
It was you

728
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,270
who stood in the rain for whole day

729
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,940
just for a project

730
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,690
It moved our client

731
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,020
And the company gained its second life

732
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,820
But you were sick

733
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,320
and lay on bed for a whole week

734
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,820
because of the high fever caused by pneumonia

735
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,520
Really? I was so great at that time

736
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,490
You were

737
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,940
It was your perseverance that made me plug away

738
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,920
It's fair to say that without you, there is no Yuanda

739
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,140
Ever since then,

740
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,190
I have always taking you

741
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,690
as my comrade-in-arms and families

742
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,520
So just take the money

743
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,970
Don't be burdened

744
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,290
You deserve that

745
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,070
But

746
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,490
There is no but

747
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:07,870
If you really want to return it

748
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,090
Marry me

749
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,220
Serve me

750
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,170
I'm okay with that

751
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,490
I won't be moved facing you

752
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,320
But seriously,

753
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,040
what are you going to do in the future?

754
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,090
You have taken all the money you have saved

755
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,170
to pay the debt

756
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,090
And you'll quit soon after

757
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,790
It will be a naked resignation

758
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,820
It's too dangerous

759
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:28,790
I'm fine

760
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,740
It's what we young people normally do

761
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,320
I'm fine

762
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,640
Are you truly fine with it?

763
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,040
Sure. What can be dangerous?

764
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,090
Spend RMB 1,000,000 to buy safety for my families

765
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,620
It's a good deal

766
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,690
Right

767
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,370
Money is just a number if it's saved in the bank

768
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,190
It will be money only when it's spent

769
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,320
Cheers

770
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:55,690
Take it easy

771
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,020
Everything would be fine

772
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,820
Dad, Mom

773
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,890
I have got the money

774
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,020
I'll remit to you now

775
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,820
No. No. No

776
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,170
I just want to tell you

777
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,320
that your dad's thing

778
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,220
has already been solved now

779
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,290
He doesn't have to pay the money back

780
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,270
The guy has come back

781
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,290
What?

782
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,670
You mean uncle Wang who ran away

783
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,820
had returned?

784
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,020
Yes. Yeah

785
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,040
He had paid all the money

786
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,790
Thank god

787
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,690
The matter is finally settled

788
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,490
I have told your father for so many times

789
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,420
Don't be a guarantor for him

790
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,420
He just wouldn't listen

791
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,490
See?

792
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,720
Stop saying those to our child

793
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,270
I have told you so many times

794
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:40,990
Xingxing

795
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,820
I know you want to buy a house

796
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,220
I will transfer the money to you tomorrow

797
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,090
You don't need to worry about me any more

798
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,570
Give it to me. I haven't finished

799
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,490
Xingxing. Give it to me

800
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,020
What's happening?

801
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,690
I'm fine

802
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:57,970
Dad, Mom

803
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:58,990
I haven't been off work

804
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,340
Talk to you after I'm back

805
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,240
Well

806
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,270
Go back home then

807
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,620
Be careful on the way

808
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,140
We miss you so much

809
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:05,740
Bye

810
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,720
I miss you too

811
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,320
A happy ending!

812
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,220
Drink!

813
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:39,690
Mr. Yan

814
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,620
Good morning, Secretary Nie

815
00:43:59,140 --> 00:43:59,690
Mr. Yan

816
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,390
Here are the documents you need to sign this morning

817
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:02,790
Put them there

818
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:03,690
I'll sign them later

819
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,570
Mr. Yan

820
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,720
You are still wearing the clothes yesterday

821
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:24,570
I didn't have time to change it

822
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,640
I had something to do last night

823
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,390
There is a photo on the desk

824
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,340
If I don't get it wrong,

825
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,190
it's the friend of my father

826
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,290
It's you who found the guy

827
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,270
He didn't leave Shashi at all

828
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:49,870
He has been hiding in the card room

829
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:52,120
Did he return the money

830
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,320
by himself?

831
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,720
I don't know anything else.

832
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,390
It's already a great favor to find him

833
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,570
Thank you, Mr. Yan

834
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,640
Now do you think

835
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,270
I am actually a good man?

836
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,270
I always think so

837
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,520
Then why did you reject me?

838
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,570
Mr. Yan

839
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,490
It's in the company

840
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:17,670
I don't feel like talking about private matters

841
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,690
But I will always remember that

842
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,670
you are nice to me

843
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,890
and try to repay you

844
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,490
Mr. Yan

845
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,340
Mr. Yan

846
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:35,290
Get out

847
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,990
Mr. Yan, I've got a document here

848
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,790
-need you to... - Leave it till the afternoon

849
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,120
Nie Xingchen

850
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,620
Nie Xingchen, I want to hear the real reason for refusing me

851
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:52,370
Do you really want to hear it?

852
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,470
Yes

853
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:54,920
I don't want you to use

854
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,690
Zhao Yuanfang as the reason to refuse me

855
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,490
I know it's not him

856
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,890
I'm still in love with my ex

857
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,820
Isn't that enough?

858
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:50,790
Wang Yongchang

859
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:53,270
It's me

860
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:54,470
Who are you?

861
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,770
You owed someone One Million Yuan

862
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,890
but asked your guarantor to pay the debt for you

863
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,240
Is it proper?

864
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,490
Sir

865
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,270
I was truly in short of money

866
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,740
If I had enough money

867
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:06,320
I would not have to run away

868
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,420
Here's One Million Yuan

869
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,790
Take it and pay your creditor

870
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,340
Make sure he stay away from my girlfriend

871
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:20,540
So from now on

872
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,220
I will be your creditor

873
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,770
Don't you ever try to run

874
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,420
I will send someone to watch you

875
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,220
Who's your girlfriend?

876
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,020
Nie Xingchen

877
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,540
Nie Xingchen

878
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,040
It's too hard to be an actor

879
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,720
Oh my god

880
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,390
Back up

881
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,490
Stop looking

882
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:45,440
Just one glance

883
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,690
One glance

884
00:47:59,240 --> 00:47:59,820
Please enjoy it

885
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,920
Wait a second

886
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,790
We need to take photos and

887
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:05,720
share in Wechat moments

888
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,270
Don't you have real matters to handle?

889
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,790
Focus on your meal

890
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,170
Okay, okay, just a second

891
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,920
We are disinfecting the food

892
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:14,470
Okay, sure

893
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,420
Good shot

894
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,270
Send it to me

895
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,190
Let's get started

896
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:17,940
Stay still

897
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,470
What now?

898
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,540
Oh my god

899
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,890
It's all raw

900
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,420
It's especially bad to

901
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,440
your stomach

902
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:26,990
If you want to have seafood

903
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,840
some seafood porridge will do

904
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,640
Bad to stomach? I...

905
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:32,170
Director

906
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,870
You don't have to do this to

907
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,470
'sacrifice yourself'

908
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,370
But Salmon is to eat raw

909
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,240
It tastes good this way with it's

910
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,490
fat, thick and soft touch

911
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,490
I decide to

912
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:46,920
order another one and

913
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,190
take away for my Prince Charming

914
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,340
Are you talking about the brainless one?

915
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,320
No

916
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,520
The one who is a doctor for brainless man

917
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,920
He is not repel me as before now

918
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,040
At least he won't turn around and run away

919
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,040
Please

920
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,020
He is just too tried to run

921
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,620
No one can stand you going to the hospital every day

922
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,620
You are occupying public resources

923
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:05,670
Stay still

924
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:09,720
It's cold

925
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,970
Are you trying to be hospitalized?

926
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,540
You don't want not be able to run, do you?

927
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:14,040
It cannot be good for your health

928
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,690
I will kook into

929
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:17,470
more healthy food

930
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,890
and take him next time

931
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,620
Mr. Yan is calling me

932
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,390
Mr. Yan

933
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,490
Hello, Mr. Yan

934
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,320
Okay

935
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,020
I got it

936
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,540
I will send you right away

937
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:39,420
What?

938
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,620
What is Mr. Yan calling for?

939
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,440
He is asking me to send him Xingchen's

940
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,290
Weibo ID

941
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,320
I guess he is trying to follow up

942
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,070
the retweet lottery on Weibo matter

943
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,940
How painful Xingchen is

944
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,120
No wonder she had no time to have lunch with us

945
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,170
Don't, don't touch it

946
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,590
Do you even have a heart?

947
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:57,820
Secretary Nie is leaving in the coming few days

948
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,140
How could even have the mood to eat still?

949
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:02,790
I'm so impressed

950
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:05,220
The boss is just

951
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,220
squeezing the very last drop of value of secretary Nie

952
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:09,870
That's pathetic

953
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,470
Indeed

954
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,790
Miserable!

955
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:21,420
That's pathetic

956
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,440
I'm greedy to death

957
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:25,670
Hello

958
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:26,840
Here's your sushi

959
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:33,490
I don't like it
