1
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,430
We are having hotpot

2
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,160
Just like our passionate life

3
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,260
Director Huang

4
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,680
You mentioned your wife just now

5
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,380
Why your wife and kid are not here?

6
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,860
They

7
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,660
went to their hometown

8
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,580
They'll be back next month

9
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,280
I want to wait until the decoration is finished

10
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,510
to give them a surprise

11
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,510
Director

12
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,010
Your wife is not home,

13
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,080
so you can finally enjoy

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,980
your free life

15
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,010
What? What free life?

16
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,880
Don't talk nonsense before our boss

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,580
I'm telling you

18
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,730
I'm a serious man

19
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,210
I'm fine

20
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,930
Feel free, everybody

21
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,810
I also want to know what you usually talk about

22
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,160
Usually,

23
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,260
we talk about work

24
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,110
Yes! Yes! Yes!

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,110
But as for free life

26
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,630
after married couple have stayed together for a long time

27
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,360
Sudden separation makes

28
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,830
me miss my wife so much

29
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,660
So young people

30
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,580
you

31
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,810
may not just stay in relationship

32
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,710
go get married

33
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,830
It's good

34
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,710
I think Director Huang's words are right

35
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,110
Secretary Nie

36
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,180
What do you think?

37
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,860
Rest assured, Mr. Yan

38
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,580
I have no thought of getting married

39
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,780
I will not affect work

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,080
I see

41
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,380
But doesn't your boyfriend wanna get married?

42
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,680
Yeah, Sis Xingchen

43
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,010
We are very curious about

44
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,010
your mysterious boyfriend

45
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,630
What does he look like?

46
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,810
Do you have a picture of him?

47
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,660
Yes! Yes! Yes!

48
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,280
I can tell you how the person is from his look

49
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,030
My boyfriend and I don't like taking pictures,

50
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
so I don't have one

51
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,160
But

52
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,510
I'll pass my wisdom as the senior here

53
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,580
and tell you something

54
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,630
Secretary Nie

55
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,180
There are many liar of love out there

56
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,580
who are handsome

57
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,860
and good looking

58
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,910
and lie to young girls

59
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,760
And

60
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,580
all they do it to borrow money from young girls

61
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,710
but never give the money back

62
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,430
Got it?

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
That's right

64
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm telling you

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,960
Especially the ones

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
who are dating you

67
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,980
without telling others

68
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,230
They may date many girls at the same time

69
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,330
Terrible

70
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:52,980
Especially the ones

71
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,510
who tell you he just came back from abroad

72
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,930
and tell you all the lies

73
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,510
of his being somebody to lure you

74
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,280
But what happened?

75
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,160
Maybe he's a married man

76
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,080
You see

77
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,930
It's horrible

78
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,630
Sister Xingchen

79
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,480
You must be careful

80
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,360
Be careful

81
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,960
Have some soup

82
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,220
Thanks

83
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,430
The meat has been cooking for ages

84
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,130
It should be cooked

85
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,040
Yes! Yes! Yes!

86
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,980
Let's eat

87
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,880
A moment please

88
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,580
I need Secretary Nie to take care some work with me

89
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,110
Director Huang

90
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,730
The light is too low

91
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,010
Find someone to make it higher

92
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,310
Go

93
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,510
You guys keep eating

94
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,010
So should we go on?

95
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:40,910
How can we go on?

96
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,080
Stop talking

97
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,510
You talked too much

98
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:44,980
I…

99
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,280
Director

100
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,960
You were the talktive one

101
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,510
How could you let me keep talking?

102
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,580
They are gone

103
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,260
Er...

104
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,450
Let' eat

105
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,060
Let's

106
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,260
eat

107
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,180
Eat

108
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,060
Come on

109
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,930
What are you doing?

110
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,330
Taking pictures

111
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,310
Yan Jingzhi

112
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,060
Are you crazy?

113
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,700
We can use our cell phones

114
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,580
Why are you dragging me here?

115
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,780
Only paper photos have collectible value

116
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,910
When we are old,

117
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,830
we can look at them together

118
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,560
How romantic it will be

119
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,560
I have such a considerate boyfriend

120
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,580
As your girlfriend

121
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,010
I'm a little ashamed of myself

122
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,210
Just be a good girl

123
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:03,710
Let me see

124
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,430
Have a look

125
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,360
This one is not good

126
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,330
It's good. How lovely

127
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:10,960
Come on

128
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,230
Pick one you like

129
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,710
I look good on photos

130
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,180
Everyone is perfect

131
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,510
You arrogant boy

132
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,680
Then I'll take it home and hide it

133
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,730
It's for people to see

134
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,780
I wanna take them home

135
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,180
Mr. Yan and Xingchen

136
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,710
Secretary Nie...

137
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,910
Let's tell them

138
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,560
But we had a deal

139
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,780
But now it is an emergency

140
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,010
No means no

141
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,060
What are you doing here?

142
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,180
We are taking a walk after dinner

143
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,510
We are taking pictures

144
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,950
Why can't you use cell phones?

145
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,730
Why are you here?

146
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,010
Mr. Yan

147
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,030
The paper photos

148
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,310
has collection value

149
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,480
After years,

150
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,180
we can look at the photos together

151
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,480
Yes! Yes! Yes!

152
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,380
Mr. Yan and Secretary Nie,

153
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,960
then you are here...

154
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,810
We are talking about

155
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,210
our project

156
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,480
Like you said

157
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,230
paper photos have collectible value

158
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,910
so I decide to buy the company

159
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,860
and make the machine

160
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,780
all over the street

161
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
We just have an idea

162
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,460
So Mr. Yan took me here to check

163
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,680
But we haven't make the final decision

164
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,510
Right? Mr. Yan

165
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,230
Secretary Nie

166
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,380
Make an acquisition plan

167
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,880
and put it on my desk tomorrow morning

168
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,110
OK, Mr. Yan

169
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,710
It turns out that Mr. Yan went to Director Huang's

170
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,380
for an on-the-spot inspection

171
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,510
It's a huge project

172
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,230
Bravo

173
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,210
It's a great idea

174
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,710
to buy the company

175
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,930
and make the machine

176
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,960
all over the street

177
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,030
You can work efficiently

178
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,510
at any time and place

179
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,280
I've learnt so much from you

180
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,680
You've taught me a lesson today

181
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,980
Now I feel

182
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,510
Xingchen's boyfriend should not be a liar

183
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,310
Why?

184
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,130
Think about it

185
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,610
If you have

186
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,580
a girlfriend who works 24 hours a day

187
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,930
and you still don't wanna break up with her

188
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,030
What does this mean?

189
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,060
It mean LOVE

190
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,560
Yeah

191
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,510
That's not totally true

192
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,180
I agree with her

193
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,110
So

194
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,160
Mr. Yan acted so strangely before

195
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,430
just because work was not going well

196
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,580
Now Secretary Nie is back

197
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,760
Mr. Yan becomes

198
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,710
a working machine

199
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,980
at full speed

200
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:27,980
But

201
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,310
Then Xingchen will be miserable

202
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,510
No

203
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,680
It's not just miserable

204
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,180
It's very very miserable

205
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,460
That's nonsense

206
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,360
Hold on

207
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,830
What are we doing here?

208
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,730
We are here to catch them?

209
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,630
Yes

210
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,510
No, we are not

211
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,630
We are here to take pictures

212
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,180
Hurry up!

213
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,260
I wanna stand in the middle

214
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:47,930
Hurry

215
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,260
Don't push!

216
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,910
I'm in the front

217
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,930
Who stands on me!

218
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,710
I'm the youngest so I call the middle

219
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,310
Is she in a shower?

220
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,310
Is she sleeping now?

221
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,380
If only we could be together every day

222
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,110
Every day

223
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,810
Wake up

224
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,330
Wake up

225
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,780
Wake up

226
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,330
Hello, sir

227
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:31,980
This is your take-out

228
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,660
Thanks

229
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,260
You're welcome

230
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,010
I know

231
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,160
that lots of people like to take everything as it comes

232
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,310
But I think

233
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,880
that the best way is to make things happen

234
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,180
I've been thinking about it for a long time last night

235
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,780
From today on,

236
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,910
I wanna see you every day

237
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,580
and be with you

238
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,330
Mr. Yan

239
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,760
You are my hero,

240
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,910
my idol

241
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,510
You recited such a good poem in the morning

242
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,830
so you must be a poet

243
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,810
I, Huang Tao learnt a lot

244
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,830
What's wrong? Mr. Yan

245
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,380
Did the poetry exhaust you?

246
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,480
You should drink wolfberry tea

247
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,710
How come you're here?

248
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,230
Because Secretary Nie

249
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,980
sent me to bring you breakfast

250
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,110
Otherwise I'll miss

251
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,530
the great poem

252
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,130
Such poem can be heard but in celestial sphere

253
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,510
I can't imagine it hearing any better than that

254
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,010
I heard it

255
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,030
What did you see?

256
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,380
I couldn't see a thing

257
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,780
I'm nearsighted

258
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,780
I can't see

259
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,880
Did I read well?

260
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,610
Great!

261
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,830
Yes

262
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,410
very much

263
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,480
When I was young

264
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,360
Stop

265
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,110
You can have the food

266
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,180
Please go and shut the door

267
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,080
Take everything as it comes...

268
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,910
Nie Xingchen

269
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,560
Mr. Yan

270
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,110
Secretary Nie

271
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,480
This is the purchase report of Guomao Mall

272
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,180
You are late today

273
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,910
It can't be because of this report

274
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,110
Yes

275
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,960
I looked it up last night

276
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,780
The photo room has no great future

277
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,730
but the Guomao Mall does

278
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,960
I've checked

279
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,660
at its periphery,

280
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,680
other than our company's

281
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,130
new buildings,

282
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,780
there are also three high-end residences

283
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,580
and four big companies

284
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,110
Compared to the other regions

285
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,880
it has more favorable policies

286
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,180
and more spending power

287
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,510
What's more important is that

288
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,530
its developer is Shang Yuan

289
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,560
As far as I know

290
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,460
Some time ago,

291
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,710
it has just bought the biggest land of Binhang District

292
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,910
Its current capital chain is broken

293
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,730
Now it's financing

294
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,430
So?

295
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,210
So the Guomao Mall

296
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,010
is worth buying

297
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,930
You stayed up last night

298
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,060
For work

299
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,830
My duty

300
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,910
If you were awake

301
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,730
why didn't you return my message

302
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,110
I didn't receive your message

303
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,530
I need comfort

304
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,310
What's wrong?

305
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
I'm working

306
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,760
Behave yourself

307
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,660
I'm working too

308
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,030
What's the matter?

309
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,310
The moment you left

310
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,360
I already miss you

311
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,830
Sister Xingchen

312
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,880
Sister Xingchen

313
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,530
What's the matter?

314
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,680
You and your boyfriend...

315
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,780
Let's talk over there

316
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,430
Go

317
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,280
Her boyfriend is here

318
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,860
She is strong

319
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,860
I like her

320
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,960
That's what you wanna know

321
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,960
Because, Xingchen

322
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,280
I can see that you and your boyfriend

323
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,430
have a really good relationship

324
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,330
So

325
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,330
I just wanna ask

326
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,280
where you usually go for date

327
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,880
How about you and your doctor?

328
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,580
We have moved a little forward

329
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,160
But

330
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,980
We have dinner every time for date

331
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:39,920
So

332
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,260
So I wanna something different this time

333
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,110
You can go to the river and see fireworks

334
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,380
But it's only for weekend's nights

335
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,580
Weekend?

336
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,180
It won't work

337
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,760
We have a date tonight

338
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,880
In fact,

339
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,580
it's also good to go to the arcade and play games

340
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,760
An exciting atmosphere

341
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,730
can promote relations

342
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,080
But he doesn't seem to be very good at games

343
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,480
If two people are standing silly

344
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,430
wouldn't it be awkward?

345
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,730
Then you can go to the carpenter's shop

346
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,760
You can make something by hands

347
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,710
It's kind of monumental

348
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,380
Oh no

349
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,530
Sister Xingchen

350
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,580
He's a doctor

351
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,310
His hands can't be hurt

352
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,180
But

353
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,610
you and your boyfriend

354
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,630
did all of these?

355
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,180
I guess you did

356
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,510
I know I just heard other's love story

357
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,130
If you wanna play by the rules,

358
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,430
then you should watch movies

359
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,680
Pick a romantic movie

360
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,380
and spend two hours in the dark

361
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,460
You may have different sparks

362
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,380
I didn't mean that

363
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,710
I just think he has lots of pressure of work lately,

364
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,110
so I wanna make him relax

365
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,410
But

366
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,930
Watching a movie is a good idea

367
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,380
Then go to the cinema

368
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,030
You go girl!

369
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,360
The main work of our planning department last month

370
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,830
was to carry out the planning of three in one land development

371
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,660
Now we have discussed with Dongping Design Institute

372
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,710
and made two plans

373
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,480
One of them

374
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,510
is this project

375
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,080
The project is located in the East China Sea

376
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,580
What are you doing with Tong Xin?

377
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,560
It is one of the nine administrative regions of ancient China

378
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,660
Because it is in the east of China

379
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,780
The east belongs to the element wood

380
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
The color of wood is green

381
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
so the name of the place is Qingzhou

382
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,710
The area of Qingzhou is...

383
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,760
She asked me about dates

384
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,480
It belongs to the upper mid-levels topographic structure

385
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,930
The east longitude is...

386
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,510
What is your opinion?

387
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,260
Cinema

388
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,960
Our scenic area

389
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,110
is located at Miaozi Town in the southwest mountainous area of Jinghai

390
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,360
The...

391
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,960
Listen carefully

392
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,590
Keep going

393
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,180
OK

394
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,510
Let's go on with the picture

395
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,130
We haven't been to the cinema yet

396
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,830
Yes, we have

397
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,910
I don't remember

398
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,960
Now take a look at the picture in front of you

399
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,410
Let's go tonight

400
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,250
Work first

401
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,730
The planning area of our project is about five square kilometers

402
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,780
The major functions are

403
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,080
to develop the ancillary industries of the scenic area

404
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,160
and to arrange

405
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,810
the layout and utilization of it reasonably

406
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,710
The biggest feature of our scenic area

407
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,110
is that it is a natural air anion bar

408
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:35,980
with pure air

409
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,660
Thanks to Secretary Nie's revision advice

410
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,730
Secretary Nie

411
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,160
Secretary Nie

412
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,660
OK

413
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,630
Well said, Secretary Nie

414
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,130
Such a good project

415
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,810
Everyone, sit

416
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,230
Director Huang, go on

417
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,260
I…

418
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,660
I mean the other Director Huang

419
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,060
Keep going

420
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,530
OK, Mr. Yan

421
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,930
Th scenic area is located in the mountains

422
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,130
It's 856 meters above sea level

423
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,960
The planning and design of this scenic area

424
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,980
will fully use these 4 areas

425
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,960
to plan the auxiliary facilities of scenic area

426
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,310
and to broaden the area of the scenic area

427
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,380
by secondary scenic area

428
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,530
Xingchen

429
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,960
I think our relationship should move forward

430
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,160
Do you wanna be the mistress of my house？

431
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,510
No way!

432
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,410
It's too formal

433
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,610
and too cliche

434
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,130
It's hard to get to my house every day

435
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,680
Do you want to sleep an extra hour every day?

436
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,530
What extra hour?

437
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:47,880
Aren't we going to cinema?

438
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,380
Go

439
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,110
I mean we need one hour to watch the movie

440
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,130
What movie?

441
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,530
I've picked one

442
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,630
A horror movie

443
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,260
Are you sure?

444
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,410
Don't be afraid

445
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,230
It's all false

446
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,530
I can't. It's so scary. Let's go

447
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,230
Let's go

448
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,680
I am sure

449
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,510
Too scary

450
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,910
The medical records for these two beds

451
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,080
must be detailed

452
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,180
After you get them organized

453
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,260
we can send them to the head nurse

454
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,180
before getting off work

455
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,680
OK

456
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
Check one more time

457
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,530
Dr. Han and Dr. Bai get along so well

458
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,560
Really

459
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:45,810
I've heard that

460
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,980
they were classmates in college

461
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,930
Dr. Han recommended Dr. Bai into the hospital

462
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:49,880
I see

463
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,730
They look like a good match

464
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,110
What a handsome couple they make

465
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:53,980
Yeah!

466
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,430
In my opinion,

467
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,630
the two are right for each other

468
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,530
Here they are

469
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,810
Dr. Han, Dr. Bai

470
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,630
Dr. Han

471
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,330
I'm sorry

472
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,980
I have one more operation arranged temporarily

473
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,730
and forget the date with you

474
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,260
Your thing...

475
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,060
It doesn't show up

476
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,260
You mean the gynephobia

477
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,680
Maybe because I've known Ziyu for too long,

478
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,210
so he doesn't see me as a girl

479
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,660
Hello

480
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,880
I'm Bai Xiaoqiao

481
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,280
She is tall

482
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,730
and good looking

483
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,660
and a classmate

484
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,010
You are Tong Xin?

485
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,630
I heard about you from Ziyu

486
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,210
I'm not feeling well today,

487
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,180
so Ziyu stayed to help

488
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,660
Dr. Bai

489
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,410
You two have the same job,

490
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,810
so the same thing will happen again

491
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,480
But he was tired

492
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,230
and you are not feeling well

493
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,930
If you need his care

494
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,010
he's gonna be busy

495
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,860
What do you mean?

496
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,080
I mean

497
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,180
you are not right for him

498
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,530
Don't talk nonsense

499
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,780
There is no such a thing

500
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,610
Miss Tong waited for you for such a long time

501
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,010
She should be angry

502
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,830
I'm not angry

503
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,030
I mean it

504
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,030
You two are not right for each other

505
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,960
Tong Xin

506
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,730
Stop being so unreasonable

507
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,910
I'm sending Dr. Bai to office

508
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,080
Did I say something crossing the line?

509
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,050
What?

510
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,900
To watch a horror movie

511
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,600
without screaming

512
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,800
is disrespect to the movie

513
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,400
Are you cold?

514
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,550
A little

515
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,000
You terrify me

516
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,430
Hey, Mr. Su

517
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,800
Oh my God

518
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,300
Are horror movies today

519
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,250
all so hilarious?

520
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,300
Not fun

521
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,730
This

522
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,000
OK

523
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,730
Why aren't you watching the movie?

524
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,830
It's not fun

525
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,650
Too naive

526
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,750
Let's play this

527
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,480
Why are you laughing?

528
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,530
Alright, stop

529
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,600
Your reaction of fear is the same every time

530
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,730
Have we ever seen horror movies before?

531
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,200
How to play this?

532
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,830
You put coins in

533
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,650
and it starts to grab the biscuit

534
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,950
I've hidden a surprise in every biscuit

535
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,800
Really?

536
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,150
Go

537
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,130
This one

538
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,330
Wait for me

539
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,050
Hello, Mr. Su

540
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,750
about the project

541
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,450
I'll ask them to make sure again

542
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,500
OK

543
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,550
Miss it?

544
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,580
So close

545
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,500
You see. It's already here

546
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,930
One more time

547
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,780
Come on!

548
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,580
Here

549
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,050
All right?

550
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,680
Yes

551
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,480
Wait for me

552
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,930
I don't believe

553
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,550
I'll tell them to change

554
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,280
Sorry

555
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,330
I’m so sorry

556
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,750
One more time

557
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,280
Come on!

558
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,230
It's ok

559
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,800
You can make it this time

560
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,400
Come on!

561
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,980
Obviously, Mr. Su is more important more me

562
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,730
I got the calls for work

563
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,350
How do you know

564
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,630
he is not flattering you

565
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,100
on the name of work?

566
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,080
Preparation of acquisition of the mall is complex

567
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,650
You tell him that now is your private time

568
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,630
No work for now

569
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,800
Yan Jingzhi,

570
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,000
On call 24 hours a day

571
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,130
is your request of me

572
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:55,930
What's more

573
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,830
Acquisition of the mall is an excuse

574
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,930
because you don't

575
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,300
wanna tell people about us

576
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,780
Zhao Yuanfang's gone

577
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,080
here comes Mr. Su

578
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,130
If we tell people about us

579
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,400
none of them will be my rival

580
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,500
What does that mean?

581
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,230
Since we are talking about old stories

582
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,050
OK

583
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,950
Let's talk about Zhen Nian

584
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,230
No kidding

585
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,550
What do I have with Zhen Nian?

586
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,000
It doesn't matter

587
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,250
No kidding

588
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,730
Everyone knows you are getting married

589
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,830
How can you deny it?

590
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,400
I…

591
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,600
The call is right on time

592
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,580
Hello, Xinxin

593
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,830
Let's drink

594
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,650
Okay, all right

595
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,750
Send the address

596
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,080
You're going to drink now?

597
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,800
That's right

598
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,000
I suggest you drink some too

599
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,900
because drinks can detoxify "jealousy"

600
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,130
OK

601
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:42,680
Next

602
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,100
it'll be my private time

603
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,050
I hope Mr. Yan are not like Mr. Su

604
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,330
calling to bother me

605
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,200
Thank you so much

606
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,300
Bother you

607
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,600
Put on some make ups

608
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,130
Why are you putting on makeups for drinking?

609
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,680
Tong Xin is a dead meat

610
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,180
It's easy

611
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,630
The plan's ruined

612
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,980
So you and doctor

613
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,480
are treating each other like

614
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,350
a fan and her idol?

615
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,800
Is there any problem?

616
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes

617
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,830
Dr. Han stood you up

618
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,980
Are you angry with that?

619
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,030
I…

620
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,930
A bit

621
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,300
Then tell me

622
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,780
If your date was J

623
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,050
will you be angry?

624
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,330
Of course not

625
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,930
I have no right to be angry with him

626
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,680
I should wait for him as long as I could

627
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,300
Then problem solved

628
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,930
Both of them are you idols

629
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,350
why do you treat them differently?

630
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,100
Great

631
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,430
So

632
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,100
What?

633
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,200
That's why you

634
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,630
hate that female doctor

635
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,150
You are not acting like a fan

636
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,400
you are

637
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,580
jealous

638
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,730
Did I do something wrong?

639
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,050
I shouldn't be jealous

640
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,930
Being jealous is a way to show your love

641
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,800
You are jealous because you care about him

642
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,600
If you don't care about him

643
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,780
why should you be jealous?

644
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,000
Even he has all the women around him

645
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,030
it's not your business

646
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,050
Don't you think so?

647
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,200
Come on!

648
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,950
Have some meat

649
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,080
You are thinner

650
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,030
Have more

651
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,330
I'm so mad

652
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,430
What time is it?

653
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,700
You remember to come home, huh?

654
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,800
How much did you drink?

655
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,980
Get the keyboard here and apologize to me on your knees

656
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,050
I'm telling you

657
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,730
I will not forgive you easily

658
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,330
Hey

659
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:00,850
Han Ziyu

660
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,630
I'm off work

661
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,830
If you want counseling

662
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,480
please make an appointment tomorrow

663
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,300
What's the problem with Tong Xin?

664
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
She can't solve by herself?

665
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,650
Why does she need Xingchen so desperately?

666
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,080
What?

667
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,500
I mean Tong Xin

668
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,030
What's wrong with Tong Xin?

669
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,650
She asked Xingchen out for drinking

670
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,130
Both of them put the whole makeups

671
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,800
and drank god knows how much

672
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,080
Look what time it is now

673
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,080
Both of their cannot be reached

674
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,380
Maybe it's not the problem with phones

675
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,450
it's them who didn't wanna answer my calls

676
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,530
You are patient

677
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,580
I'll stop

678
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,300
She's back

679
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,150
She much apologize to me

680
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,450
I…

681
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,580
How much did you drink?

682
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,480
It's so late

683
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,500
What?

684
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,600
Let’s hug

685
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,600
Don't you expect I can forgive you

686
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,480
because you are drunk

687
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm telling you

688
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,880
I don't buy it

689
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,130
What did you say?

690
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,480
Hug?

691
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,600
Let's hug

692
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,800
Jingzhi

693
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,230
I'm sorry

694
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,200
I'll never ruin our date

695
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,000
for work

696
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,550
How about Mr. Su?

697
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,930
Who's it

698
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,230
I don't know him

699
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,130
Do you forgive me?

700
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,500
Half way to go

701
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,400
How about the other half?

702
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,130
Keep working on it

703
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,500
You can dismiss

704
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,750
Where is the smell of drink?

705
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,950
I hate it when you're drunk

706
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,000
Take a shower

707
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,800
I…

708
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,700
After shower

709
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,130
I'll give you a kiss

710
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,800
Let me send you to your room

711
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,450
then I'm gonna take a shower

712
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,050
Shower

713
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,930
Shower

714
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,130
Be careful

715
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
I'm gonna take a shower

716
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,750
Wait here

717
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,350
Why are you getting up so early?

718
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,230
Liar

719
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,850
You've stayed up all night?

720
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,080
Liar

721
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,300
What did I lie to you?

722
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,300
Honey, I'm coming

723
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,200
to bother you

724
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,030
OK

725
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,780
I was drunk last night

726
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,930
Don't be mad

727
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,630
I won't be drunk next time

728
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,530
I blame your bed

729
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,580
It's too comfortable

730
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,330
I’m leaving!

731
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,330
Have breakfast

732
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,530
Withdraw the curtain

733
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,500
Liar

734
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,550
She said

735
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,000
next time

736
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,330
Maybe next time

737
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,150
But she can't drink anymore

738
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:52,530
next time

739
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,230
next time

740
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,750
Stop looking at me like this

741
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,900
Why?

742
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:12,080
You are playing with fire

743
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,300
If you don't stop

744
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,200
I will do some bad things to you

745
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,550
I'd like that very much

746
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,030
Okay! Okay!

747
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,980
It's time to go to work

748
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,900
I can't be late for two days in a row

749
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,630
Can't you go to work with your boss？

750
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,650
No way!

751
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,550
It's called profession

752
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,630
Go

753
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,550
Blow your hair

754
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,930
I’m leaving!

755
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,050
How's the plan of

756
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,450
buying a house?

757
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,950
I've checked some

758
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,780
but none is right

759
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,100
Quality real estate in Jinghai

760
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,900
are not many

761
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,550
If you keep renting house

762
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,980
you will not have the sense of belonging

763
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,880
and it's just pure spending

764
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,050
So you're suggesting me to buy a house asap?

765
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,000
Actually, there is another way which saves money

766
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,080
compared with renting and buying house

767
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,100
So you want to develop welfare housing

768
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,080
to enhance employees' adherence to the enterprise

769
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,130
No!

770
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,580
As for driving to work

771
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,650
two persons are different from just one

772
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,650
I see

773
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,030
You wanna offer a commuter bus service

774
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,630
to the staff of company

775
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,730
to save spending of commuting

776
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,630
But I don't know

777
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,580
the addresses of all the staff

778
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,230
I'll go to the record room to check

779
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,600
and then tell you the feasibility

780
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:00,880
No!

781
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,500
Don't take it seriously

782
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,630
Is the sun too bright?

783
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,300
Let me pull this down for you

784
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,780
No need

785
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,130
Thanks

786
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,750
My lips are also dry

787
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,600
Here you are

788
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,200
Strawberry-flavored

789
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,200
Much better

790
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,530
Your lips

791
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,000
What?

792
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,600
Mr. Yan

793
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,700
I'll go first

794
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,200
Good morning, Secretary Nie

795
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,130
Morning, Director Huang

796
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,530
Let's go

797
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,930
Let's wait for Mr. Yan

798
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,650
Mr. Yan has a call to make

799
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:30,780
Secretary Nie

800
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,800
How come you come here in Mr. Yan's car?

801
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,250
Driver Tang asked today off

802
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,350
You can ask me next time

803
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,200
I can offer you a ride

804
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,600
Where are you going?

805
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,780
You frightened me, Mr. Yan

806
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,100
Twice

807
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,130
Twice

808
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,000
What twice?

809
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,130
What have I done wrong?

810
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,130
As my important staff

811
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,150
I have a mission for you

812
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:18,850
You have to complete

813
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,730
Tong Xin

814
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,300
Come on!

815
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,400
I'll leave for a business trip

816
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,080
If you see Secretary Nie

817
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,300
tell her to give me a call

818
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,080
Director

819
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,450
Where are you going?

820
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,180
The boss asked me

821
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,630
to go to Shanghai and Dongping Design Institute

822
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:41,700
to have a meeting

823
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,850
Dongping Design Institute?

824
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,080
Isn't Planning Department in charge of connecting it?

825
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,730
Yeah!

826
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,250
I think it strange too

827
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,850
But from a different point

828
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,600
it means the boss attaches great importance to me

829
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,230
Right?

830
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,750
Why does he ask you go?

831
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,580
Right?

832
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,130
It means I have some merits

833
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,800
which are shining like gold

834
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,800
I told you to learn

835
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,300
but you don't

836
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,150
You always won't listen to me

837
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,100
Secretary Nie

838
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,000
I'm looking for you

839
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,800
What's up, Director Huang?

840
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,900
Mr. Yan said

841
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,100
that you need to transfer the case

842
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:15,930
of the acquisition of the mall to Zhao

843
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,630
You have other missions

844
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,800
What mission?

845
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,000
So to go shopping with you

846
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,930
is my new mission

847
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,000
It's not that simple

848
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,350
Today I'm gonna cook

849
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,030
and you are invited to be my first customer

850
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,930
Is today some holiday?

851
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,930
Today is the first anniversary of being together for one week

852
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,500
Just 7 days

853
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,330
We don't have to celebrate it

854
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,380
It's called the sense of ceremony

855
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,650
which will make a day in your life

856
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,250
is different from other days

857
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,650
You have to get used to it

858
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,750
In the future

859
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,450
we'll have lots of anniversaries

860
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,730
My dear chef,

861
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,900
what are you going to cook today?

862
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,780
Let's go over there

863
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,250
Wait!

864
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,300
supermarket discount information says

865
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,950
you can buy one of this and get one free

866
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,650
Let's do some math

867
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,580
How many boxes are there in it?

868
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,900
12

869
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:11,250
How much time is left to expire?

870
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,950
10 days

871
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,830
It means that before you finish the first carton

872
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,130
the second one will be expired

873
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,080
The shop takes advantage

874
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,730
of your consumer mentality

875
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,180
to promote its product

876
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,000
If you wanna buy milk

877
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,480
there are 12 boxes in it

878
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,250
2 cartons mean 24 boxes

879
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,400
If we drink them together

880
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,400
we need to drink two more some day

881
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,430
We need a dual

882
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,750
This nitrite exceeds the limit

883
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,200
We need the fresh ones

884
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,780
My dear chef,

885
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,830
So which one should I choose?

886
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,130
If food has been thawed in transit

887
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,530
it will produce a lot of bacteria

888
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:03,600
and ice

889
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,730
According to the principle of the better, the lower,

890
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:08,400
we should choose the one at the bottom

891
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,700
I feel the time I went to supermarket is all waste

892
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,930
after this time with you

893
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,980
I'll never let you shopping alone

894
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,000
Hey

895
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,430
Now it's private time

896
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,680
leave work for tomorrow

897
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:37,400
Let's enjoy our anniversary

898
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:39,480
Tonight,

899
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,400
you are forbidden to pick calls

900
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,380
How about my work?

901
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,130
Let it go to hell

902
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,430
She hang up my call

903
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,480
Zhen

904
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,480
Miss Zhen,

905
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,650
Miss Zhen,

906
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,780
Don't touch me

907
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,700
Zhao Yuanfang,

908
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,380
Miss Zhen,

909
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,900
because you didn't tell your company

910
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,300
that you had broken up with our company,

911
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,630
you have been stuffed in the freezer

912
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,100
So you are here to drink your sadness away?

913
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,730
Mr. Zhao is here to judge me?

914
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,730
Life is all about judging

915
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,000
and being judged

916
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,650
You made fun of me last time, did you?

917
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,800
Mr. Zhao seems a man who's narrow-minded

918
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,630
and vindictive

919
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,550
I'm sorry

920
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,800
I am this type of person too

921
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,630
So we must keep some distance

922
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,980
and be friendly

923
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:59,800
What if I don't agree?

924
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:26,730
Give me my phone

925
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,700
OK

926
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,180
Who it that?

927
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,230
Not important

928
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,530
Don't pick up

929
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,500
Where did you go last night?

930
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,550
Why didn't you pick up my call?

931
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,330
Didn't you know how worried I was?

932
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,630
I did

933
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,130
I was drunk

934
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,530
I won't be drunk next time

935
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:49,550
No next time

936
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,600
You have to share your position with me

937
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,750
You don't have to be so strict

938
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,400
I'm telling you

939
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,730
Because my surname is Yan

940
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,000
so I have to be strict

941
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,730
If you have no signal

942
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,330
or power or excuse

943
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,230
I can find your position

944
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:14,900
From today on,

945
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,000
I'll never lose you again

946
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,800
Call me if the breakfast is done

947
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,380
Be quick to wash

948
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,200
Such a nuisance
