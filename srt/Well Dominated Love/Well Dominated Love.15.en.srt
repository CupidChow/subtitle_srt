1
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,090
Mr. Yan

2
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:40,990
That one over there

3
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,620
is Liao Zhigao, Boss of Hengji Real Estate

4
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,340
Most of them came here

5
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,770
for the piece of land

6
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,890
More information about him?

7
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,920
Information about him is quite limited

8
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,040
But most time it is mentioned that

9
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,120
he met his wife for Tango

10
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,170
But we don't know about the reason

11
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,470
why his wife never appears

12
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,070
Secretary Jin

13
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,470
If my memory is right,

14
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,390
your resume says you're good at Tango

15
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,370
Yes

16
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,390
That's OK

17
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,490
Mr. Yan, excuse me for a second

18
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,920
Though it is spare time

19
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,870
I think I should remind you that

20
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,870
don't even think about playing up to Zhao Yuanfang

21
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,770
for some secret motivations

22
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,170
I don't care what you do in Yuanda

23
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,690
But in my company

24
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,370
I don't allow such things to happen

25
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,920
Mr. Yan

26
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,370
Mr. Zhao and I are not only colleagues but also friends

27
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,770
Please don't gossip on our relationship

28
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,220
Then your goal tonight

29
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,720
is to get close to me?

30
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,290
Yes

31
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,240
I am just too boring

32
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,990
I'm afraid that my former leader cannot make it

33
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,640
You have known that he won't cherish about that,

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,020
but you are just coming to see if you can help

35
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,570
But

36
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,320
Secretary Jin is so good at her work

37
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,020
It seems that it's me who is thinking too much

38
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,670
But I am not quite familiar with Mr. Zhao

39
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,790
Alright. It's ok

40
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,370
You will get closer after meeting him

41
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,140
Mr. Zhou

42
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,520
You are hiding here

43
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,070
Mr. Zhao

44
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,390
I haven't seen you for a long time

45
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,570
Long time no see

46
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,420
Who's she?

47
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,470
Oh

48
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,740
Quite familiar

49
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,790
Let me introduce to you

50
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,470
This lady

51
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,670
is the spokesperson of our Aida Group

52
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,590
Miss Zhen Nian

53
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,970
Zhen Nian

54
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,570
I know you

55
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,590
Superstar

56
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,870
I've heard a lot about you

57
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,020
I am Zhao Yuanfang

58
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,540
Mr. Zhao

59
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,540
It's kind of you

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,090
I am preparing to

61
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,140
introduce Miss Zhen to your father

62
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,240
Didn't he come today?

63
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,490
No

64
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,740
My father

65
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,020
just be lazy,

66
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,390
so he let me here

67
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,470
Mr. Zhao's father

68
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,040
is the leader of our domestic media industry

69
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,850
If you can have the opportunity to meet him, don't miss it

70
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,020
Please don't brag about my father

71
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,240
But

72
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,140
It's my great pleasure to

73
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,370
meet Miss Zhen

74
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,440
Fine

75
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,220
Have a good talk

76
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,190
I have to go there to say hello to others

77
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,490
Thanks

78
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,140
Bye

79
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:20,840
Bye

80
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,770
What's up?

81
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,320
I am just thinking that Miss Zhen's dress is good-looking

82
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,370
Mr. Zhao is also interested in women's wear?

83
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,220
Not really

84
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,990
I just feel I have a good view on people

85
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,290
It fits you well

86
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,490
You sent it?

87
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,140
Of course

88
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,190
You dare to wear it out even without knowing who sent it?

89
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,920
If I know it's from you,

90
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,640
I will definitely not wear it

91
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,770
Don't push me too far, Zhao Yuanfang

92
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,820
Don't you like the dress I sent to you?

93
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,370
So what if I step on it?

94
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,040
This is a public situation

95
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,220
Don't you feel awkward?

96
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,340
No

97
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,040
It's awkward for both of us

98
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,190
I am not an actress

99
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,970
Why should I feel awkward?

100
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,040
Mr. Zhao

101
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,390
In fact, I really

102
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,790
am grateful for you to send me this dress

103
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,820
I'm fine

104
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,640
Indecent assault!

105
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,870
Are you crazy?

106
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,440
Isn't that Zhen Nian?

107
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,480
You just wait and see

108
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,790
Crazy

109
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,440
Xingchen

110
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,990
Can I call you in this way?

111
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,970
Sure

112
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,190
In the past, due to my duty

113
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,670
I had to make you unhappy for several times

114
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,090
I wish you wouldn't mind

115
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,620
Not at all

116
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,070
I have got nothing against you

117
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,290
That's fine

118
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,420
Director Huang often talks about you

119
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,040
I think we are alike

120
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,490
I hope we can be friends

121
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,140
Be careful!

122
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,290
What are you doing?

123
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,040
It's me. I accidentally knocked General Secretary Jin

124
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,990
It's not her problem

125
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,190
It's me. I fell over myself

126
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,490
You don't need to make excuse for her

127
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,640
Is your foot OK?

128
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,740
I twisted it a little bit

129
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,290
I'm sorry. Mr. Yan

130
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,720
I should not make such mistakes under this condition

131
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,970
Have a rest tonight

132
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,020
You go home first

133
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,520
Why are you staring at me like that?

134
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,840
Don't you want to create a chance to get closer to me?

135
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,840
My secretary was hurt

136
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,890
You have to pay me back

137
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,290
Mr. Yan. You think too highly of me

138
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,140
I am not a conspiracy theories person as you think

139
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,690
It was just an accident

140
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,490
Excuse me for not keeping you company

141
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,340
I would suggest you

142
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,420
that you should finish this dance with me

143
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,290
Then what would I profit by that?

144
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,720
You are in no position to bargain with me

145
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,290
So it turns out that you are dancing Tango

146
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,840
to get Liao's attention

147
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,320
Good work!

148
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,040
Good dance for your Tango!

149
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,820
But I am the same with you

150
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,790
I don't like oath with no returns

151
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,690
What condition?

152
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,990
Whatever?

153
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,540
You'd better don't push your luck

154
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,040
I want to go back to PO

155
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,170
Deal

156
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,320
How do you know to hide from me?

157
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,940
If I don't, won't I be waiting for you to step on my feet?

158
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,440
How do you know that I would be wrong?

159
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,440
Because every time you would make mistakes

160
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,840
My boyfriend likes

161
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,740
Rosemary fragrance

162
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,740
Nice dance!

163
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,240
To be honest

164
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,770
I haven't seen

165
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,920
such a nice Tango dance for a long time

166
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,940
Nice to meet you

167
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,970
Nice to meet you

168
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,640
You flatter me, Mr. Liao

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,990
I heard that Mr. Liao is good at Tango dancing

170
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,190
We are just making parody

171
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,690
I cannot do it myself in my age

172
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,690
But just now seeing you dance

173
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,570
makes me remember

174
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,220
the scene where I met my wife

175
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,820
That day

176
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,790
She was in a red dress

177
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,370
just like this lady

178
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,670
The first sight I saw her

179
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,290
I was determined to marry her

180
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,870
I really envy Mrs. Liao!

181
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,190
She can meet such a successful and loyal husband

182
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,990
Don't mention me any more

183
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:41,840
Mr. Yan

184
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,790
Don't you introduce your partner to me?

185
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:45,820
Mr. Liao

186
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,490
I am the secretary of Mr. Yan

187
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,720
I am Nie Xingchen

188
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,270
And also my girlfriend

189
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,840
Well...

190
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,240
I am sure I won't get it wrong

191
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,370
Really?

192
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,170
The feeling when you danced just now

193
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,990
is quite similar with that of my wife and I

194
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,770
I have many things to learn from Mr. Liao

195
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,140
I just want to talk with you today

196
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,320
about the land transfer of Heshan Block

197
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,340
You are also interested in that piece of land?

198
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,040
Actually,

199
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,470
I have the use right

200
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,270
of the lands near Heshan

201
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,640
I want to get that land and develop them together

202
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,470
I think it's not the right time

203
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,020
to talk about this

204
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,240
But I hope to see you

205
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,220
in the bidding the day after tomorrow

206
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,640
Thanks

207
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,570
Mr. Liao is so real-tempered

208
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,420
So you think out the idea of dancing

209
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,070
because of this?

210
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,920
Your mission is over

211
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,190
You can leave now

212
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,770
Mr. Yan

213
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,590
We are on a deal to be your dancing partner

214
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,770
rather than being your girlfriend

215
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,690
So what?

216
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,420
So I want to bargain the chip

217
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,470
I want to be your Chief Secretary anymore

218
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,470
Then keep dreaming yourself

219
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,770
Mr. Yan, why you kicked down the ladder! ?

220
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,840
For people always wanting more, like you

221
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,070
you pushed your luck

222
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,290
You're still here?

223
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,540
It's quite windy outside

224
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,220
Don't make this young lady ill

225
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,020
Mr. Liao

226
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,270
In fact, we ...we...

227
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,090
My girlfriend likes Tango very much

228
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,840
and she desires an opportunity to dance with Mr. Liao

229
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,470
Alright

230
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,390
Let's dance together

231
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Then see you the day after tomorrow

232
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:33,970
See you

233
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,540
Thanks

234
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,320
Please

235
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,070
OK

236
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,320
You have dropped me

237
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,140
I don't have any obligation to act with you

238
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,720
If you want to go back to PO

239
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,090
Just let me send you home

240
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,740
It's too late

241
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,370
Not safe at all

242
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,540
Address

243
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,620
Gosh

244
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,140
I can only say the past address

245
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,240
Zancheng Nanyuan

246
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,040
Thanks for sending me, Mr. Yan

247
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,340
How do you know that I had the habit of dancing?

248
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,870
I want to hear the truth

249
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,220
The truth is

250
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,620
we had always been in love

251
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,020
until the moment you forgot me

252
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,790
Nothing to say to me?

253
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,770
I will investigate your words

254
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,420
Before I find the truth

255
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,140
I hope...

256
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,170
I won't bother Mr. Yan

257
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,720
I won't mix business with pleasure

258
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,090
I am leaving

259
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,270
Wait a minute

260
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,390
You believe me now

261
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,870
Give my clothes back

262
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,890
I can only call a taxi to go back

263
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,820
Why so early today?

264
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,140
Are you waiting for me?

265
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,290
Hey, Secretary Jin

266
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,090
I will go back to the company later today

267
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,690
It seems that I can't escape from it today

268
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,190
Just a minute

269
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,390
Coming soon

270
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,920
Mr. Yan

271
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:02,940
Morning

272
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,190
You always dress like this to the company?

273
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,940
The air outside is too dirty

274
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
I am allergic in my skin

275
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
So I can only do it in this way

276
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,640
Where is your company?

277
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,370
I will send you

278
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:14,990
Don't bother

279
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,870
I can go there by car

280
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,970
Your breakfast

281
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,840
I am leaving first

282
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,070
Close

283
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,570
Your shoes

284
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,070
Such a shame

285
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,290
Luckily

286
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,140
there is another pair prepared in the company

287
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,640
You also like Rosemary fragrance?

288
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,070
Alright

289
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,040
I always use the shampoo with this flavor

290
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,120
Rosemary fragrance

291
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,720
My boyfriend likes it

292
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,820
Bad eyes don't scare you. Great?

293
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,790
Great! Good morning!

294
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,890
What's the flavor?

295
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,720
Are you trying to get rid of the mosquitos?

296
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,590
What do you know about this?

297
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,490
This is the classic type of Chanel

298
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,520
When you have a girlfriend...

299
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,540
Forget it

300
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,320
Mean people like you

301
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,220
won't have a girlfriend

302
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,070
Mr. Yan

303
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,240
What can I do for you?

304
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,490
I want to ask

305
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,420
do girls now all like Rosemary fragrance so much?

306
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,220
Commonly the perfume of big brands

307
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,740
won't launch such niche flavor

308
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,240
Then what about the shampoo?

309
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,620
Is there any shampoo smell like this?

310
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,740
Good morning

311
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,590
Isn't this a welcome ceremony especially for me

312
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,390
knowing that I am coming?

313
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,420
Can't it be Mr. Yan behind you?

314
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,120
Mr. Yan

315
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,770
The first day on your report day, you are twenty minutes late

316
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,170
This is your attitude

317
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,440
to come back to PO with all your efforts?

318
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,870
I'm sorry. Mr. Yan

319
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,790
I won't make such mistake again

320
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,620
I tell you

321
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,090
I can let you back

322
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,770
I can also let you return anytime

323
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,720
Understand

324
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,220
How's the acquisition of Guomao going on?

325
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,490
The acquisition work has all been finished

326
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,840
You can go and check anytime

327
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,420
I have two more hours

328
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,820
Call Mr. Zhao to go with me

329
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,470
Mr. Zhao, he isn't here!

330
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,920
Mr. Yan

331
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,740
I have always been following with this acquisition

332
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,040
Please let me go with you

333
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,140
If you have this time,

334
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,590
why don't you get more familiar to the work rules of PO?

335
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,520
Mind your own business

336
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,050
Miss Xingchen! Miss Xingchen!

337
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,200
Finally, you are back, Xingchen

338
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,500
Miss Xingchen, I...

339
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,230
We all miss you!

340
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,680
Yes, yes, I miss you too

341
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,600
Look, my hairs are nearly turning white

342
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,300
if you don't come back

343
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,480
Don't fool me, you always have white hair

344
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,280
Director

345
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,700
Mr. Zhao

346
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,980
May I ask what are you here for?

347
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,480
For my old father

348
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,450
How's

349
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,430
the shooting?

350
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,180
Quite well

351
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,000
Zhen Nian is a good performer

352
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,530
and she cooperates well

353
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,400
So our group is making great progress

354
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,550
Ok, great!

355
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,900
Thank you! It's OK

356
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,600
Director, I want...

357
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,800
Mr. Zhao

358
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,900
Here we meet again

359
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,800
You know each other?

360
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,000
That's great

361
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,900
I don't need to introduce

362
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,230
Let's see the materials directly

363
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,880
I think these two are very good

364
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,330
I think so

365
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,030
But it can be better

366
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,530
What do you think of it? Miss Zhen?

367
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,650
It's OK

368
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,150
I can try again

369
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,950
Then let's shoot another two pieces

370
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,830
Alright

371
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,600
The market positioning of Guomao

372
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,280
and our shopping center

373
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
share similarities

374
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,930
We don't have to make systematic adjustments

375
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,230
on management and operation

376
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,880
But we have to make our product line more mature

377
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,650
Only in this way can we serve

378
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,230
the targeted family customers

379
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,030
I got it

380
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,850
Mr. Yan

381
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,530
What should we do with the pavilion for taking photos

382
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,950
Do I need to give the adjustment report to you?

383
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,800
I'm sorry. Mr. Yan

384
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,930
But Mr. Zhao specially said that

385
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,800
you asked him to

386
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,350
keep this pavilion.

387
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,900
Did I ask to?

388
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,300
It's said by Mr. Zhao

389
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,780
I seems I have been here

390
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,580
What did you say? Mr. Yan?

391
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,850
Keep it

392
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,500
The logo is covered

393
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,630
Too much teeth are shown

394
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,830
Jump! Jump!

395
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,200
Yes

396
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,400
No! Once more time

397
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,750
Belly button is seen

398
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,200
Jump!

399
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,130
Higher!

400
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,750
Can't you jump?

401
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,680
The fingers are not wide enough apart!

402
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,980
OK

403
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,900
Have a rest, everyone

404
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,950
Ok, great!

405
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,000
Thanks, thanks

406
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,600
Miss, I am here to fix your make-up

407
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,730
Have some water

408
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,650
Ok, your head to this side

409
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,580
Let's go

410
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,650
Go to see it again on the machine

411
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,530
OK! Go!

412
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,630
OK! Great!

413
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,980
Miss Zhen is tired

414
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,080
How can you look at me in that way?

415
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,750
Don't you think I am torturing you?

416
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,300
You are doing this for your personal hate, don't you?

417
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,900
I am doing this for you!

418
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,950
I see you as my friend from the bottom of my heart

419
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,650
Are you sure we are friends

420
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,030
not enemies?

421
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
The relationship between us are not important

422
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,080
After all, it's just a name

423
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:17,980
What's important is that

424
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,580
you are the spokesperson of our company

425
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,800
And you have cooperation with my father's company

426
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,400
If you can't make this well,

427
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,650
people will blame you

428
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,130
that you are not capable and you just pull a few strings

429
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,900
So my strict attitude on you is for your good

430
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,380
Right?

431
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,950
Zhao Yuanfang

432
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:16,750
Miss Zhen

433
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,280
If I say this out, you may not believe it

434
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,800
But I really

435
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,380
don't mean it

436
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,080
Sorry, Mr. Zhao

437
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,500
I mistook you

438
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,300
Sorry

439
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,950
You don't need to be like this

440
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,130
No, it's my fault

441
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,200
If you say so,

442
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:36,950
it's my fault

443
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,700
No, it's my fault, Mr. Zhao

444
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,800
Sorry, sorry

445
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,680
No, you don't

446
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,850
Sorry, Mr. Zhao

447
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,530
Sorry, sorry

448
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,630
No, it's my fault

449
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,000
I am sorry, Mr. Zheng

450
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,230
No, it's my fault

451
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,130
Mr. Zhao

452
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,780
I have already apologized

453
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,680
Sneak attack

454
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,100
Isn't it? Sneak attack

455
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,650
Come out! You!

456
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,800
Take me back

457
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,050
Don't you wait for me at home?

458
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,400
Hello

459
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,980
I live in 5-10B

460
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,000
Send me a newspaper for today

461
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,730
Ok, thanks

462
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,450
Hello, Mr. Yan

463
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,200
Old fox!

464
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,900
It's lucky for me to know it

465
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,080
I have been waiting here but it's not a good way

466
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,030
I have to go home

467
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,200
I haven't had my supper

468
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,630
Hey

469
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,400
Hello, is it Mr. Yan Jingzhi?

470
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,050
Yes, it's me

471
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,530
Your order is here

472
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,050
But the security don't let me in

473
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,980
I didn't order!

474
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,650
It shouldn't be wrong

475
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,150
Are you living in 5-10A?

476
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,830
Wait for a minute then

477
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,300
Mr. Yan, you are back from work

478
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,450
Do you wanna have dinner together?

479
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,030
No thanks, I have had it

480
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,850
Well

481
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,800
Let's talk casually

482
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,000
We should know each other better since we are neighbors

483
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,700
Right?

484
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,100
Go to your side

485
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,180
Thanks

486
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,950
I can wait for you

487
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,750
You are having facial mask when eating?

488
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,400
I have allergic reactions in the face

489
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,350
It contains medicine in it

490
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,480
It will take a few more minutes

491
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,350
By the way, I have had it

492
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,980
I'll start eating then

493
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:01,980
Thanks

494
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,130
I can see you leave early and return late

495
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,800
Do you work far away?

496
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:10,780
Yes

497
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,980
In the New Area

498
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,880
New Area

499
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,480
Most companies there are technology companies

500
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,630
Which company are you in?

501
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,580
Yatai Technology

502
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,630
But too far

503
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,050
I am going to resign

504
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,050
Which apartment are you in?

505
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,550
I can introduce a new company for you

506
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,180
Don't bother

507
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,400
I prefer to make my own arrangements

508
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,030
The food is getting cold. Have it please

509
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,700
Thanks

510
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,080
Though I don't know who ordered them,

511
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,050
it's really delicious

512
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,550
Have a taste!

513
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,380
Then I'll have some with you

514
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,600
How's it?

515
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,730
Delicious

516
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,900
It's you who ordered it?

517
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,530
How can it by me?

518
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,430
Am I such a nice person?

519
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,950
I ordered this to treat you?

520
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,900
Except my secretary,

521
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,480
only you know my habits and likes best

522
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,980
Then maybe it's because we fit each other

523
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,630
These dishes fit me well

524
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,250
I have told you they are from unknown places

525
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,200
Aren't you afraid of?

526
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,880
I trust you

527
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,000
For what?

528
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,850
If you think there is anything wrong,

529
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,380
you would not treat me

530
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,150
Right?

531
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,330
You can trust people so easily?

532
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,900
Do you know Halley's Comet

533
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,650
Long time ago,

534
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,100
at the night before Normans invaded England

535
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,850
there accidentally was the return of Halley's Comet

536
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,050
People at that time

537
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,080
saw the vague star

538
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,400
with a long tail in the night sky

539
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,850
They would believe it

540
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,730
as a warning and sign for war

541
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,030
given by God

542
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,100
In fact, in the history

543
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,050
many people though the appearance of Comet

544
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,500
is related to some disasters

545
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,680
But it is just a misunderstood

546
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,100
small cloudy celestial body

547
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,300
That's right

548
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,150
So I think

549
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,630
this is the same for people

550
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,730
If you don't guess on each other with complicated view

551
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,580
but only focus on the essential of question,

552
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,850
then there won't be so many misunderstandings

553
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,030
and distrust

554
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,890
Am I right?

555
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,080
You like astronomy?

556
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,080
I am interested in it

557
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,650
I read some magazines sometimes

558
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:00,980
What a coincidence

559
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,430
I have just received two magazines

560
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,600
After dinner, we can read it together

561
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,730
Have more

562
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,930
Thank you, Mr. Yan

563
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:28,930
Look at this

564
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,280
Drink slowly while raising your head

565
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,300
Summon your cheek

566
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,530
Duck face

567
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,600
It's being so late

568
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,250
Sorry

569
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,330
In fact, you can push me away

570
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,280
It's getting late

571
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,580
I'll go back then

572
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,650
I will send you

573
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,500
I wanna ask a question

574
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,680
Please

575
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,250
To you,

576
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,730
what do I mean?

577
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,450
Neighbor

578
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,850
Only neighbor?

579
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,200
Someone I knew but

580
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,500
How about you?

581
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,530
The same as you

582
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,950
I have just found it that

583
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,630
I am writing this too ugly

584
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,630
From now on, I will just draw

585
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,230
I won't write anymore

586
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,930
Then good night, Mr. Yan

587
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:54,950
Good night

588
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,280
Get into the car

589
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,050
I will send you

590
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,300
Don't bother

591
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,580
I can take the subway in the front

592
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,000
I'll go to the

593
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,650
New Area too

594
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,050
Let's go

595
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,100
Then I'm in luck

596
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:45,850
It's Ok

597
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,930
I'll get off here

598
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,650
It's still a distance from your company

599
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,330
My colleagues love to gossip

600
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,400
Being seen by them will be easily misunderstood

601
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,280
Thanks

602
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,250
Am I a pig?

603
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,800
I just told him a place so far away

604
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,400
Wasting time and money

605
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,780
Everybody are clear that

606
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,680
Heshan is the 3-in-1 project of this year

607
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,480
The most important

608
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,930
In the afternoon, I will go to Hengji to have the land transfer meeting

609
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,150
All the sections

610
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,230
Any question on your own tasks?

611
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,150
We don't have any question

612
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,300
Neither do we

613
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,980
What about the Engineering Department and Financial Department?

614
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,030
No problem

615
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:37,830
Great

616
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,700
Director Huang

617
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,480
Collect the final drafts of all departments

618
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,080
and then handle it to me

619
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,780
Mr. Yan

620
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,050
Firstly

621
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,000
I am grateful that you can handle

622
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,030
such an important mission to me

623
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,430
But

624
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,530
I have a little suggestion

625
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,480
Go ahead please

626
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,580
In our PO

627
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,750
Mr. Yan and Secretary Nie know

628
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,530
best about 3-in-1 land development policy

629
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,750
I think such an important work should

630
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,200
be given to the most suitable person

631
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,050
So

632
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,500
I would recommend Secretary Nie

633
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,350
Others' opinion?

634
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,630
The work in the past

635
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,800
is indeed handled by Secretary Nie

636
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,500
Secretary Nie also helped a lot

637
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,630
for modifying the scheme

638
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,880
Yes

639
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,330
Secretary Nie is indeed the best choice

640
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,080
Secretary Nie

641
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,250
Can I trust you?

642
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,730
Sure

643
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,480
OK

644
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,400
I want the complete development scheme

645
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,130
before noon

646
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,480
No problem, Mr. Yan

647
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,780
The meeting is over

648
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,800
You go girl!

649
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,380
You go girl!

650
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,450
Please come in

651
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,500
Mr. Yan

652
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,700
I have read the electronic version of the scheme

653
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,700
Good job

654
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,280
Just print and bookbind according to this version

655
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,880
That's OK

656
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:14,680
OK!

657
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:15,730
Secretary Nie

658
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,250
The importance of the land in Heshan

659
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,950
I don't need to emphasize it to you, do I?

660
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,700
Yes, I understand it

661
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,750
All the liquidity funds of our company

662
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,350
have been put into the 3-in-1 project

663
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,180
If we cannot get that,

664
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,800
the project has to be stopped

665
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,580
and our company would face the short of funds

666
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,600
And it will be difficult to turnover

667
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,380
I give this great task to you

668
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,180
because I trust everybody

669
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,630
If anything goes wrong...

670
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,830
I will take the responsibility for my mistakes

671
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,030
Great

672
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,550
Mr. Yan

673
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,180
Lunch is ready

674
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,400
No, thanks

675
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,600
I still have something

676
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,330
Yes, Mr. Yan

677
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,650
He still has something important to do in the afternoon

678
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,680
Why he go out at this time?

679
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,580
Hello! What can I help you?

680
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,930
Hello, I want to find somebody

681
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,500
Mr. Yan?

682
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,230
Why didn't you call me before you come?

683
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,330
I am here for privacy

684
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,500
What can I help you?

685
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,450
I want to find a staff member, Coco

686
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,430
OK

687
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,400
What department?

688
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,830
I don't know

689
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,030
Then her full name?

690
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,450
I don't know either

691
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,830
Mr. Yan

692
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,280
There are more than hundreds of people in our company

693
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,650
If you don't provide more detail information

694
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,850
How can I find her?!

695
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,030
Her face often gets allergic

696
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,930
Allergic? And she has a birthmark on her face

697
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,780
Is there such a person in our company?

698
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,900
No

699
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,580
She wears face mask at work

700
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,230
That's impossible

701
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,430
They are not allowed to

702
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,230
wear facial mask at work

703
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,300
Mr. Yan

704
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,650
Anyone fooled you?

705
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,330
Thanks, Mr. Gu

706
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,780
Mr. Yan

707
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,580
Please wait for me in the lounge

708
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,580
Mr. Yan

709
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,850
I am thinking about inviting you

710
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,500
I didn't expect to meet you here

711
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:26,880
Long time no see

712
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:27,930
Long time no see

713
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,500
Ok! That's it

714
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,230
Alright

715
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,530
Ok, Ok

716
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,280
Isn't that Secretary Nie?

717
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,080
Wait for me over there

718
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:38,930
Secretary Nie

719
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,650
A short time before, I see the person besides Mr. Yan was changed

720
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,450
I thought I couldn't see you any more

721
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,430
Thanks for remembering me, Mr. Liu

722
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,430
Then I won't bother you any longer

723
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,200
Please don't...

724
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,000
I don't mean this

725
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,900
I just want to have a few more words with you

726
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,830
What do you want to talk with me?

727
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,400
You also know it

728
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,350
I have always been

729
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,780
admiring you

730
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,750
If you don't work happily

731
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,730
in Yan Jingzhi's company,

732
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,950
you are welcomed to come to Xuhui anytime

733
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,230
Thanks for looking high upon me

734
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,230
I don't have the scheme to resign

735
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,650
Secretary Nie

736
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,600
I suggest you that

737
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,550
you should look further

738
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,250
Don't be blinded by the name

739
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,100
of overseas group

740
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,880
The ones who can really work well in Jinghai

741
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,830
must be us,

742
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,550
the well-established domestic companies

743
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,450
What do you mean, Mr. Liu?

744
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,850
Soon you will know it

745
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,330
Mr. Yan

746
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,330
Hello

747
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,680
See you

748
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,530
Are you quite familiar with him?

749
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,680
I just met him several times

750
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,700
when I attended the events with you

751
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,230
Let's go

752
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,080
Now please welcome the representative of Xuhui

753
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,830
to give the presentation

754
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,330
Hello, Mr. Liao

755
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,030
Heshan has natural ecological environment

756
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,180
But it is lack of management for a long time

757
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,230
So this time,

758
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,280
our core of development is

759
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,280
Nothing is more natural than the original

760
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,180
We're going to

761
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,150
build a natural holiday village

762
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:35,350
with modern civilization

763
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,030
How come? The same with our slogan?

764
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,500
Come on

765
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,080
Let's have a look at this

766
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:02,950
Thank you very much

767
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:03,880
OK!

768
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,250
Thanks for the speech of Mr. Liu

769
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,050
And the next

770
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,800
let's welcome the Mr. Yan, the representative of Bojue Group

771
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,350
Our scheme may be revealed

772
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,730
Your presentation...

773
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,300
Mr. Yan

774
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,330
I really expects your scheme

775
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,330
I'm sorry, Mr. Liao

776
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,430
We will give up our presentation

777
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,600
You mean

778
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,630
you want to quit from the bidding for Mountain He?

779
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,180
Our sincerity to cooperate with Mr. Liao will never change

780
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,350
and we also hope that Mr. Liao will not make easy conclusions

781
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,350
Selecting cooperation partners

782
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
not only based on the qualifications of the companies

783
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,950
but also based on a clear understanding of the other's quality

784
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:48,830
Mr. Yan

785
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,080
It seems you just not prepare well

786
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,080
You just want us

787
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,430
to pay the price with you

788
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,150
Mr. Yan

789
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,630
Thanks for your advice

790
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,350
But today since it's me who organized

791
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,500
this meeting

792
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,580
I must give you a result for everybody

793
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:16,530
And today

794
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,430
the most impressive thing

795
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,100
must be the words of Mr. Liu just now

796
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,880
Nothing is more natural than the original

797
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,400
It is also my expectation for Heshan

798
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,000
Mr. Yan

799
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,330
I'm sorry

800
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,350
I'm sorry, Mr. Liao

801
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,750
It's our problem

802
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,300
I hope another opportunity to cooperate again

803
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:40,680
I will

804
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,030
Mr. Liao

805
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,750
It's my honor to hold the same ideas as yours

806
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,630
Five days later

807
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,450
Welcome to sign your contract in Hengji

808
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,230
I will

809
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,600
Mr. Yan

810
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,950
It's my carelessness to cause the reveal of the scheme

811
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,030
I would accept punishments

812
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,380
I am too busy to consider about your responsibilities

813
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,880
Inform the relevant department heads

814
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:02,980
We will have a meeting ten minutes later

815
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,850
Yes, Mr. Yan

816
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,030
The assessment report of loss by the Financial Department

817
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:06,630
has come out

818
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,030
Now except the project funds to pay the contractors

819
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,530
that we should pay,

820
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,980
we also have to pay for the liquidated damage additionally

821
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,450
The public also attaches great importance to

822
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,430
our 3-in-1 project

823
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,430
If the project stops at this time,

824
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:16,430
there will be a greatly negative effect

825
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,930
on the company's reputation

826
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,400
And the shareholders are waiting for your reply there

827
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,180
Inform the contractors to

828
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,600
suspend work for five days

829
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,050
Don't tell them the specific reasons

830
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,800
I will go to have a meeting with the leaders of all departments

831
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,630
In additional, inform the supervisory department to

832
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,400
investigate on the persons responsible for the scheme

833
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,480
I need to know

834
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,250
who on earth reveals our secret

835
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:47,850
Understand

836
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,280
Since the boss took over this company,

837
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,030
he has always been unstoppable on everything

838
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,280
and he has never had such a big failure like this

839
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,730
I think

840
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,150
there is a smell of death

841
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,200
approaching us

842
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,650
Sister Xingchen

843
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,680
Sister Xingchen

844
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,100
Secretary Nie

845
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,030
What's on earth is the scheme?

846
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,800
Is the boss going mad?

847
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,430
I can't tell the exact thing

848
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,530
But the boss is getting all apartments to have a meeting

849
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,480
to discuss a solution

850
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,030
Then why are you back?

851
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,130
Mr. Yan

852
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,130
The heads of all departments are already here

853
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,180
We can go inside

854
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,500
You are not wanted here for the time being

855
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,830
You can leave here

856
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:04,500
Secretary Nie

857
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:08,630
Mr. Yan asks me to investigate

858
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,150
the business spy inside our company

859
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,130
Please cope with us

Mr. Yan

861
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,850
How do you know I like the dessert of this store?

862
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,400
I didn't buy it for you

863
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,780
On one hand, you refuse me

864
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:33,950
On the other hand, you come to me

865
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,000
Oh my god

866
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,280
You will make me crazy
