1
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,000
Thanks for what you did today!

2
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,020
The security was so careless this time

3
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,350
that the outsiders sneaked into here

4
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,670
and installed a wireless micro camera

5
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,170
But this is what the investors should do

6
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,170
You're welcome

7
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,670
That's okay!

8
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,720
Bye

9
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,220
You, you'll leave?

10
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,420
Of course

11
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,650
As the investor, it's needless to say thanks

12
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,970
But as friends,

13
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,850
don't you need to express my thanks?

14
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,800
How?

15
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,220
Nothing else

16
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,800
but a treat OK?

17
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,220
Mr. Zhao

18
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,500
Has anybody told you

19
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,550
this old-fashioned way of treat?

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,150
A beautiful lady just told me that

21
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,120
So

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,420
Does it work, beauty?

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,720
If you want to have a dinner with me, you should make an appointment in advance

24
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm making the appointment right now!

25
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,370
Then you can just wait!

26
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,670
Call me

27
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,050
Call me!

28
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,820
I'm full of energy today!

29
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,150
Morning! Morning!

30
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,770
What's wrong? Director Huang

31
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,700
Okay, I see

32
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,070
The construction site of the tourist resort caught fire!

33
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,000
Mr. Yan

34
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,850
Mr. Yan

35
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,220
Look out!

36
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,320
Xingchen

37
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,320
Xingchen? Xingchen?

38
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,970
Secretary Nie! Secretary Nie!

39
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,600
Help!

40
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,870
Help! Help!

41
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,720
Help!

42
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,400
Stretch! Come on!

43
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,600
Secretary Nie

44
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,020
Come on! Quickly!

45
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,220
Be careful! Slow down!

46
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,720
Xingchen

47
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,550
Excuse me! Excuse me!

48
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,700
Xingchen! Jingzhi

49
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,200
Calm down!

50
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,100
I'm here

51
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,020
Are you okay?

52
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,770
I'm fine

53
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,070
Don't let anything happen to him

54
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,770
Don't worry

55
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,770
Mr. Yan

56
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,220
I'm the secretary of Mr. Zhao of Yuanda

57
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,970
My last name is Nie

58
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,400
Welcome to Jinghai

59
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,900
Since we met for the first time

60
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,400
you've been asking such question

61
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,200
What on earth answer do you want?

62
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,120
I just want to know

63
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,050
are you in the memory I lost?

64
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,720
You aren't

65
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,150
in my memory

66
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,370
I never believed in fate before

67
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,570
but until fate made us meet again

68
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,920
Then I thought

69
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,420
many things in life

70
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,220
are already doomed

71
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,000
We have missed each other for five years

72
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,620
I don't want to wait any longer

73
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,720
Xingchen

74
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,270
Can you hear me?

75
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,020
You're awake!

76
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,100
Wait, I'll call the doctor

77
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,470
Xingchen, are you okay?

78
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,620
Who are you?

79
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:54,750
I...

80
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,420
Don't you remember me?

81
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,500
Ziyu

82
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,570
Go and check how's she going

83
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,520
She just woke up

84
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,800
It's okay

85
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,520
Did she say anything?

86
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,570
She...

87
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,170
She just

88
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,620
forgot me!

89
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,770
Don't worry

90
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,920
It's just temporary memory impairment caused by

91
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,520
a slight concussion

92
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,250
She'll be alright when she wakes up!

93
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,400
So

94
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,650
this is the feeling that

95
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,400
be forgotten by someone

96
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,200
Jingzhi

97
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,720
I've found the reason why you lost memory

98
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,170
I discussed your problems

99
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,820
with many doctors both at home and abroad

100
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,500
Dr. William raised a possibility

101
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,900
Your amnesia

102
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,370
was possibly caused by

103
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,900
emotional damage

104
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,700
Everybody has seven emotions

105
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,150
And abnormal emotions

106
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,120
will bring disorder to your nerves

107
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,920
For you, love

108
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,300
is just a mental stimulation

109
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,420
So

110
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,170
As you're indulged in a love,

111
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,700
you'll lose memory

112
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,150
and forget this memory

113
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,400
So

114
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,620
You mean

115
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,670
I'll lose memory again and again

116
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,070
and forget my lover?

117
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,870
It sounds unbelievable,

118
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,570
but it's just like an overload computer,

119
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,070
it will shut down or restart

120
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,650
because of overheat

121
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,570
And the files that you opened

122
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,650
will be damaged or lost

123
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,700
Then is there any similar case？

124
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,570
There was a news that

125
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,900
a girl

126
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,000
would reset her memory every two hours

127
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,220
because of her brain was damaged

128
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,870
The human brain is so complicated

129
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,570
that why you're stimulated by love

130
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,350
We still need to verify this

131
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,250
Let me know if there's any progress

132
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,120
Lady,

133
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,900
please behave yourself!

134
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,800
You'll regret it

135
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,950
if you remember all

136
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,750
Look out!

137
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,420
Xingchen

138
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,050
Xingchen

139
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,550
Yan Jingzhi

140
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,150
Thanks for not giving up on me for five years!

141
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,550
So this time,

142
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,220
whatever will happen,

143
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,870
let me protect you

144
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,400
You're awake

145
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,670
Dr. Han

146
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,950
How do you feel?

147
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,600
Where is Yan Jingzhi?

148
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,170
It seems that you don't have any sequela of consciousness disorder

149
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,750
And what's wrong with it?

150
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,920
When did he leave?

151
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,820
Did he say anything?

152
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm here to help you with your illness

153
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,820
And I'm responsible for answering your questions

154
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,370
Vertigo,

155
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,100
nausea

156
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,020
and lethargy,

157
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,650
do you have any of these symptoms?

158
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,070
I fell a little sleepy

159
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,820
Don't worry

160
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,650
It's normal situation after the concussion

161
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,150
If nothing abnormal happens in a couple of days,

162
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,200
you can just be discharged from the hospital

163
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,400
And then there'll be a doctor to help you to change dressings

164
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,420
Okay!

165
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,570
Can you answer my question now?

166
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,500
Jingzhi left after

167
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,070
he sent you to the hospital

168
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,370
Left?

169
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,500
Did he say anything to me?

170
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,170
No

171
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,020
That's impossible!

172
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,820
I clearly felt that he was worried about me

173
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,800
before I fainted yesterday

174
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,600
He held me all the time

175
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,620
Vertigo and hallucination

176
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,700
are normal situation

177
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,200
caused by craniocerebral trauma

178
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,720
You don't have to overthink

179
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,820
You need rest now

180
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,820
Sister Xingchen

181
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,620
Xinxin

182
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,700
May I come in?

183
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,070
Sure

184
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,400
Director Huang,

185
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,820
how come you're here?

186
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,200
My little princess!

187
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,850
Sister Xingchen

188
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,500
We come to see you

189
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,300
I heard from the boss you were injured this morning

190
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,150
We're, on behalf of PO,

191
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,070
to console you!

192
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,920
How about your injury?

193
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,120
Is it serious?

194
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,320
It's okay

195
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,770
It's just a little skin injury

196
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,200
It's fortunate that you didn't hurt your face

197
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,800
Otherwise, no matter how much our boss pay,

198
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,820
it cannot afford the beauty of sister Xingchen

199
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,270
How did Mr. Yan tell you about it?

200
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,500
He said

201
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,820
it's a work-related injury

202
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,520
You can rest for a while

203
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,970
and it's a paid vacation

204
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,100
Think about it!

205
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,600
At the crucial moment,

206
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,550
you can know how much the boss values you

207
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,750
Sister Xingchen,

208
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,900
you just have a rest!

209
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,300
One friend of mine works here, too

210
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,550
I'll pay a visit

211
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,700
You baby bear!

212
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,670
Look, look who's here

213
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,020
Sister Xingchen needs a rest

214
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, yes, yes!

215
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,300
Then, then I also leave you alone to rest

216
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,320
I need to go back to the company, too

217
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,550
There's a lot of things to do in the company

218
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,770
Alright!

219
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,750
Thanks for coming over, guys.

220
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,070
I'll go back to work in a few days

221
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,020
Okay! Okay! Okay!

222
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,070
What's okay?

223
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,070
No need to hurry

224
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,670
You just take more time to rest

225
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,250
The paid vacation

226
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,120
cannot be enjoyed by everyone

227
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,920
Oh, yes, yes!

228
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,250
No need to hurry! No need to hurry!

229
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,400
Then, then we're leaving

230
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,650
Okay!

231
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,970
Thank you!

232
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,450
Okay!

233
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,150
Sister Xingchen

234
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,800
Well, you take a good rest! Take a good rest!

235
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,150
OK! We're leaving!

236
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,200
Take a good rest! Bye!

237
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,470
Take a good rest!

238
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,150
Okay!

239
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,820
Is it really my hallucination?

240
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,570
Are you hiding from me?

241
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,800
Specifically...

242
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,300
There's still a problem here

243
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,270
Let's discuss after the test report comes out

244
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,500
Why are you here now?

245
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,150
I came to visit my colleague

246
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,420
And I brought you and your dad sushi

247
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,950
Have you seen President Han?

248
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,600
We've had an informal meal together

249
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,450
Ziyu

250
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,400
You're off duty this afternoon, right?

251
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,520
Yes

252
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,470
But I have an appointment with Xiaoqiao to go to the exhibition in the afternoon

253
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,090
Luckily, I came in time

254
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,570
I almost put Dr. Han in the woods

255
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,400
In fact, the point not on watching the exhibition

256
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,870
but on paying a visit to our senior sister

257
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,020
She just returned from the U.S.

258
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,100
Oh, senior sister!

259
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,420
But,

260
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,120
aunt Han asked me out for dinner

261
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,550
Don't you go with me?

262
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,270
My mom?

263
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,650
You find a reason to refuse her

264
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:54,950
But

265
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,650
I've promised her already

266
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,250
And

267
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,800
if you don't help me,

268
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,000
there will be more trouble for you if we spill the beans

269
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,970
Xiaoqiao,

270
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,070
maybe I cannot go to

271
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,950
the exhibition this afternoon

272
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,320
It's okay

273
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,470
It's hard for you to have spare time with aunt

274
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
Then I'll go on with work

275
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,870
Sorry!

276
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,200
You're totally different today!

277
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,150
Absolutely!

278
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,120
At least I met with your parents

279
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,020
and your justifiable girlfriend

280
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,020
My mother was just too excited

281
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,400
You don't have to take it to heart

282
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,570
That's not okay!

283
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,550
Aunt Han likes me so much

284
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,470
I need to live up to her expectations

285
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,170
I mean...

286
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,270
I told aunt Han

287
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,870
I'm the number one fan of you

288
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,370
Come over here!

289
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,520
You have washed your hands, haven't you?

290
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,770
Come on. Sit down, sit down!

291
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,620
Taste some sushi I brought for you

292
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,450
Here you are

293
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,070
Mr. Yan

294
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,200
In the accident,

295
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,420
if Secretary Nie is included,

296
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,770
there was 13 people in total were injured

297
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,750
At present,

298
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,820
they're treated in Jinghai Hospital

299
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,370
The HR has sent representative to pay a visit

300
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,800
And the compensation and subsidies have been in place

301
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,570
The PR Department has set up

302
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,300
network emergency response system,

303
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,350
mainly focusing on the latest news

304
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,450
of all major websites

305
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,800
For the online complaints,

306
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,400
we'll make explanation and reply

307
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,200
after unifying the words

308
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,300
The investigation result of the accident has come out

309
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,570
Here you are

310
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,800
Have a look please

311
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,950
Mr. Yan

312
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,920
Have a look please

313
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,270
I heard that the company has arranged the visits to all the injured people

314
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,050
How about the others?

315
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,350
The HR paid visits

316
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,050
to Secretary Nie

317
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,520
Tong Xin and I took the visit

318
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,940
How is Secretary Nie?

319
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,900
The doctor said it was a slight concussion

320
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,000
and skin trauma

321
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,900
I

322
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,170
am worried about that girls cherish a beautiful face

323
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,600
and hoped she couldn't be disfigured

324
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,870
But I was relieved when

325
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,850
I saw Secretary Nie

326
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,370
The accident report is well written

327
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,250
What's the matter?

328
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,900
Nie Xingchen is missing

329
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,500
What's the big deal?

330
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,820
Mr. Yan leaves without telling what should we do!

331
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,150
He cares about me indeed

332
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,870
He pretended not

333
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,320
Please help me check

334
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,050
all the monitoring rooms near Jinghai Hospital

335
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,020
Help me find someone

336
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,920
Don't ask so many questions!

337
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,820
You just contact them how to check firstly

338
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,600
OK?

339
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,420
Yan Jingzhi

340
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,320
Don't bother

341
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,270
I find her!

342
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,420
Why is Mr. Yan here?

343
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,070
How about we have afternoon tea and watch a movie together?

344
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,020
When did Secretary Nie learn

345
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,320
the trick of cheating?

346
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,000
I learned it from you!

347
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,370
How do you know the trick of cheating?

348
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,050
You finally remember it?

349
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,470
It's just a story in primary school textbooks

350
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,450
There has something to do in the company

351
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,070
I'll go first

352
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,120
You still don't tell the reason why you are here!

353
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,920
You were injured because of me

354
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,200
I should be responsible for you

355
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,320
Okay!

356
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,370
What are you gonna do?

357
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,750
I find someone to send a check to you

358
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,120
You can fill in the price at will

359
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,270
Then if I fill in a

360
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,870
whopping price you cannot afford?

361
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,350
You'd better think it over before you tell me

362
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,200
Okay!

363
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,500
Then I'll go to the roof to think it over

364
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,470
My God!

365
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,570
Nie Xingchen

366
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,050
Don't run around!

367
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,320
Nie Xingchen

368
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,400
Mr. Yan, is there anything else?

369
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,450
Come back to your ward with me

370
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,220
It's not the company here

371
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,460
It's unnecessary for I to obey what you said, is it?

372
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,650
The patients need to go back to the ward!

373
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,120
Get your hands off me!

374
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,400
You listen to me. On what grounds you care about me?

375
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,660
Get your hands off me! I'll definitely do that today!

376
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,200
Let's go!

377
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,270
What's the matter?

378
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,020
My feet!

379
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,200
My head!

380
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,300
How's that?

381
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,650
She just hit her head

382
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,600
Does she need to be X-rayed?

383
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,450
You think human head is glass

384
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,820
and it'll break with a slight touch?

385
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,100
It's okay!

386
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,700
It will be fine after she's awake

387
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,350
A moment please!

388
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,820
It seemed she just twisted her foot

389
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,450
Hey, friend!

390
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,820
I'm a brain doctor

391
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,100
but an orthopedic doctor

392
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,320
Then you just find an orthopedic doctor here

393
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,450
Do you think it's your company here

394
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,620
and everybody else

395
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,870
is on-call like me?

396
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,350
Does she has a history of sprains

397
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,420
or a habitual a sprained ankle?

398
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,420
No

399
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,170
It should be the third time if we count this time

400
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,050
I'm going to prescribe medicine first

401
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,170
You recover your memory?

402
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,720
No

403
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,250
No? How do you know I've sprained my ankle for three times?

404
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,720
Yes

405
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,720
How much can you recall?

406
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,000
All the things since I met you

407
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,600
after I returned from abroad

408
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,970
You finally remember me!

409
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,550
Are you so happy?

410
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,470
Of course I do!

411
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,150
Although you don't remember what happened five years ago,

412
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,170
later,

413
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,720
we still have many five-year to make it up

414
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,650
That's enough!

415
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,000
Then if

416
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,350
I forget you again and again?

417
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,870
Love amnesia!

418
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,320
An amnesia caused by emotional damage

419
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

420
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,570
Maybe I'll forget all the things related to you

421
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,220
again and again

422
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,370
It doesn't matter

423
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,250
It's medically advanced now

424
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,900
We can visit hospitals all over the world

425
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,500
There will definitely be a cure

426
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,100
Ziyu has already learned about it

427
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,450
And there's no similar case

428
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,450
So you've been hiding

429
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,970
about your memory recovery

430
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,450
I don't want to let you down again

431
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,620
Then did you give up on

432
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,020
our relationship unilaterally?

433
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,450
I don't want you to be hurt by me all the time

434
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,250
If it continues,

435
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,350
it's just a waste of our feelings

436
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,050
I'm involved too

437
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,770
And you don't own the right to decide instead of me

438
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,520
I know you cannot accept it at the moment

439
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,770
You'll figure it out

440
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,970
after you calm down

441
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,100
This decision

442
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,300
will be good to both of us

443
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,650
That's good you think as it is

444
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,270
Xingchen

445
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,650
Don't get emotional!

446
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,220
Let's calm down

447
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,250
We'll cover this after we calm down

448
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,970
Nie Xingchen is the kind of woman I'm afraid of most

449
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,100
She's both capable and incapacitated

450
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,850
In my view,

451
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,600
she won't easily let it go

452
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,670
I'd rather let it go

453
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,050
than making her suffer in the future

454
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,400
She still has the chance to gain happiness

455
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,150
She has already knew about your illness

456
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,220
But if she'd like to be with you?

457
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,000
I don't want to consume her life

458
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,320
I hope she can feel it's beautiful

459
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,700
when she recall

460
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,600
Ziyu

461
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,670
I've been looking for you for a while!

462
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,950
This is?

463
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,720
Yan Jingzhi

464
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,770
She's my colleague, Bai Xiaoqiao

465
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,120
It's too indifferent to introduce me as a colleague!

466
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,550
With an additional explanation

467
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,550
She's my college classmate

468
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,450
Your gossip girl?

469
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,450
It's been years ago!

470
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:10,970
I'm screwed

471
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,320
You'll be responsible

472
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,300
if I cannot get married

473
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,670
Dr. Bai

474
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,850
I still have something to talk with Ziyu in private

475
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,550
Then I don't bother you

476
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,600
I'll wait you in the office

477
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,070
Han Ziyu

478
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,020
Don't blame me for not reminding you

479
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,850
You have a girlfriend now

480
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,120
You mean Tong Xin?

481
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,370
I don't want my secretary

482
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,620
to be affected at work because of emotional problems

483
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,570
That' also applicable to you and Secretary Nie

484
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,300
We'll share!

485
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,950
See you!

486
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Maybe I'll forget all the things related to you

487
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,720
again and again

488
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,170
If it continues,

489
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,900
it's just a waste of our feelings

490
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,320
Sister Xingchen

491
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,520
I come to see you again

492
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,600
How are you feeling?

493
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
It's just you alone

494
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,420
Yeah!

495
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,270
Director Huang is too busy

496
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,470
to come out the company

497
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,920
Do you want orange?

498
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,200
Thank you!

499
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,920
By the way, sister Xingchen

500
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,520
The…

501
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,300
When does your attending doctor usually

502
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,600
come to the ward around?

503
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,550
You mean Dr. Han?

504
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,650
He seems to be busy everyday

505
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,650
When can he come around isn't fixed

506
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:10,950
Miss Nie

507
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:12,970
Dr. Han

508
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:13,900
Tong Xin

509
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,970
You're here to see your colleague, right?

510
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:18,800
Yes

511
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,300
I came to see my colleague

512
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,570
Miss Nie

513
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,800
If your feet still hurt,

514
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,200
you can spray this to relieve

515
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,800
Okay!

516
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,950
Thank you, Dr. Han

517
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,200
Then I'll go on with work

518
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,520
He's the doctor you mentioned, right?

519
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,670
Sister Xingchen

520
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,450
Do you think Dr. Han is excellent

521
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,220
and I'm a little overreached?

522
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,250
Everybody is equal in a relationship

523
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,400
I think you cannot always look up him

524
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,570
like a fan

525
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,450
You should take him

526
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,820
as an ordinary man

527
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,870
Thus you have the chance to develop your relationship

528
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,900
I've been a fake girlfriend who met her parents

529
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,420
from a little fan

530
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,550
Sister Xingchen

531
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,050
You mustn't ridicule me

532
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,170
I didn't realize that

533
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,420
I liked him

534
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,800
I just wanted to help him

535
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,070
to solve the problem

536
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,020
But who knows I cannot let it go now!

537
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,020
If I were you, I would confess to him directly

538
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,470
No matter what the result will be,

539
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,770
he'll at least know your attention deep in heart

540
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,670
Confess to him directly?

541
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,770
What if he'll refuse me

542
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,820
and I'll have no chance

543
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,820
to by his side?

544
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,120
If he doesn't have someone he likes by his side,

545
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,170
you should go on persisting

546
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,870
I think persistence is magic

547
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,370
But,

548
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,050
If he does have someone he likes by his side

549
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,450
Then I suggest you stop and

550
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,270
give up on him

551
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,000
And to find the one who loves you

552
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,050
Only paper photos have collectible value

553
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,150
When we are old,

554
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,870
we can look at the photos together

555
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,970
How romantic it will be!

556
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,500
The bear is like Secretary Nie,

557
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,020
challenging my dignity again and again

558
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,220
But I'm the only winner

559
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,920
Are you okay?

560
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,570
I can't sleep anyway

561
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,420
If you want to have someone to chat with you,

562
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,700
I can be your around

563
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,270
Look

564
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,600
This is my boyfriend

565
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,450
You two are a perfect pair

566
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,520
We planned to study for a doctorate in Germany

567
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,300
But unexpectedly,

568
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,800
I had been examined a stomach cancer

569
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,270
I don't know how long it'll take to fight against cancer

570
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,970
Maybe five yeas

571
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,370
Maybe ten years

572
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,970
I don't even know

573
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,850
whether tomorrow or accident will come first

574
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,950
So you want to break up with him?

575
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,750
I don't want to be drag on him

576
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,470
instead of ending this painfully

577
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,770
I, I don't want to get in the way to his future, either

578
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,670
Sister, tell me

579
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,920
I did the right thing on this

580
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,020
Sorry!

581
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,750
I cannot give you an answer

582
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,050
But,

583
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,220
If I were you,

584
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,050
as long as I own hope to live on

585
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,850
and as long as he's willing to face this with me,

586
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,350
I wouldn't easily give up this relationship

587
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,920
Good morning, everyone!

588
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,000
Sister Xingchen

589
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,070
How come you come back to work so soon?

590
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,820
I'm alright!

591
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,100
I'm invigorated with life again!

592
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,350
Let me check my little princess

593
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,170
My great savior!

594
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,100
You're finally back

595
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,770
Alright!

596
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,000
Come on!

597
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,540
Director Huang, why do you look haggard today?

598
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,750
Don't mention it!

599
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,120
Our boss is on the business trip

600
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,650
I need to take care of this family instead of him

601
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,770
That frustrated me a lot!

602
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,770
On business trip?

603
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,850
Yes, with Mr. Zhao

604
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,220
How's your recovery going?

605
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,920
Sorry. I'm so sorry

606
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,300
Sister Xingchen

607
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,220
Director Huang,

608
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,020
Sorry, I'm late!

609
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,800
I'm telling you

610
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,220
If you'll be late

611
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,320
once more,

612
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,250
I'll mercilessly...

613
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:31,400
Happy birthday to you!

614
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,000
Thank you! Happy birthday!

615
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,370
Thank you! Sister Xingchen

616
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,900
I'm just discharged from the hospital. I'll make up the gift for you later

617
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:37,670
Thank you!

618
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,820
Give me a hug!

619
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,220
Thank you a lot!

620
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,900
You touched me so much

621
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,270
Our little Tong Xin

622
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,720
You're dressed elegantly today

623
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,920
It's my birthday!

624
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,500
I want to have a fresh start

625
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,900
A fresh start!

626
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,820
Let me give a suggestion

627
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,750
How about we'll hold a

628
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,000
birthday party for my beloved "big head"

629
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,470
this night?

630
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,620
OK! OK!

631
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,300
Don't bother! Don't bother!

632
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,720
I mean we can do that another day

633
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:10,000
I want to celebrate it with my boyfriend tonight

634
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,250
Oh? What a married girl!

635
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,520
Sorry

636
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,370
You're unwilling to celebrate the birthday party with us?

637
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,750
It isn't the way you think

638
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,870
I'll definitely treat you to dinner tomorrow!

639
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,070
Come on

640
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,470
Tomorrow! Keep in mind

641
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,750
Thank you!

642
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,420
Sorry!

643
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,820
The subscriber you dialed is power off

644
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,970
How childish!

645
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,800
When on earth do you want to hide from me?

646
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,570
Hello, mom

647
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:01,820
Xingxing

648
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,970
Are you working now?

649
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:03,920
Is it convenient for you to speak?

650
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,100
Yes, go ahead!

651
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,370
Do you still

652
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,970
remember my high school classmate

653
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:09,920
aunt Cui?

654
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,520
What's the matter?

655
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,420
Yesterday, we

656
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,370
had a classmate union party

657
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,420
Then I knew

658
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,800
one of her nephew also works in Jinghai

659
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,500
He seems to be a R&D engineer

660
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,620
Anyway, he's a highly educated talent

661
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,720
I think

662
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,200
you can meet and know each other

663
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,200
Mom, how many times have I told you

664
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,370
Don't arrange blind date for me again!

665
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,320
I'm really not intended to do that

666
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,200
Then how old are you going to make that plan?

667
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,100
By the way

668
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,050
Is the boss of your company still chasing you?

669
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,120
Mom, why do you shift to talk about my boss?

670
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,950
Hold on, mom

671
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,700
I think it's good for me to know a friend even

672
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,120
we cannot be lover

673
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,750
You said it yourself

674
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,950
Don't take back your words!

675
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,370
Absolutely not!

676
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,570
Maybe my happiness depends on him

677
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:03,570
Okay! Okay! Okay!

678
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,720
I'm making an appointment for you

679
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,300
I'll go on with my work!

680
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,800
Okay! Okay! Go ahead!

681
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,420
What are we playing?

682
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,400
Is that game that who will lose if he speaks first?

683
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:43,850
Such IQ like yours

684
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,650
cannot used on the negotiating table already

685
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,450
It's so strange for two men to chat together

686
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,650
I have nothing to say to you

687
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,470
You're going to hide from

688
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,620
Xingchen to go on a business trip suddenly, right?

689
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,120
You're overthinking!

690
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,300
I simply don't trust you

691
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,900
Is it convenient for a voice call?

692
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,750
Xingchen

693
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,870
Let me check if you're disfigured

694
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,700
I'm fine

695
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,620
You're talking nonsense

696
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,250
Let me tell you something. I'm just about to

697
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,300
go to a blind date

698
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,150
I'm calling to tell you that

699
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,870
Blind date?

700
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,400
A moment please!

701
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,220
It's a little dark here

702
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,250
It isn't okay here

703
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,420
Here! It's alright here!

704
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,420
Blind date?

705
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,150
You mom arranged a blind date for you, right?

706
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,150
A senior engineer in the internet industry

707
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,200
She's made an appointment

708
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,350
Maybe I'll meet with him the day after tomorrow

709
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,650
The day after tomorrow!

710
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,520
The day after tomorrow

711
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,420
It's Valentine's Day the day after tomorrow!

712
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,420
Great!

713
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,800
It was me who to be your company

714
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,850
You have new company this year

715
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:01,800
There's finally a substitution this year!

716
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,250
I'm going to meet with him first

717
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,670
If I think he's alright,

718
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,820
we can also develop a relationship

719
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,200
You're right!

720
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,070
People with poor memory should throw away

721
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,850
otherwise, it's just like a timebomb

722
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,420
Yan Jingzhi is gone

723
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,720
Your goal's been achieved!

724
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,100
Thank you, Yuanfang

725
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,320
It's okay

726
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,050
Don't worry!

727
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:37,370
I'll keep an eye on him for you!

728
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:38,650
I'm hanging up!

729
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:39,370
I'll eat

730
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,270
Well

731
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:00,650
Where are the photos?

732
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,020
I'm a serious doctor

733
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,870
but not a paparazzi of you

734
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,250
The public welfare fund is donated to your hospital...

735
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,550
Dr. Han

736
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,370
I'm here for ward rounds

737
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:46,970
But I forgot my medical record book

738
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,320
I'll be back later

739
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,220
He's strange!
