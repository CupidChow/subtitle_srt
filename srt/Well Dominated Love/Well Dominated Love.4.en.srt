1
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,110
Miss Ailu

2
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,610
If I don't get the boss's signature,

3
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,540
how can I tell my sisters

4
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,540
Why do your sisters

5
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,290
ask for the boss's signature again?

6
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,210
You don't understand

7
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,690
Outstanding people will be liked by everyone

8
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,760
especially people like our boss

9
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,310
who are capable and handsome

10
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,140
and hard-working,

11
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,440
not only unmarried

12
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,890
but also under thirty

13
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,010
It's not comprehensive at all

14
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,860
Don't blame me for criticizing you

15
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,460
Mr. Yan's

16
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,490
shoulders are so flat

17
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,010
with straight back

18
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,560
He's serious in normal time

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,140
but cute like a deer when he smiles

20
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,310
Yeah

21
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,710
Even uncle Huang

22
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,090
and brother Huang said that

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,210
Then we can say Mr. Yan is really a handsome guy

24
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,840
Why doesn't Xingchen

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,140
submit the proposal for try

26
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:28,960
Just...

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,660
What proposal?

28
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,910
Mr. Yan

29
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,640
Mr. Yan

30
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,560
I've arranged to have that video down as soon as possible

31
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,410
But because of the wide range of forwarding

32
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,740
It may take a day

33
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,310
Why the plan about daily routine of CEO

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,690
didn't come up

35
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,940
I take into account your desire for privacy

36
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,840
So I think

37
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,740
this plan is great

38
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,290
But...

39
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,960
I don't like strangers shooting around me

40
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,510
Then I will trouble Secretary Nie

41
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,060
to be my photographer

42
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,360
I am not professional on photography

43
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,290
It is better to ask the Publicity Department take pictures

44
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,590
Since the theme is about daily life,

45
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,660
my home will definitely be filmed

46
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,090
My house is not mock-up

47
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,460
Is it for people to visit?

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,540
Mr. Yan and Xingchen

49
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,510
Actually shooting daily life materials

50
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,810
doesn't need to be skillful

51
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,210
Maybe Xingchen can shoot it at first

52
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,940
and then it will be edited by the Publicity Department

53
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,410
Done!

54
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,340
Arrange it

55
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,010
Yeah

56
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,360
Secretary Tong

57
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,140
I hope the employees

58
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,590
can focus on their work

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,090
rather than on chasing stars

60
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,860
Yeah

61
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,240
You can go out

62
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,810
Mr. Yan

63
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,610
Secretary Nie

64
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,990
You are so capable

65
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,040
That's a piece of cake for you

66
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,410
Do you

67
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,640
still mind what happened before？

68
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,760
No problem, Mr. Yan

69
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,090
I will try my best for this mission

70
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,840
Hold on!

71
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,310
What do my fans call me?

72
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,940
Forget so soon

73
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,090
Good morning, Secretary Nie

74
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,910
Good morning, Mr. Yan

75
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,590
You can start

76
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,340
before the breakfast

77
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:23,960
OK

78
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,510
We will carry on tonight

79
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,660
Mr. Yan,

80
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,490
you must be tired today

81
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,110
Why don't we go back and rest

82
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,090
and do it tomorrow

83
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,860
Is it ok

84
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,810
It is work

85
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,140
I want to live up to those

86
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,210
who call me honey

87
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,890
My phone

88
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,210
Thanks, Mr. Yan

89
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,340
Secretary Nie

90
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,660
Is there any reward

91
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,510
What are you doing

92
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,340
Your breathing is a little disordered

93
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,760
You sense is wrong

94
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,440
Let me feel it again

95
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,390
Mr. Yan

96
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,140
That's enough for today

97
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,390
I should go back to sort these materials

98
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,710
What's up!

99
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,090
Let me help you

100
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,390
Your breath is a bit messy

101
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,110
You sense is wrong

102
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,660
Let me feel it again

103
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,910
Don't even think about it

104
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,410
I'm out of my mind

105
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,590
I learned it myself

106
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,140
OK

107
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,760
So let's start with these fifteen questions

108
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,290
If there is any new situation on the air

109
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,540
Tell me in time

110
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,660
You also keep records in time

111
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,140
You need to do data and traffic monitoring

112
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,110
Understood

113
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,160
Then we can keep in touch at any time if there is any problem

114
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,340
OK

115
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,540
Mr. Yan

116
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,760
There are some questions collected by Publicity Department

117
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,910
according to that proposed by fans

118
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,740
Is there anything inconvenient for you to answer?

119
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,940
We can remove in advance

120
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,360
Let’s call it a day!

121
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,240
OK

122
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,660
Let's get start when time is up

123
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,160
Okay

124
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,190
Mr. Yan

125
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,910
Hello

126
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,490
Hello

127
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,440
Hello

128
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,610
Hello

129
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,260
Hello

130
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,990
Hello everyone

131
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,640
Mr. Yan

132
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,140
Mr. Yan

133
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,940
No, Mr. Yan

134
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,460
Questions

135
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,040
What are your hobbies?

136
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,460
Working

137
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,060
What is the first thing you do after getting up

138
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,310
Working while eating breakfast

139
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,940
What is your biggest pet peeves?

140
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,640
People make mistake in their work

141
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,940
Boss's life is so boring

142
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,810
with no life outside of work

143
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,660
That's why the profits of our company

144
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,860
are doubling every year

145
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,010
We have an excellent boss

146
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,990
It's our honor

147
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,960
Where would you like to travel most?

148
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,910
I usually go out of town on business

149
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,660
That's all the questions

150
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,290
Mr. Yan!

151
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,540
Mr. Yan

152
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,340
My husband approached

153
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,960
Boss, do you still need a cleaner in your company

154
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,110
I can do it

155
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,640
The CEO of other company

156
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,360
I'm crazy about him

157
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,040
Next

158
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,760
I'm going to extract a couple of questions

159
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,410
What is your favorite color?

160
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,840
Blue

161
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,260
Your favorite drink?

162
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,560
Water

163
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,090
What is your ideal type about girlfriend?

164
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,010
I like girl with ponytail

165
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,640
big eyes, doubled-fold eyelids, high-bridged nose

166
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,810
fair-skinned,

167
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,240
who love wearing suits,

168
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,640
high heels

169
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,440
Height

170
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,610
is up to here

171
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,360
OK, we are done for today's live

172
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,610
Secretary Nie

173
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,990
Remember to give a gift for

174
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,260
each of the fans who asked a question

175
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,110
especially for

176
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,060
who ask me about my ideal girlfriend type

177
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
All right, Mr. Yan

178
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,490
I like girl with ponytail

179
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,140
big eyes, doubled-fold eyelids, high-bridged nose

180
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,210
fair-skinned

181
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,390
who love wearing suits,

182
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,560
high heels

183
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,660
the height is up to here

184
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,490
Why

185
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,360
the boss described it in such specific way

186
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,940
Could it because he already have someone

187
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,390
Doubled-fold eyelids,

188
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,360
fair-skinned,

189
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,640
ponytail

190
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,140
Oh I know who it is

191
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:20,810
Who is it?

192
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,540
Who is it?

193
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,810
It is so obvious

194
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,660
Are you talking about yourself?

195
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:28,690
Of course

196
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,940
Clearly

197
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,810
Xingchen

198
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,860
Maybe it is me

199
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,890
Hold on

200
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,260
You seem to fit the bill perfectly

201
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,590
My first reaction just also Xingchen

202
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,510
No way

203
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,740
Alright

204
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,840
You guys are so gossipy

205
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,760
with bigmouth

206
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,160
Why are you gossiping?

207
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,340
But I think it seems like

208
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,810
Xiaoli from the Design Department

209
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,660
Maybe Mr. Yan wants to

210
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,590
maximize the publicity

211
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,460
Yes, yes

212
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,690
Oh!

213
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,310
Our boss is so wise

214
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,690
that he totally grasped the essence of communication

215
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,190
Yeah

216
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,860
Anyway

217
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,840
Our boss

218
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,410
spares no effort in leading us

219
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,010
until one's death

220
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,240
No

221
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,740
It is self-sacrifice

222
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,740
die game

223
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,940
No, no, no

224
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,810
Anyway

225
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,960
he devoted a lot for the company

226
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,290
So what we going to do

227
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,360
We...

228
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,710
We should get to work hard

229
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,310
Hurry up

230
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,910
We must not disappoint our boss

231
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,160
for sacrificing himself

232
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,640
No

233
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,560
How could you use the term of death

234
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,440
Quickly, let's get to work

235
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,090
Come on

236
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,810
Hello Mr. Yan

237
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,440
Hello Mr. Yan

238
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,190
Good morning, Mr. Yan

239
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,590
Good morning, Mr. Yan

240
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,610
Eh

241
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,410
What's going on?

242
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,390
Hello, Mr. Yan

243
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,940
They all

244
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,290
want to be your type

245
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,160
After they watched your live,

246
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,910
they were all guessing

247
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,040
the girl you like

248
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,760
must in our company

249
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,460
Then they all guess who it is

250
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,390
They think anyone is possible to be the one

251
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,310
But we think that

252
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,710
you like secretary Nie

253
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,310
What did secretary Nie say

254
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:28,990
Mr. Yan

255
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,040
I know secretary Nie

256
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,640
I can guarantee that with my job prospects

257
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,760
Secretary Nie is absolutely committed to her job

258
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,810
I'm sure she doesn't have inordinate ambition on you

259
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,610
And she is professional,

260
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,110
you can totally trust her

261
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,990
Let me tell you a secret

262
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,510
Secretary Nie

263
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,860
She seems to have a crush on Mr. Zhao

264
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,740
You mean that I am not as good as Zhao Yuanfang

265
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,690
Of course

266
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,890
No! No! No!

267
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,090
I didn't mean that

268
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,810
I didn't say that

269
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,840
It's Ailu

270
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,190
Ailu saw that

271
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,690
You are the

272
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,760
best in our company

273
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,210
How can Zhao Yuanfang compare with you

274
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,640
If I am a girl,

275
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,160
I might like you

276
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,160
So you mean

277
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,710
They all like me

278
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,790
Of course

279
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,290
They are not blind

280
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:15,810
Director Huang

281
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,410
You have a good taste

282
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,060
I believe in you

283
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,060
Me?

284
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,390
Good morning, Mr. Yan

285
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,710
Sister,

286
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,760
remember to take pictures of us

287
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,660
Heart

288
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,090
She finally

289
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,710
felt my charm?

290
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,060
What do you come to me for?

291
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,490
No, nothing

292
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,560
But, I have

293
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,940
Where is the minutes of yesterday

294
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,960
I put it on your desk

295
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,860
Well I didn't see that

296
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,790
Then I'll look for it for you

297
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,690
When I say no, I mean no

298
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,060
Are you questioning me?

299
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,090
I'll look outside

300
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,090
Let me print another one for you

301
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,840
Secretary Nie

302
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,410
Were you taking pictures of me

303
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,760
I...

304
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,060
I'll get up and talk to you

305
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,160
Honestly,

306
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,710
do you like me

307
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,410
I'm sorry, Mr. Yan

308
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,410
I didn't mean to do that

309
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,890
I just want to send the pictures to the fans

310
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,440
Secretary Nie

311
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,660
I always believe that you have a professional

312
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,060
working spirit

313
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,990
I didn't realize you were

314
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,410
hooking up with a bunch of high-energy fans

315
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,610
to talk about my life

316
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,210
I'm sorry, Mr. Yan

317
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,490
Take down all videos immediately

318
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,510
Stop all photos and propaganda immediately

319
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,460
Right now

320
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,010
All right, Mr. Yan

321
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,360
At the swimming pool last night,

322
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,860
haven't you had a heartbeat for a moment

323
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,940
Have you ever heard of the drawbridge effect

324
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,560
When a person

325
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,490
walking nervously on the drawbridge,

326
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,510
he will spontaneously heartbeat

327
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,160
If you meet a person with opposite sex,

328
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,160
you will regard this heartbeat

329
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,210
as love

330
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,210
The same is true after exercise

331
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,010
Your brain releases dopamine quickly

332
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,990
that gives you the illusion of being in love

333
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,560
You mean

334
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,390
I misunderstood your heartbeat

335
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,410
It was a misunderstanding

336
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,510
Mr. Yan

337
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,710
I'm leaving my job soon

338
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,040
But before that

339
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,340
I hope we can leave a good impression to each other

340
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,160
By the way

341
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,810
I remember that

342
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,340
I put the minutes on your desk

343
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,640
I've already read the minutes of the meeting

344
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,040
Dr. Han

345
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,610
Dr. Han

346
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,040
Wait for me Dr. Han

347
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,260
Wait for me, Dr. Han

348
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,210
Dr. Han

349
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,140
We meet again

350
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,310
Miss Tong

351
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,560
I'm off work

352
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,390
I know

353
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,190
I want to say

354
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,110
You have a flat tire

355
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,940
There's nothing on the dashboard

356
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,760
But I did see it when I came here

357
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,790
It is distorted

358
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,590
Dr. Han

359
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,790
It's dangerous for you to go home like this

360
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,040
Your next step

361
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,610
is not to send me home, right?

362
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,140
I did drive here today

363
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,260
Miss Tong

364
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,860
What exactly do you want to do?

365
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,040
Dr. Han

366
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,410
I bring you some snacks

367
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,310
Today, my boss

368
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,960
ask me to take the video offline

369
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,360
So I missed your appointment

370
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,090
This restaurant is very good

371
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,840
It took a long time to get the seat

372
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,740
Have a try

373
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,510
Would you please leave my seat first

374
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,510
Well, can you try it first

375
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,310
Preserved food

376
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,860
will affect my mucous membrane system

377
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,260
and it is bad for my stomach

378
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,440
It is junk food

379
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,240
But eat it once in a while

380
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,340
is fine

381
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,660
I'm not going to eat that

382
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,890
Dr. Han

383
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,320
I will bring healthy food to you next time

384
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,790
So you came here to bring me food

385
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,460
Yeah

386
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,540
To support you

387
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,740
is the professionalism to be professional fans of you

388
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,510
Dr. Han

389
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,040
Please fasten the seat belt

390
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,110
It's also about being a civilized passenger

391
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,240
with professional quality

392
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,040
I'm taking you home

393
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,540
Great!

394
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,560
So you came here to bring me food

395
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,390
Yeah

396
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,410
To support you

397
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,710
is the professionalism to be professional fans of you

398
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,740
This restaurant is very good

399
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,660
It took a long time to get the seat

400
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,560
Have a try

401
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,490
What are you doing here?

402
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,440
Wait

403
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,890
What did you want me to do just now?

404
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,540
Can you be serious?

405
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,840
I want you to help me to pursue Nie Xingchen

406
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,490
There is a mere exposure effect in psychology

407
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,910
that means if a person

408
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,610
keep showing in your life,

409
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,610
you will fall in love with her

410
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,010
So what do you want to say

411
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,490
So

412
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,240
Are you sure it's not because that

413
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,940
you can see her every day?

414
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,210
I won't fall in love with every one of my secretaries

415
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,290
and I know my emotional state

416
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,210
So is there any way

417
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:07,960
Yes

418
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,090
You can make someone you love fall in love with you

419
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,190
There are eighty-five of

420
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,490
scientifically proven love tips

421
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,090
I wish you could find your true love

422
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,140
When I was in my psychology class,

423
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,440
I bought a lot of books like this

424
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,910
to learn some tips

425
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,890
You can keep them

426
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,890
I forgot

427
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,960
because you couldn't understand women,

428
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,610
so you gave up your psychology degree

429
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,760
It is useless to ask you

430
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,840
Never mind

431
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,010
See you

432
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,390
By the way

433
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,890
Do you know globefish

434
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,890
What are you going to teach me again?

435
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,310
When the male puffer is courting,

436
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,760
they use their fins

437
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,420
to create a delicate pattern in the sand at the bottom of the sea

438
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,340
Sometimes

439
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,540
they even use shell to decorate their works

440
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,260
So what do you want to say?

441
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,390
So

442
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,410
No matter it is people or animal

443
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,560
When they are courting,

444
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,610
it is necessary to send something

445
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,010
It sounds reasonable

446
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,290
Come on, Tongxin, hurry up

447
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:28,760
Come and take pictures

448
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,790
I've already taken pictures

449
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,390
This way, this way

450
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:30,860
Tong Xin

451
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,610
Chief, you've taken dozens of pictures

452
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,860
What is this?

453
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,510
Miss Xingchen

454
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,240
Ailu

455
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,710
Someone proposed to you, this morning?

456
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,790
It is not mine

457
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,910
Miss Xingchen

458
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,460
You are so unkind

459
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,610
and ungenerous

460
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,010
It's such a big deal

461
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,460
Why don't you tell us

462
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,190
Here you are

463
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,360
These are all mine

464
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,090
Yeah

465
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,860
Who send them to me?

466
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,340
I don't know

467
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,090
But I saw your name on the delivery slip

468
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,490
I told them to put it down

469
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,490
It must be your boyfriend

470
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,360
But I don't have a boyfriend

471
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,860
Miss Xingchen

472
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,610
Why don't you open it and see what's inside

473
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,360
Why not?

474
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,840
I advise you not to get excited

475
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,500
According to my experience

476
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,890
It's not worth more than this bouquet of flowers

477
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,290
Typical jealous feeling

478
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,490
Secretary Nie

479
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,190
Yes or No

480
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,210
Silence is approval

481
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,560
So let's open it

482
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,810
One, two, three, go

483
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,260
My god

484
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,840
It's very hard to buy

485
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,440
My friend went abroad to buy for others

486
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,410
But out of stock

487
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,840
Then I bought it for you

488
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,140
to offset my meal expense

489
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,810
I don't want a knockoff

490
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,190
Xingchen

491
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,710
Can I smell it

492
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,840
That's the taste

493
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,910
I'm sorry

494
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,860
This is the lipstick I've been looking for a long time

495
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,860
and there are so many of them

496
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,490
Look!

497
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,210
Barbie pink lipstick

498
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,210
Hold on

499
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,390
Your boyfriend

500
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,210
will not be the person who are addicted to pink

501
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,810
I really don't have a boyfriend

502
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,460
Then it is your wooer

503
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,610
Secret admirer

504
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,960
Is he in our company?

505
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,260
Which department?

506
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,690
Do we know him

507
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,490
I don't know

508
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,190
Of course we know him

509
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,540
Mr. Zhao!

510
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,940
Do you like it?

511
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,190
I like it

512
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,540
What are you doing?

513
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,260
Well

514
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
Couldn't you have told me in advance

515
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,210
And today is not even my birthday

516
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,340
Why are you preparing this

517
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,540
Madam

518
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,210
My taste is not that bad

519
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,690
All pink

520
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,040
This kind of taste is like

521
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,460
a countrified man who often recognize orange and pink as red

522
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,090
I just see you don't know how to answer

523
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,310
So I am trying to help you

524
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,460
Blame me!

525
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,340
It's not you

526
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,790
Who is...

527
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,110
I will return it

528
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,440
And leave this secret thing for me

529
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,660
I will handle that

530
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,440
It seems funny

531
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,640
Come in

532
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,490
How could it be you?

533
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,460
Mr. Yan

534
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,390
The flowers

535
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,740
I send them back

536
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,540
The presents

537
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,060
I disposed it for you

538
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,140
I will send the presents of my girlfriend personally

539
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,210
No need to bother you

540
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,590
Your girlfriend?

541
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,560
I told you before

542
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,710
You can't have such a bad memory

543
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,360
If secretary Nie

544
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,960
is your girlfriend,

545
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,190
then why there's nothing

546
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,660
that related to you in her house

547
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,260
As far as I know,

548
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,740
you've had at least ten girlfriends in the last five years

549
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,510
Secretary Nie is so smart

550
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,760
She should not have relation with you

551
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,840
Mr. Yan

552
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,690
This is about us

553
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,490
It's none of your business

554
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,440
Why?

555
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,960
If secretary Nie is single,

556
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,210
I have right to pursue her

557
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,790
Xingchen also have right to reject you

558
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,810
Mr. Yan

559
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,640
You are so arrogant

560
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,490
Don't give anyone the chance to turn you down

561
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,390
I'm gonna go, Mr. Yan

562
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,610
Han Ziyu is a fake expert

563
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,510
Just bad idea

564
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,960
You'll have to

565
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,060
reimburse me

566
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,160
Why should I pay

567
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,890
Even a headache

568
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,390
could be neuralgia, or

569
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,340
intracranial hemorrhage

570
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,290
Or... Alright

571
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,760
Can you come to the point

572
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,860
So the point is

573
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,660
We doctors should suit remedy to the case

574
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,960
pursuing girls are the same

575
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,590
You mean...

576
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,640
She didn't like the things I gave her

577
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,540
Maybe

578
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,110
You need to send her something she likes

579
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,910
rather than things you believe she might like

580
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,810
Or...

581
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,190
You should ask her straightly

582
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:40,810
Ah

583
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,490
She wouldn't say

584
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,210
Your majesty, Mr. Yan

585
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,360
If you want to know a person in modern life,

586
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,760
there are many ways

587
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:50,960
For example

588
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,160
WeChat Moments

589
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,610
WeChat Moments

590
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,990
A doctor still has time to refresh Moments?

591
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,610
Remember to pay the bill for me

592
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,210
I am busy

593
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,590
I don't have time to pay the bill for you

594
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,410
Walking backwards

595
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,140
after meal

596
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,590
is good for digestion

597
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,090
Slow down

598
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,040
Don't fall

599
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,890
I'm not scared

600
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:18,460
cuz I have you to keep an eye on me,

601
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:18,860
Don’t you?

602
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,010
Mr. Yan

603
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,160
Let's go and have a meal

604
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,840
Mr. Yan

605
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,290
Can I ask you something?

606
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,460
Can you see Nie's WeChat Moments

607
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,710
Yes!

608
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,960
Yes I can

609
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Just now

610
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,690
I saw her shared a song on Moments

611
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,890
So if you can't see a person's circle of friends

612
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,990
What does that mean

613
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,660
That means you are been blocked by her

614
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,040
Yes, blocked

615
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,260
Mr. Yan

616
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:50,960
I see

617
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,610
Nie must block Mr. Yan

618
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,940
Why?

619
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,810
Just think

620
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,640
Working during the day is tiring enough

621
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,690
Who wants be stared at by the boss after work

622
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,990
But Secretary Nie is too inflexible

623
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,310
She could grouping her contacts

624
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:11,890
Grouping

625
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,990
Director

626
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,710
I am frank and forthright

627
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,640
I will not grouping my contacts

628
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,810
I often give mass texting

629
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,660
Well, hurry up

630
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,640
We will be late for work

631
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,510
Go, go, go

632
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,890
Mr. Yan, your tea

633
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:33,690
Thanks

634
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,560
Secretary Nie

635
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,560
I can't figure out the format of this computer

636
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,490
Could you please give me a hand?

637
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,390
OK

638
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,410
Alright

639
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,090
Anything else, Mr. Yan?

640
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,460
Thank you

641
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,190
Mr. Yan

642
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,010
Thank you for your gifts today

643
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,990
But it is not appropriate

644
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,960
I hope

645
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,610
you won't do that again!

646
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,040
It will make trouble for other people in the office

647
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,710
Secretary Nie

648
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,410
Besides the relationship of leader and member

649
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,010
We are friends, I think

650
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,840
Sure

651
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,160
Now that we are friends,

652
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,860
why you block me?

653
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,310
How?

654
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,310
How would I know?

655
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,910
You think I don't like to see the Moments

656
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,140
And I will not know that?

657
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,340
Or...

658
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,310
You can give me a more reasonable explanation

659
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:03,480
I just want to separate my work with my life

660
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,660
and have my own private space

661
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,890
Why you are always making a clear distinction with me?

662
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,140
Is it because I mistook you for someone else?

663
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,490
I've explained to you

664
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,360
Mr. Yan, you misunderstand me!

665
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,610
I didn't mean that

666
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,790
So what do you have against me?

667
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,490
I really don't have any

668
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,010
May be because you are my boss

669
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,740
Once I think you could see my Moments

670
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,860
I can't

671
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,160
express my feelings truthfully

672
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,210
Zhao Yuanfang is also your boss

673
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,710
Do you block him?

674
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,040
I... I know

675
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,340
I thought we are friends...

676
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:44,940
Forget it

677
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,460
That's your right

678
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,260
I'm not qualified to require you

679
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,060
You can go out now

680
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:14,790
Mr. Yan

681
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,240
Indeed, I was thoughtless for that

682
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
I will not do that again

683
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,290
Sorry!

684
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,390
I just refreshed the Moments

685
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,740
Why just a smile?

686
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,760
What about two?

687
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,160
Can we be friends?

688
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,590
Don't be angry for others' silly things

689
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,540
Now be happy

690
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,940
Tomorrow is another day

691
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:14,540
Hello

692
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,710
Director Huang?

693
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,310
Do me a favor tomorrow

694
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,540
Look at this

695
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,740
This plan has changed

696
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,640
I will adjust it now

697
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
OK

698
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,110
Check again

699
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,710
OK, I will check again

700
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,410
Director Huang

701
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,110
Secretary Nie

702
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,660
I bought some barbarum

703
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,960
that's good for health

704
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,160
And I save one for you

705
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,460
You are so kind

706
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,960
Actually

707
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,940
I have one thing

708
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,110
that needs your help

709
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,690
Mr. Yan

710
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,810
asked me to

711
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,440
fetch something from him after work

712
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,140
But today, my wife is on duty

713
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,340
After work,

714
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,240
I have to pick up my child at school

715
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,840
Could you...

716
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,560
No problem

717
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,410
Send me the address

718
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,260
I'll go immediately when I get off work

719
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,260
Secretary Nie

720
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,640
That's very nice of you

721
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,190
So how can I express my thanks?

722
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,360
I already have barbarum

723
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,710
It is certainly not!

724
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,810
Er...

725
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,290
If you're not satisfied with Mr. Zhao

726
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,210
I will introduce you another boyfriend

727
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,960
Then

728
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,960
What about I introduce another to Mr. Zhao?

729
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,060
I won't disturb you

730
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,840
Secretary Nie

731
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,740
Good evening

732
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,090
What are you doing here, Mr. Yan?

733
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,010
You let Director Huang cheat me to this place?

734
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,040
In secretary Nie's heart

735
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,790
I am that kind of person

736
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,710
I didn't mean it

737
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,510
But these...

738
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,390
Mr. Yan, I've already told you. I...

739
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,010
My company just acquired

740
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,340
a UAV company

741
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,890
and is testing their new products

742
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,790
I see

743
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,440
If you have anything about our work,

744
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,940
you can tell me directly

745
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,440
I am afraid that you misunderstand

746
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,110
and find excuses to refuse me

747
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,790
Go

748
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:07,990
Where to go?

749
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,140
I haven't have dinner

750
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,960
Together?

751
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,160
Do something

752
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,240
that she doesn't expect

753
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,360
can change her opinion on you effectively,

754
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,540
such as

755
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,040
showing a sign of weakness

756
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,590
What an awful book!
