1
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:00,890
Zhao Yuanfang

2
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,080
Don't be moved

3
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,210
I picked it up from the trash downstairs

4
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:06,945
Well done

5
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,120
You're not giving up on yourself

6
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,680
Good job

7
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,300
Be my style

8
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,410
Change shoes

9
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,830
Do it later, please

10
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,870
It's not your house

11
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,250
I'll do it in my house

12
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,800
Why give me flowers?

13
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,790
To celebrate your unemployment

14
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,510
That's going to cost you

15
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,510
The flowers are good

16
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,720
I heard that

17
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,870
A busy man may

18
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,050
be used to being busy

19
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,550
How're you feeling now?

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,180
I don't know who to blame

21
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,320
for being so busy these five years

22
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,290
The abler a man, the busier he gets

23
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,230
Are you in a good mood these two days?

24
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,650
Fine

25
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,660
No 797 anymore

26
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,460
Who unhappy?

27
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,010
What is 797?

28
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,350
Working at 7:00 a.m.

29
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,470
Off duty at 9:00 p.m.

30
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,270
Working seven days a week

31
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,300
Oh my God

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,750
Is Yan Jingzhi exploiting you so much?

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,640
Yes

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,840
Are you ok?

35
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,320
We don't have relationship anymore

36
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,250
I see

37
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,170
You resigned

38
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,250
He knows what happened before

39
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,180
How?

40
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,600
By default

41
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,740
And fate plays tricks

42
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm tired of lying anyway

43
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,600
That's it

44
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,410
All in all

45
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,970
Yan Jingzhi won't forgive me any more

46
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,340
After all, it was the first time

47
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,230
he'd been played around

48
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,230
You've already left him aside?

49
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,490
All right

50
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,180
Forget unhappy things

51
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:41,800
Let's go

52
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,890
Take a walk with me

53
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,460
Where to go?

54
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,970
Travel

55
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,460
Just as reward

56
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,950
for your hard work these five years

57
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,600
No

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,090
I haven't find a job

59
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,670
The house I saw last time was bought by someone else

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,370
I don't have enough down payment

61
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,410
for those in equal condition

62
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,700
Just follow me

63
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,840
I can buy for you

64
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,440
Well

65
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,130
Give me your money

66
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,500
I've contacted these companies

67
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,630
for you

68
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,530
Just go

69
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,660
whenever you want

70
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,390
And don't worry about it

71
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,430
I've talked about the salary

72
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,660
You can get higher pay than before

73
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,460
In fact

74
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,640
I want to try it by myself

75
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,230
After all, I haven't had an interview in five years

76
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,730
I want to see what I'm capable of

77
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,050
Okay

78
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,970
As you happy

79
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,470
But keep the card

80
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,640
Think about it when

81
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,760
you feel good

82
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,480
Okay

83
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,780
Thank you

84
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,160
You should go

85
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,910
You wish

86
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,950
What kind of food do you have?

87
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,790
I didn't have breakfast today

88
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,430
I just get up

89
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,390
You're still sleepy?

90
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,420
Sleep together for a while?

91
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,780
Egg noodle

92
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,480
Add one more egg, please

93
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,200
Xingchen

94
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,510
Egg noodles should put

95
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,450
more eggs

96
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,780
You can eat eggs

97
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
And I eat noodles

98
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,540
Okay

99
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,690
You send flowers today

100
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,490
So it's up to you

101
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,390
Do you like it?

102
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,000
Love you!

103
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,750
So happy

104
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,780
Secretary Tong

105
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:35,750
Mr. Yan

106
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,230
Call Zhao Yuanfang

107
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,750
He asked for a leave

108
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,870
What reason?

109
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,450
I think it's wedding leave

110
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,140
What?

111
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,480
Just go

112
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,770
Sorry

113
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,140
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment,

114
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,850
please redial later

115
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,390
Sorry

116
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,790
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment,

117
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,680
please redial later

118
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,330
Eat noodle

119
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,250
Are you that sleepy?

120
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,000
I said let's sleep together

121
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,980
You don't want to have noodles?

122
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,720
Ok, Ok

123
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,540
Who's it?

124
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,860
A douchebag

125
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,990
Just answer it

126
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,290
Don't delay your work

127
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,170
Xingchen

128
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,180
You are no longer a Secretary

129
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,330
Put your professional instincts aside

130
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,110
Be a good housewife

131
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,900
Just eating

132
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,900
Ok, Ok

133
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,530
But

134
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,940
The noodle is very delicious

135
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,670
Otherwise I invite you

136
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,340
to be my personal private chef

137
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,290
You mean Aunt Zhao?

138
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,130
I'm serious

139
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,440
I swear on my luck in love

140
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,460
And

141
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,970
You and Yan Jingzhi

142
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,920
may impossible

143
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,770
Why don't we make a contract marriage

144
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,700
like that in the movies

145
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,000
You can do whatever you want

146
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,640
Just for a bowl of noodles? You're crazy

147
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,350
It is not just a bowl of noodle

148
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,640
It is forever noodles

149
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,410
Forever, you know?

150
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,910
Zhao Yuanfang, you're annoying

151
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,540
Too tired to follow you

152
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,650
I'll get you a glass of water

153
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,700
Hello, Mr. Yan

154
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,050
I heard you asked for leave?

155
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,900
Yes, Mr. Yan

156
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,340
What's the matter?

157
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,110
Is there something wrong?

158
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,910
You're on wedding leave?

159
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:55,840
Xingchen

160
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,130
I want to eat grapes

161
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,640
that I can eat directly

162
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,140
Put in my mouth one by one

163
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,050
Sure

164
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,800
Mr. Yan

165
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,570
What's the matter?

166
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,190
How's the opening plan for the mall going?

167
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,180
Well

168
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,630
No finish yet

169
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,260
As soon as possible

170
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,210
Give me within this week

171
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,220
This week?

172
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,340
The time is too...

173
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,760
You should have to solve the problem

174
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,520
I...

175
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,870
Oh my God

176
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,170
It is difficult

177
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,750
What did you say?

178
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,730
Well

179
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,030
Do you want to eat grapes?

180
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,910
I can buy for you

181
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,720
that you can eat directly

182
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,370
Put in your mouth one by one

183
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,390
You're crazy

184
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,080
When is this going to end?

185
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,580
I haven't watched J's live

186
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,840
for three days

187
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,850
Three days!

188
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,260
Oh no!

189
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
My dark under-eye circles

190
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,430
Even expensive eye cream can't help

191
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,890
I've never worked so hard like this

192
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,780
Working is never done!

193
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,490
Guys

194
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,130
Have some of that hawthorn water

195
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,320
to relieve inflammation or internal heat

196
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,660
before your voice is getting hoarse like me

197
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,180
I wish Xingchen was here

198
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,560
Miss Xingchen

199
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,300
Oh

200
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,450
Secretary Tong

201
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:21,980
Mr. Yan

202
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,910
What the hell is this?

203
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,080
What seems to be bothering you?

204
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,370
So

205
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,930
How do you know when I love play Minesweeper

206
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,680
when I'm in a bad mood

207
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,120
Xingchen told me

208
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,760
You asked her?

209
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,370
No

210
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,920
Xingchen left me a note

211
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,910
before she left

212
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,170
on which these are written

213
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,070
Where is it?

214
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,950
How was it?

215
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,820
Mr. Yan said we can off duty

216
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,580
Really?

217
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,750
There's no overtime today?

218
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,720
Xingchen really has ideas

219
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,150
Wait, wait, wait

220
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,130
Why do you look so unhappy?

221
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,840
I forgot to copy

222
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,550
the note that Xingchen gave me

223
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,870
It's nothing serious

224
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,460
Just call her

225
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:47,950
That's right!

226
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,970
Call her

227
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,540
Director Huang

228
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,820
You're such a brain!

229
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,600
You are also my lifeline

230
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,510
Wow! What time is it?

231
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,410
What time is it?

232
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,760
I'm late for the fan meeting

233
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,450
I'm leaving now

234
00:11:59,600 --> 00:11:59,980
Bye

235
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,090
Bye-bye. Let's..

236
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,780
Let's get off work

237
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,420
Just go!

238
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,000
Get off work!

239
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,330
I'll go to have a facial massage and do nail painting

240
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,220
I'm exhausted

241
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,550
I'm leaving. Bye

242
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,550
Bye-bye

243
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,370
Thank you

244
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,110
Dr. Han

245
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,600
Let me cut it for you

246
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,110
No, thanks

247
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,020
Your hands are for holding the scalpel

248
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,160
They are used to cure the sickness and save the patient

249
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,390
Just leave it to me

250
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,630
Miss Tong

251
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,460
I'm just an ordinary doctor

252
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,210
I‘m not an idol

253
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,780
So that I think you can deserve more respect

254
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,520
Because you are the angel in white

255
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,000
By the way, Dr. Han

256
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,980
Can I ask you a question?

257
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,890
You said it on a blind date that

258
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,950
you have never dated anyone before

259
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,080
Is it true?

260
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,130
Such event

261
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,870
It is no necessary to lie for me

262
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,510
But why?

263
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,740
You are so excellent!

264
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,340
Contacting with the opposite sex

265
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,750
makes my body uncomfortable

266
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,450
You have a phobia of women?

267
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,520
Do you have it when you're a child?

268
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,230
When I was in high school,

269
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,750
someone threw me down the stairs

270
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,250
after being rejected

271
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,400
From then on

272
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,690
I think girls are

273
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,190
horrible creatures

274
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,180
You're canceled!

275
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,940
It's really terrible

276
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,920
But Dr. Han, you can take it easy

277
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,160
I will never do that

278
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,390
Miss Tong

279
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,310
May I ask you a question?

280
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,830
Sure

281
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,090
Why do you fan stars?

282
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,760
I remember that in my senior year,

283
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,460
I was very, very confused

284
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,280
I didn't know what I can do after graduate

285
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,020
Until one day

286
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,990
I saw J's program on TV

287
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,560
I saw his determination and persistence

288
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,900
in his musical dreams

289
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,330
It really touched me

290
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,670
at that time

291
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,910
So I felt

292
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,750
I had courage and strength at that moment

293
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,240
So you take them

294
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,500
as a kind of spiritual sustenance

295
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,320
or a kind of faith

296
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,900
It can be described like that

297
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,350
He is my soul mate

298
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,590
And

299
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,620
Because of loving J,

300
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,560
I got a lot of friends

301
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,560
Do you know

302
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,010
When people who have the same hobby talk with each other,

303
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,960
all the worries and pressure will be forgotten

304
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,970
Dr. Han, have steak, please

305
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,660
Why not take the bus

306
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,480
instead of walking?

307
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,960
Digest

308
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,250
after dinner

309
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,790
And I'm happy

310
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,000
to walk with my idol

311
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,390
Dr. Han

312
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,090
Here's my home. Thank you

313
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,510
Then you go home and go to bed early

314
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,350
You look tired

315
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,500
Today is the earliest day

316
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,480
I left work

317
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,390
Mr. Yan will make us work overtime

318
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,660
when he's unhappy

319
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,530
What's wrong with him?

320
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,540
After Xingchen left,

321
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,900
maybe he's not used to it

322
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,760
Dr. Han

323
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,270
In fact

324
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,460
Female phobia is a relationship disorder

325
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,240
I know it

326
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,950
Well

327
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,550
You know

328
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,440
It can also be corrected with behavioral therapy

329
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,670
Today's desensitization therapy

330
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,720
Bye-bye, my idol

331
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,500
Don't worry

332
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,200
I will cure it for you

333
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,540
See you next time

334
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,340
Hey

335
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,030
Hey

336
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,630
Finally you answer my phone?

337
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,470
Where is the photo from?

338
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,920
Of course I took it

339
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,600
Did she come over last night?

340
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,890
Who told you she didn't come over?

341
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,980
As far as I know

342
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,690
Not only did she come to the hospital in the first time,

343
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,430
she stayed with you all night

344
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,860
I took the picture that night

345
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,430
Why didn't you tell me in advance

346
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,990
about such an important matter?

347
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,370
I was on a business trip the next day

348
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,350
Who knows you don't know

349
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,010
Do you still remember this photo?

350
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,320
Exactly

351
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,790
That's you in this picture

352
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,580
No wonder you look so familiar to me

353
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,990
I lost some memories because of some accident

354
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,130
I want to know

355
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,410
what happened on the day

356
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,310
I've remembered

357
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,710
What do you want to ask?

358
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,870
Did she accept my proposal?

359
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,870
No

360
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,390
It seems that she really refused

361
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,270
Refused？

362
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,390
Not yet

363
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,070
The reason I'm so impressed with that day

364
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,510
is that you fainted before your girlfriend

365
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,180
could say yes

366
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,320
to your proposal

367
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,710
Fainted?

368
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,980
What do you want to do?

369
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,270
I've resigned

370
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,460
Is that Nie Xingchen

371
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,690
Yes

372
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,720
Hello

373
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,150
This is Donghong Company

374
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,030
I wonder if you are available for an interview tomorrow

375
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,380
Yeah. Yeah

376
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,510
Then I will send the specific time and address

377
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,480
to you later

378
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,560
Okay

379
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,380
See you tomorrow

380
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,380
Thank you

381
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:48,930
You're welcome

382
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,590
Okay, see you tomorrow

383
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,210
I'm downstairs

384
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,880
What?

385
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,120
What the hell is he up to?

386
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,140
Shall we talk?

387
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,490
I'm not at home now

388
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,810
and I'm busy today

389
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,610
I'll be back late

390
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,420
I'm waiting for you

391
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,040
Who's it?

392
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,880
Take-out

393
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,070
Your take-out

394
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,340
I didn't order

395
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,560
Are you Miss Nie?

396
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:41,790
Yes

397
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,040
The address is correct

398
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:43,950
Here you are

399
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,080
Thank you

400
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,090
Let's eat

401
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,670
Yan Jingzhi

402
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,960
You're breaking and entering

403
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,790
You've been home all the time?

404
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,340
I just got back

405
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,850
Your WeChat showed

406
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,610
there are only forty eight steps

407
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,520
So you didn't go out at all

408
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,490
You're really keeping up with the times

409
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,290
Nie Xingchen

410
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,980
Look at me

411
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,490
What do you want to do?

412
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,950
I made that clear to you last time

413
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,620
Well

414
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,820
We were lovers

415
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,340
But it was five years ago

416
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,780
And I have resigned

417
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,480
From now on,

418
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,960
we'd better treat each other as strangers

419
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,510
Ok?

420
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,350
It's not

421
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,890
up to you

422
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
You were not that badgering before

423
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:37,950
Well

424
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,620
Do you still love me

425
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,030
after you know the truth?

426
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,510
You don't need to irritate me

427
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,580
I just come to ask you about something

428
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,790
What is it?

429
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,650
Why did you lie to me

430
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,240
that you refused my proposal

431
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:50,960
You don't need to argue

432
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,140
I have a witness

433
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,010
Since you have

434
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,010
You should know

435
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,290
I didn't accept your proposal

436
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,790
I fainted at that time

437
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,010
What exactly happened?

438
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,630
Why did you leave without saying a word?

439
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,610
Please tell me

440
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:05,870
At that time

441
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,050
It's long ago

442
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,820
I don't remember

443
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:10,900
Okay

444
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,020
Then I need your help

445
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,250
to remind me of it

446
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,130
Then as you wish,

447
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,030
I won't come to you any more

448
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,280
I'm under no obligation to help you

449
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,930
You are not willing to?

450
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,560
I'm not willing to

451
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,860
I don't think you should

452
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,890
contact with your ex so frequently

453
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,500
That also means respect for your current girlfriend

454
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,230
Right?

455
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,390
You mean Zhen Nian and me

456
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,560
We are just friends

457
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,530
I don't care what your relationship is

458
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,200
It's getting late

459
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,340
I'm going to sleep

460
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,100
Then why did you ask?

461
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,520
You'll change your mind

462
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,190
We'll meet again sooner or later

463
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,450
Remember to have dinner

464
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,240
Hi, my coffee

465
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,020
Here you are

466
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:05,910
Thank you

467
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,770
I didn't pass again

468
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,490
Am I really that unpromising?

469
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,050
Nie Xingchen

470
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,480
I can't be so unpromising

471
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,440
Am I really that unpromising?

472
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:55,970
Miss Nie

473
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,650
It was a pleasure talking with you today

474
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,300
Just go back and wait for notification

475
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,170
Okay

476
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,490
I hope to have the honor to join your company

477
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,890
Hey

478
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,890
She's already been interviewed

479
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,310
Yan Jingzhi

480
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:20,900
It's me

481
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,800
Great

482
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,470
It seems that I have known the result of the interview

483
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,180
Thank you

484
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,720
It's you!

485
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,760
Come in

486
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,140
Please help yourself if you want to drink something

487
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,130
No, thanks

488
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,690
I just come to ask you a question

489
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,760
You've ruined my interview several times

490
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What do you want?

491
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,510
You know what I want

492
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,470
What if I still say No

493
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,550
Then you won't be able to find a job in Jinghai

494
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,250
Even Zhao Yuanfang's recommendation is useless

495
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,030
You...

496
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,270
Okay

497
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,010
You want your memories back, right?

498
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,270
I can do that

499
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,340
But you need to promise me one thing

500
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,910
If my efforts were proved to be useless,

501
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,120
you wouldn't give me a hard time anymore

502
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,350
Even a doctor cannot do it after all

503
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,090
I'm not sure if I can do it

504
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,410
Okay

505
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:34,590
And

506
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,850
Since you asked me to do it,

507
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,620
you must listen to me

508
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,750
No problem

509
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,330
What else do I need to do?

510
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,430
Wait for me downstairs at 7:30 a.m. tomorrow morning

511
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,750
No problem

512
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:47,860
Wait a second

513
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,570
It's for you

514
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,830
No, thanks

515
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,760
It looks like you

516
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,910
Where will we go today?

517
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,410
Follow me

518
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:41,820
Does the

519
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,990
bus help me recover my memory, too

520
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,720
I always thought

521
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,220
you're just an ordinary employee

522
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,980
So we go out by bus all the time

523
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,170
I remember that

524
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,760
you liked it at that time

525
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:13,990
Let's go

526
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,780
Have we really done this before?

527
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,990
Didn't you promise that

528
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,730
you would follow me today?

529
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,150
You are a big boss

530
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,200
Are you frustrated by the wood?

531
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,000
What's this for?

532
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,490
As you like

533
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,750
Use your imagination

534
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,200
Go

535
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,810
Well

536
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,410
Are you impatient already?

537
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,510
What's this?

538
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,440
Key ring

539
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,570
It's a gift for you

540
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,250
Why do we play puzzles?

541
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,120
Each piece of the puzzle has its own place

542
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,550
You can't put it all together once you put it wrong

543
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,350
Just like you and me

544
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,790
This is for me

545
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,270
There are so many couples here

546
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,330
This is a small island in the middle of the river

547
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,150
Every weekend night, fireworks are set off across the river

548
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,450
We used to date here?

549
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,290
Everyone likes free fireworks

550
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,650
If you like it,

551
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,570
I can set off fireworks for you now

552
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,670
Then do I have the honor

553
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,780
to dance with you?

554
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,240
Sure

555
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,800
Is this how we used to go on dates?

556
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,620
Kind of

557
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,650
But there is no music

558
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,130
Morning

559
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:26,920
Tong Xin

560
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,700
Miss Ailu

561
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,080
Why are you sitting in Director Huang's chair?

562
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,840
Is there something wrong with him?

563
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,230
Nothing will happen to him

564
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:33,940
Look

565
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,900
My new fingernails, do they look nice?

566
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,040
We finally took a holiday yesterday

567
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,090
You didn't have a rest

568
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,570
For me,

569
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,060
to make myself beautiful

570
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,900
is also a way to have a rest

571
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,250
I'll share with you. Where have they gone?

572
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,900
Why are you sitting there?

573
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,690
Is there something wrong with Director Huang?

574
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,740
Nothing will happen to him

575
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,330
These are your new limited edition shoes,

576
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,220
right?

577
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,260
I don't know

578
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,620
I've told you so many time

579
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,850
Don't choose the new if you buy fake products

580
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,420
What are you doing here?

581
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,790
What's wrong?

582
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:07,820
I'm late. I'm late

583
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,340
Director Huang

584
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:09,860
Director Huang

585
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,400
What's wrong?

586
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,470
What could have happened?

587
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,420
I'll tell you something

588
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,550
Yesterday I played with my child

589
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,770
in the amusement park for a whole day

590
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,830
I got a stiff neck

591
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,210
It's painful

592
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,370
Let me do massage for you

593
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,100
Amusement park

594
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,970
Didn't you work overtime with the boss?

595
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,110
No...No

596
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,340
He didn't ask me to

597
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,210
Here, here, here

598
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,120
No

599
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,190
He didn't ask me to

600
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,380
I'm screwed

601
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,790
Can't this be the calm before the storm?

602
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,720
What?

603
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,460
No

604
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,050
Pull round

605
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:40,950
Mr. Yan. Mr. Yan

606
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,620
What's wrong?

607
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,240
No...nothing

608
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,250
Guys

609
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,070
Morning

610
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,730
Good morning

611
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:51,990
Mr. Yan

612
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,900
Sorry, I'll submit the

613
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,520
last month's financial statement tomorrow

614
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:58,930
It's Okay

615
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,040
Don't worry

616
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:00,860
Take it easy

617
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,100
I guess there must be something wrong

618
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,900
Did I see something wrong?

619
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,440
The boss gave us a smile?

620
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,580
The boss tapped me on the shoulder just now

621
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,610
saying

622
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,550
don't worry,

623
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,290
take it easy

624
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,690
Typhoon passed through the city last week

625
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,880
It's sunny this week

626
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,580
Is the boss's mood that

627
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,140
capricious

628
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,380
Yeah

629
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,600
I got it

630
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,590
The boss is having problems in his love life

631
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,160
I'm not free tonight

632
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,090
Take a rain check

633
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,610
What's the matter?

634
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,550
Do you need my help?

635
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,650
Another day? When?

636
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,040
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow

637
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,060
Okay

638
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,980
There are no updates in Moments

639
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:23,800
I am blocked?

640
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,220
Mr. Yan

641
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,870
This is the content plan of Quwo for next month

642
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,020
Has Zhao Yuanfang come to the company today?

643
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,660
Mr. Zhao?

644
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,410
It seems he have asked for leave

645
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,160
I heard that from other colleagues of his department

646
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,200
Let me look your phone

647
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,190
I just

648
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,460
want to ask for leave

649
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,100
But I left my phone at home

650
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,940
Call Secretary Tong in

651
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:00,920
Who?

652
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,720
Do you leave your ears at home?

653
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,030
The phone is not important

654
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,040
The phone is not important

655
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,060
But Secretary Tong is important

656
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,900
I...I'll find her right now

657
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,180
I stopped by

658
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,070
and I am coming to take a look

659
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:33,580
No, no, no

660
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,330
I had a dream last night

661
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,680
About us

662
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,780
No, no, no

663
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,490
For recovering memory, I think it's better

664
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,080
to do it at one go

665
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,950
Ok, ok

666
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,110
I'm sure you've heard the saying

667
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,340
Never give up halfway

668
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,550
Who're you?

669
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,900
Er...

670
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,230
Isn't this Nie Xingchen's home?

671
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,830
Mom, who's that?

672
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,830
What are you doing here?

673
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,570
I just stopped by

674
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,300
and I am coming to take a look

675
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,840
You know him?

676
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,230
Er..

677
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,840
My ex-colleague

678
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:25,880
This is my mom

679
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,350
Colleague ah!

680
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,890
Come in, please

681
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,720
Don't bother, auntie, thank you

682
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,500
I

683
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,170
Xingchen

684
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,280
The hand sanitizer was run out

685
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,150
Why you here?

686
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,070
You know each other?

687
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,370
Just in time

688
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,630
Auntie has just cooked dinner

689
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,160
Come in and have some

690
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,890
Have a blast together

691
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,670
Ok, auntie

692
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,200
Come on

693
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,550
Welcome to Jinghai, uncle and auntie

694
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,060
Where do you two want to go tomorrow?

695
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,920
I'll be with you all the way

696
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,330
Thanks a lot

697
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,920
If your work is delayed because of us

698
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,920
We'll be sorry for that

699
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:07,860
No, no, no

700
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,810
Xingchen's parents

701
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,540
are just like my parents

702
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,490
It is more important to accompany my parents

703
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,580
Work is nothing

704
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,250
Zhao is so sweet

705
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,070
Yeah.

706
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,770
Try

707
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,540
These are my specialty dishes

708
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,380
OK, thank you, auntie

709
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,087
I wondered why Xingchen cooks so well

710
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,780
It turns out she learned from you!

711
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
You can't eat spicy food

712
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,290
Have less

713
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,310
It's okay

714
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,500
Zhao, you can't have spicy food

715
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,040
These dishes...

716
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,050
It's okay

717
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:39,750
Spicy food is okay

718
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,610
Very delicious

719
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,090
Auntie has the same skills as a five star chef

720
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,920
Auntie and uncle

721
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,490
I'd like to propose a toast

722
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,620
Come on

723
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,800
You are nice

724
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,430
Thank you

725
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,210
Good tolerance to alcohol

726
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:54,970
Er...

727
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,030
Uncle and auntie

728
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,160
I'd also like to propose a toast

729
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,680
This drink

730
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,870
Don't force yourself to drink

731
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,440
Yan, right?

732
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,580
Don't just drink

733
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,330
Have some food

734
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,880
to relieve the discomfort caused by alcohol

735
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,470
By the way

736
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,810
I just heard you say

737
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,760
you two work together?

738
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,230
Then I want to ask you something

739
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:23,890
Your boss...

740
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,310
Is there something wrong with him?

741
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,360
Mom, have some dishes

742
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,900
You don't interrupt

743
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,780
Xingxing told me

744
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,390
she must get to your boss's home

745
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,900
before 7:30 a.m. every morning

746
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,540
to match clothes for him

747
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,790
and cook breakfast

748
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,120
Aren't those a nanny's job?

749
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,550
More than that

750
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,770
She has to be on call 24 hours a day

751
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,840
without rest for a week

752
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,320
Every time I called her, she always said

753
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,580
Mom, I was working overtime

754
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,170
Why is your boss so fussy?

755
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,310
The reason why secretary Nie is so busy

756
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,830
is that the boss thinks highly of her

757
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,520
Think highly of her, aha!

758
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,020
That is just exploitation

759
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,270
Xingchen worked so hard

760
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,750
If it wasn't that she cannot hold on anymore,

761
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,180
she would not resign

762
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,800
Yeah

763
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,310
She worked for five years

764
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,700
in Zhao's company,

765
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:14,360
right?

766
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,210
Xingxing is a very tenacious girl

767
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,110
She would not resign under no special circumstance

768
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,080
Dad, mom

769
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,180
Shall we have food first?

770
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,110
Xingchen

771
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,600
Please have some more

772
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,410
to nourish your body

773
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,630
You've lost weight these days

774
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,850
Your boss

775
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,310
is really a bad guy

776
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,200
Zhao is right

777
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,300
Please have some more

778
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:32,970
Don't just talk

779
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,310
By the way, Yan

780
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,160
What's your position in the company?

781
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,590
I...

782
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,190
I am...He is my assistant

783
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,220
Assistant ah！

784
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,080
Then it is no wonder

785
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,770
that you still work there

786
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,450
It's improper to speak ill of the boss

787
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,500
I understand that

788
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,220
But I’d like to suggest you

789
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,170
that company

790
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,080
is unpromising

791
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,050
As for the boss...

792
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,250
What's point of following him

793
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:02,380
Unpromising

794
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,010
Come on

795
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:04,960
My daughter

796
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,920
You had a hard time

797
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,130
Have some shrimps

798
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,590
Uncle, uncle

799
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,240
Thanks, dad

800
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,580
Please help yourself

801
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,480
I'll shell shrimps for her

802
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,700
Xingchen, let me help you

803
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,330
Zhao is so sweet

804
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,700
I would like to join

805
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,940
The shrimps today are a little spicy

806
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,970
I just shelled two after such a long time

807
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,100
You are slow

808
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,790
I focus on quality

809
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:17,480
My shrimps are all complete

810
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,270
and look good

811
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,680
Unlike somebody here

812
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,500
who just pursues speed

813
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,930
You have shelled so many

814
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,620
I cannot eat them all

815
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,500
If you do not eat

816
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:34,600
I'll eat them

817
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:35,620
Uncle, please

818
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,620
Uncle, here you are

819
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,210
Give me that

820
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,110
Thank you

821
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:39,680
Thank you

822
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,520
Don't just shell the shrimps

823
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,480
Please have the dishes

824
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:43,700
Come on

825
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,330
You have one, too

826
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,820
These represent children's kindness

827
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,240
Come on

828
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,620
Here's another one for you

829
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,040
Bye, Mr. Yan

830
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:02,580
Don't you leave?

831
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,230
I bought waist supporters for auntie and uncle

832
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,630
I guess they might not be able to use it

833
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,600
So I'll stay and teach them

834
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,010
I'm not like you

835
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,610
Just came in empty-handed

836
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,050
I'll see you down

837
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,830
Bye

838
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,020
I'll remember you

839
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:30,960
Why didn't you tell me that your parents are here?

840
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:33,590
Why would I tell you that?

841
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:35,750
Why did Zhao Yuanfang know that?

842
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,700
I asked him to pick my parents up at the railway station

843
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:39,720
You could call me

844
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:40,570
I could help you, too

845
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:43,240
Mr. Yan

846
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,080
You cross the line

847
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:45,870
Drive safe, be careful

848
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:46,900
Safety first

849
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,250
You cross the line first, don't you?

850
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,070
Yesterday

851
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,960
I just helped you to recover the memory

852
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,690
Why did you kiss me furtively

853
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:55,980
the night you were in the hospital?

854
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,430
You want to deny that?

855
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,190
Nie Xingchen

856
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,550
Can't you be honest?

857
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:02,890
You have feelings for me

858
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:05,720
No. I don't

859
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,870
Why did you kiss me?

860
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,070
To comfort the patient

861
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,520
I just want to tell you

862
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,230
If you want to kiss me next time,

863
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,420
just do it

864
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:16,020
Do it aboveboard

865
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:17,590
I...I

866
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,530
Nie Xingchen

867
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,190
You have feelings for me

868
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,870
Everyone has feelings after being kissed

869
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,680
Don't you?

870
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:12,610
I don't know

871
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,210
I've only kissed one person

872
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,280
You didn't turn me down

873
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,500
I'll take it as a yes

874
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,010
I explained, but you said I was quibbling

875
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,450
I did not explain, but you said I agreed

876
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:26,960
You're such a scoundrel

877
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,590
So you should be careful from now on

878
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:30,120
I'll stick to you

879
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,710
Romeo and Juliet

880
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,560
When love is tested,

881
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,160
it will increase mutual affection

882
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,270
If you refuse again,

883
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,990
it will be an artificial barrier

884
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,490
to increase my affection for you

885
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,830
So it will be my fault if I refuse you?

886
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,000
It's not about right or wrong

887
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,100
It's about method

888
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,970
Then please tell me what should I do

889
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,450
Let it be

890
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,440
I won't force you to be my girlfriend

891
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,900
You don't be in such a hurry to refuse me

892
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,370
Take me as a friend like Zhao Yuanfang

893
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,500
I won't kiss my friends

894
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:03,360
Me, either

895
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:10,610
Indecency

896
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:54,680
Hello

897
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,820
I heard from Director Huang that

898
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,860
you want to check my phone

899
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,620
Except J,

900
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,510
there is nothing in it

901
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,280
Secretary Tong

902
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,130
You misunderstood me

903
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,150
It's not as complicated as you think

904
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,170
Let me ask you a simple question

905
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:11,520
Er...

906
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,470
In your experience of chasing stars

907
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,250
Is there any way you can know

908
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,960
if someone goes out today

909
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,200
Boss

910
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,850
It's simple

911
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,340
Why don't you call and ask?

912
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:25,610
I can't call her

913
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,580
Then you can go to her home

914
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,290
I can't go to her home, either

915
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:31,570
Oh

916
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,345
Boss

917
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,110
There is another simple way

918
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,440
You can check WeChat Movement

919
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,320
If her step number is low,

920
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,410
maybe she didn't go out

921
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,620
If the number is high,

922
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,660
it means she went out

923
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,400
WeChat Movement?

924
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:57,600
She did go out!

925
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,500
Director Huang

926
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,470
32,712

927
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,210
Hello

928
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:10,630
I forget to tell you

929
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,710
The step number can also be faked

930
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,070
Like Director Huang

931
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,560
He tied his phone up to his dog

932
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,910
The dog runs here and there everyday

933
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,570
He takes up the cover of Moments

934
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:20,980
It's so infuriating!

935
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:26,460
Director Huang...
