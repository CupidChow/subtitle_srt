1
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,560
Excuse me. May I ask

2
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,210
which is Yan Jingzhi's room

3
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,810
Sorry

4
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,690
I can't give out customer's information

5
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,710
Forget it

6
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,510
I'll find it myself

7
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,340
Do you want my autograph?

8
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,260
No

9
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,790
Not photo time

10
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,460
Not today

11
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,140
I warn you

12
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,910
I'm calling the police

13
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,860
if you continue following me

14
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,590
Zhen Nian

15
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,040
Where is Yan

16
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,410
Mr. Yan

17
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,860
Since we first met,

18
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,060
you have been asking such questions

19
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,660
What kind of answer do you want exactly

20
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,860
I'd like to know the truth

21
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,010
Is there you

22
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,810
in the memory I lost

23
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,810
I don't know if you have amnesia,

24
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,790
but I'm sure

25
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,160
that you are not

26
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,410
in my memory

27
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,890
Try it and we'd know

28
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,540
What are you doing

29
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,590
Yan Jingzhi

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,660
Leave me alone

31
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,510
What are you doing

32
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,360
Try it and we'd know

33
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,540
Leave me! Yan Jingzhi

34
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,310
Jingzhi

35
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,710
Are you OK?

36
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,940
I wanna go back to my room

37
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:25,940
Go with me

38
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,460
I checked it online

39
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,640
It shows

40
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,540
that this medicine

41
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,590
acts quite fast

42
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,560
How's it going

43
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,140
Much better

44
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,410
Can you be silent

45
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,040
No

46
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,040
So Yan is your...

47
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,240
unforgettable first love

48
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,690
May I keep silence

49
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,360
No

50
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,610
As someone who has pursued you

51
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,640
I have to know who once won me at least

52
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,060
Zhao Yuanfang

53
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,710
Stop that, please

54
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,060
How about...

55
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,740
Some wine?

56
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,210
I'll get it

57
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,890
Don't you have to work today

58
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,240
Why are you here?

59
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,760
Filming site is nearby,

60
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,340
so I came here by the way

61
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,960
I saw Zhao was always looking for Secretary Nie

62
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,760
Are they dating?

63
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,690
As far as I know,

64
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,640
No

65
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,990
You didn’t care about

66
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,610
your employee’s private life before, did you?

67
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,060
Do you think

68
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,560
secretary Nie is a bit like you

69
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,910
Is it?

70
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,140
Why do you think so

71
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,790
Just feelings

72
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:03,940
It's too late today

73
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,210
You can rest here

74
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,910
I'll arrange a room for you

75
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,360
Jingzhi

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,490
May I get your room?

77
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,410
Do you know

78
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,690
why we can't go further

79
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,710
Cause you aren't the owner of this ring

80
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,790
Five years have passed

81
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,210
I have been the only woman beside you for these years

82
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,840
You can't feel nothing about me

83
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,810
When I was in America, I helped you

84
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,960
because I always feel

85
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,340
familiar with you

86
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,960
But now, I'm sure

87
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,390
you are not the one that I'm looking for

88
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,140
Jingzhi

89
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,640
Why would you rather wait for someone,

90
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,810
you doesn't know who it is

91
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,460
rather than give me a chance?

92
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
Because I feel like

93
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,340
I will find her soon

94
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:17,910
So

95
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,110
You are planning to hide this from him

96
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,410
if he can never remember

97
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,790
Anyway, I'm leaving my job soon

98
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,040
Later,

99
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,210
we won't have any contact again

100
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,460
You stay here this month,

101
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,140
is it really for buying house?

102
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:38,810
Not surprising

103
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,640
It's an excuse

104
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,960
You want to stay with him

105
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,140
I just want to know if he's good

106
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,140
So that I can feel relieved to leave

107
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,090
Well said

108
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,740
But you never forget him

109
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,190
I have forgot him yet

110
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,410
Just...

111
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,160
not enough

112
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,610
Nie Xingchen

113
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,140
Why can't you be as decisive as you are at work?

114
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,210
Yan began to suspect something

115
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,560
You'd better tell him the truth

116
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,260
Lead a new life

117
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,440
or end it completely

118
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,440
I'm not in the age of dreaming

119
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,240
We all have to live in reality

120
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,740
Alright, alright

121
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,340
Don't you know about your drinking capability?

122
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,660
Don't you know about my drinking capability?

123
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,540
Keep the secret for me

124
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,440
Hurry, up! Lighter, lighter

125
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,790
Come on and have a look. Does anyone show card?

126
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,660
Yes, Yes

127
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,960
Fine

128
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,260
Come on

129
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,290
This card

130
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,590
This round is Ok, show it, show it

131
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,090
Come on

132
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,610
Please, don't

133
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,260
-I will continue -Just show your cards quicker

134
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,260
Why do you bother that? Come on!

135
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,590
Where is Secretary Nie?

136
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,390
Three Js with two Threes

137
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,010
Skip me

138
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,710
Secretary Nie went out with that Mr. Zhao to entertain

139
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,190
Larger than you

140
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,790
Come on, Come on

141
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,240
Where did they go?

142
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:07,760
I don't know

143
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,490
Go on, go on

144
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,640
Listen well, this one

145
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,110
Dual-three

146
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,340
Who knows I will give him a day of paid holiday!

147
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,090
Paid holiday? Paid holiday?

148
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:16,960
I know

149
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,240
I saw their little videos

150
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,740
Quick! Quick!

151
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,660
Dual K, Dual K

152
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,360
Come on! It's your turn?

153
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,740
Pack up

154
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,090
Go back to company

155
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,740
What about my paid holiday?

156
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,740
How to go back?

157
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,390
NO, NO, NO

158
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,260
Boss is angry

159
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,660
Call Secretary Nie, quick

160
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,840
Something weird

161
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,490
Why does boss put eyes on Secretary Nie so tightly?

162
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,510
What's weird?

163
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,860
Boss is working

164
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,340
Secretary hangs out

165
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,510
Who can be not angry?

166
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,210
Then Xingchen is so unfortunate

167
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,510
I'm so lucky not to be chief secretary

168
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,610
Chief secretary?

169
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,890
You even can't be a good landowner

170
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,810
Just leave

171
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,660
Go! Go! Go!

172
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,240
Boss is already angry

173
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,140
I didn't make it

174
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,140
Hurry up

175
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,510
Why do you hide from me?

176
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,640
You mistook me, Mr. Yan

177
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,760
I am just here for wind

178
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,140
What can I do for you?

179
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,640
I want you to tell me the truth

180
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,090
You know me so well

181
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,840
How can you say you don't know me?

182
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:40,940
It's just

183
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,610
my work

184
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,760
What are you going to do, Mr. Yan?

185
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,940
Continue the things unfinished yesterday

186
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,310
Please hold yourself, Mr. Yan!

187
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,340
Nie Xingchen

188
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,060
Do you need to give me an explanation?

189
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,640
What explanation do you need?

190
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,890
This ring is mine

191
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,440
I was your couple

192
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,140
Mr. Yan

193
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,860
Your distinguishing method

194
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,260
is so haste

195
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,390
If you need,

196
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,340
I can find hundreds of

197
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,910
people to conform to this method

198
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,660
I want true words from you

199
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,260
I have told the truth

200
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,940
We don't know each other

201
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,360
And

202
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,510
I have a boyfriend

203
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,340
Is it?

204
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,640
Where is he?

205
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,240
Here

206
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,890
Mr. Yan

207
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,860
Xingchen is my girlfriend

208
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,910
Please

209
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,790
hold yourself

210
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,010
Now it's time to work

211
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,060
Just the moment you said your words

212
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,290
It's not

213
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,290
Girl friend

214
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,660
What do you want to eat at night?

215
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,810
It's fine

216
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,860
After we arrived at hotel

217
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,240
Thank you

218
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,460
help me get out

219
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,960
But how did you find me up there

220
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,890
Do I need to?

221
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,960
Any time you feel stressed,

222
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,210
don't you like to go to high places?

223
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,860
People don't know about you may think you want to jump down

224
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,090
What's your plan now?

225
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,660
What plan?

226
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,490
Strive for this month

227
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,910
But with your help

228
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,910
Maybe he won't do anything

229
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,940
Yan Jingzhi

230
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,510
is good at attacking you when you are not expected

231
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,440
And he often succeed each time

232
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,110
Just see

233
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,510
Our Yuanda can't be held by him?

234
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,490
How dare you say that? You even...

235
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,390
But just don't wait for

236
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
your welfare house

237
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,210
Just quit

238
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,590
Don't lose more in it

239
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,560
Now I lose both job and woman

240
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
I can't get welfare house

241
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,810
He'll hold me accountable for dismission

242
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,210
I have another way

243
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,990
I give you all I have

244
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,810
We go to marry now

245
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,240
Law can protect us

246
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,240
You can't keep serious for more than five minutes

247
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,110
Who's not serious?

248
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,340
See

249
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,860
It's two hours before the civil affairs bureau closes

250
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,990
There's still time for us to go home and get the family account

251
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,060
Bro

252
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,510
We have been out for two days

253
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,340
Just go home and rest, OK?

254
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,540
After now you will never get the time again

255
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,310
You will not get me this good husband

256
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,810
Something's wrong with you today?

257
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,560
You're so impatient today

258
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,760
Keep busy all day

259
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,010
Still so vigorous

260
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,590
This is the symptoms of bipolar disease

261
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,190
I advise you to check at psychiatry department

262
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,190
What happened to you?

263
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,960
Company broke out?

264
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,390
Or you were fired by the board?

265
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,440
Tell me

266
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,410
I can make a psychological counseling for you

267
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,210
You seems not to graduate from psychology

268
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,610
But enough for counseling work

269
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,540
What do you think of me?

270
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,540
or

271
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,640
With my condition,

272
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,360
what's my rank

273
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,310
on the list of men in your heart?

274
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,860
Though I'm a little bit afraid of women

275
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,940
I have no interest in men

276
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,610
Have fun, I'm leaving

277
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,590
Where is Dr. Han?

278
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,760
What's going on?

279
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,510
Why isn't he here yet?

280
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,360
Yeah

281
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,210
He hasn't come yet

282
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,660
Dr. Han?

283
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,510
Hi, uncle, aunt

284
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,340
Are you also waiting for Dr. Han?

285
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,190
Yeah

286
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,460
He just finished an operation

287
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,590
and may need a while to be here

288
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,040
Don't worry

289
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,140
I will wait with you

290
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,440
Okay

291
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,360
Here comes Dr. Han

292
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,260
Here he is, look

293
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,360
The one over there

294
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,840
The patience's condition is

295
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,990
basically stable now

296
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,860
Don't worry

297
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,840
The one in white is Dr. Han

298
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,940
Soon the patience is able to be discharged from hospital

299
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:39,890
OK

300
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,910
Here's the medical record card

301
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,310
Is there anything we should pay attention to after leaving the hospital?

302
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,660
I'm dying, I'm dying

303
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,440
The hardworking man is

304
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,110
killing me with his charm

305
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,710
About the diet, a light diet is recommended

306
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,960
Do not eat fried and spicy food

307
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,340
Young as Dr. Han

308
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,490
Is he reliable in surgery?

309
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,140
Yeah

310
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,610
Perhaps we could change him into an older

311
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,410
and more experienced doctor

312
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:57,990
Why not?

313
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,140
Uncle, aunt

314
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,360
Dr. Han is an excellent Ph.D.

315
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,260
graduated from Jinghai University

316
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,010
And he is the youngest chief doctor of the city

317
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,590
You cannot deny his ability simply because

318
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,190
he is young

319
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,260
or deny his record of zero failure because of

320
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,610
the lack of knowledge of him

321
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,540
He's so young

322
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,210
How many operations could he have done?

323
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,790
Such distrust of him will

324
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,340
deeply affect

325
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,810
his career

326
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,110
You go first

327
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,640
What an interesting young lady!

328
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,660
I don't even know you

329
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,460
Let's go

330
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,190
I haven't finished yet

331
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,190
Dr. Han is really an excellent doctor

332
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,260
Please don't

333
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,960
What's wrong?

334
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,160
Dr. Han

335
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,210
I'm fine

336
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,490
Just work at ease

337
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,990
Leave me with any other questions

338
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,310
Are you the secretary of Jingzhi?

339
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,810
That's right

340
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,640
Yeah, but I am also the president of your fan club

341
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,790
Fan club?

342
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,860
What kind of fan club?

343
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,260
The club that cheer for you

344
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,240
quietly support you

345
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,140
and protect you

346
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,440
But don't you worry

347
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,010
I am definitely not a ''celebrity stalker''

348
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,610
And I won't interrupt your work at all

349
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,810
Did you hit your head last time?

350
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,590
I

351
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,010
No I'm mentally healthy

352
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,940
Then do you have any relatives who want to see me for surgery?

353
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,110
No

354
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,310
I see

355
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,510
You want me to say good words for you to in front of Jingzhi

356
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,840
Sorry!

357
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,810
I can't do that

358
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,660
Of course not

359
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,540
Dr. Han

360
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,640
Professional fans

361
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,690
support their idols unconditionally

362
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,990
Then what for?

363
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,810
Because...

364
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,260
you are a very good doctor

365
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,060
Thanks

366
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,790
You're welcome

367
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,160
See you， Dr. Han

368
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,340
Come on

369
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,340
Are you sure you are just in the bar for a glass of water?

370
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,940
I drink water

371
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,890
Boring

372
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,110
Mr. Zhao, you asked me out to the bar

373
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,540
Aren't you supposed to talk about business?

374
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,440
It is business

375
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,260
also private

376
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,790
If I knew that when you acquired Yuanda back then

377
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,660
for the sake of Xingchen

378
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,760
I wouldn't agree on it

379
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,310
Regret now?

380
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,190
Regret now?

381
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,140
Xingchen is my girlfriend,

382
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,640
and from now to the future,

383
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,590
she will not have any intersection with you

384
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,640
So you are wasting your time if you keep doing this

385
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,790
Want to make a deal with me?

386
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,760
Yeah

387
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,190
Yeah, this is the

388
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,760
remaining 20 percent of the shares of Yuanda I hold

389
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,760
I ask for nothing

390
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,360
but the freedom of Xingchen

391
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,790
It's a good deal for you

392
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,690
Whether it's good or not

393
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,440
is none of your business

394
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,910
See you

395
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,160
200 million

396
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,290
Oh my God

397
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,390
Can you do some work

398
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,910
instead of drinking water all day?

399
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,990
OK, sure

400
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,540
How diligent you are

401
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,390
Mr. Zhao

402
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,710
Hello, Mr. Zhao

403
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,140
I bought you guys something

404
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,610
to thank you for

405
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,840
taking care of Xingchen

406
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,490
Make yourselves at home

407
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,310
and help yourselves

408
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,360
Thank you, Mr. Zhao

409
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,290
Mr. Zhao

410
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,090
You treat us well

411
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:34,590
It's fine

412
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,490
It's such a blessing to be your staff

413
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,810
No! No! No!

414
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,140
Xingchen is

415
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,790
not only my employee

416
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,860
She is also my...

417
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,140
also

418
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,090
Girlfriend

419
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,810
Mr. Zhao

420
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,840
Xingchen

421
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,510
Welcome

422
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,140
Don't say anything about it

423
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,940
Mr. Zhao

424
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,440
I have work to report to you

425
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,010
Go with me

426
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,960
Have to go now

427
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,940
Help yourselves

428
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,860
He has just acquiesced the fact Xingchen is his girlfriend

429
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,860
No way!

430
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:09,990
No

431
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,990
But Xingchen never admitted it

432
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,110
Hey dude

433
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,590
Being too naive is also some kind of illness

434
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,760
How childish he is

435
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,260
Indeed, come on everybody

436
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,940
Come on

437
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,610
It's such a rare thing to have you in my office

438
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,240
Come and have a seat

439
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,590
I'll give you a good treat

440
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,260
What kind of tea would you like to drink?

441
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,860
I will pour you

442
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,620
No thanks

443
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,890
-I really have to talk with Mr. Zhao for work -Mr. Zhao

444
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,140
Mr. Yan

445
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,460
Mr. Yan, what bring you here to my office?

446
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,760
To find my own secretary

447
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,240
I have to come to your office

448
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,460
It seems that Mr. Zhao's charm is so great

449
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,540
Not bad

450
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,810
Mr. Yan

451
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,990
Mr. Yan, what can I do for you?

452
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,110
I cannot care less your private relationship

453
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,210
But your only identity in the company

454
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,340
is my secretary

455
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:52,790
So

456
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,440
My interests come first over everything

457
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,160
Mr. Yan

458
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,310
The live streaming of Quwo APP is coming soon

459
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,290
At work

460
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,460
As your secretary

461
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,240
It's my duty to supervise

462
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,090
the work of various departments

463
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,290
In private

464
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,090
I'm the one who knows Quwo the best

465
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,260
It's also my duty as a secretary to discuss with Mr. Zhao

466
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,160
the promotional Plan

467
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:16,760
So

468
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,590
Any result?

469
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,810
We want to invite

470
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,460
a star who is in line with Quwo's position

471
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,810
as the Promotion Ambassador

472
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,890
Who?

473
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,010
Zhen Nian

474
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:32,890
OK

475
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,340
Zhen Nian

476
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,940
Mr. Yan!

477
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,890
You are completely pulling strings about this matter

478
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,490
It's you who chose her

479
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,690
Secretary Nie will follow up this matter

480
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,640
Look

481
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,590
It seems that

482
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,790
his relationship with Zhen Nian is delicate

483
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,740
Maybe

484
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,260
Not only on the bright side

485
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,910
but also on the sly

486
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,590
Alright

487
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,060
Memories come back?

488
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,360
I will go with you

489
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,710
if you want

490
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,240
Thanks

491
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,840
I can handle it myself

492
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,410
See you

493
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,290
A stubborn one with

494
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,310
a silly one

495
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,840
What a match!

496
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,410
Miss Zhen

497
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,510
My apologies, Miss Nie

498
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,660
I just finished my announcement

499
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,610
No worries, please have a seat

500
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,910
This is the introduction of Quwo App

501
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,610
We'd like to invite you

502
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,040
as our promotion ambassador of the live video sector

503
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,810
Do you find it interested to you?

504
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,790
My agency has never accepted any

505
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,160
endorsement of softwares

506
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,110
Let alone a promotion ambassador

507
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,690
If even I agree

508
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,440
it's not easy to explain to my company

509
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,690
I understand your concerns

510
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,160
As long as you are okay with this matter

511
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,810
I will communicate with your company

512
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,390
Secretary Nie

513
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,860
I won't hide the truth from you since

514
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,160
you are the secretary of Jingzhi

515
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,110
To be honest

516
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,140
My greatest concern is that

517
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,840
it will affect your company's promotion after

518
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,860
I get married and having a baby

519
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,410
even the whole brand image

520
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,910
It's so difficult

521
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,760
There is no need for anxiety

522
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,910
I will go back and discuss with the lawyer

523
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,140
to write the relevant clauses in the contract

524
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,390
That will be great

525
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,560
I don't want to affect the normal operation of your company

526
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,390
because of my relationship with Jingzhi

527
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,940
Sorry, I need to take this call

528
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,710
OK

529
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,240
Hi, Jingzhi

530
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,510
Are you about to arrive?

531
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:50,610
Okay, waiting

532
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,310
Bye-bye

533
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:53,940
Miss Zhen

534
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,210
Have to go back to the company

535
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,510
I'll contact you when the contract is confirmed

536
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,660
OK

537
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,140
Jingzhi

538
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,610
You are fast

539
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,310
Did you meet with Miss Nie just now?

540
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,440
Yeah, she talked with me about the promotion ambassador matter

541
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,060
But...

542
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,410
Is everything okay between you two?

543
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,360
What's wrong?

544
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,260
It seems she doesn't want to see you

545
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,160
and rushed out when she learnt that you were coming

546
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,510
Don't you mention that you have work to talk about with me?

547
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,540
What's wrong with you?

548
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,290
I cannot meet you except for work?

549
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,640
Can I just ask a friend out for dinner?

550
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,060
Go

551
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,640
Okay

552
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,410
Our press conference today for Quwo

553
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,040
is over now

554
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,740
Thank you for your attention

555
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,410
Next, all guests are invited to leave in an orderly manner

556
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,010
Thanks

557
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,840
Thank you

558
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,690
Hello, Zhen Nian

559
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,410
I'd like to interview you about

560
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,790
your felling

561
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,590
Thanks

562
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,260
Thank you so much

563
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,310
So many people showed up at the press conference today

564
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,460
I really had a great time

565
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,660
Mr. Yan

566
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:24,810
Mr. Yan

567
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,340
Mr. Yan, the press conference is very successful

568
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,710
Data statistics shows that

569
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,910
during the press conference

570
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,740
our network-wide user penetration rate

571
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,440
ranked No. 3

572
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,910
And there are three hundred thousand new users

573
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,190
Except for work

574
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,710
Is there anything else that you want to tell me?

575
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,510
No

576
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,840
Then why are you hiding from me?

577
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,710
I'm working on the handover of my work lately

578
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,410
It's normal that you cannot see me frequently

579
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,190
I think

580
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,560
I think we can further discuss this matter

581
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,940
I think it's' not necessary

582
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,910
You don't believe me anyway

583
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,810
That is because you cannot

584
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,190
self-justify what you said in most cases

585
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,740
Mr. Yan, if you must do this，

586
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,410
I will have to consider leaving in advance

587
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,660
Wish you and Miss Zhen happiness

588
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,010
That's all for today

589
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,710
OK

590
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,590
Thank you for your hard work

591
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,890
The same to you

592
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,140
Miss Zhen

593
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,910
I didn't have time to say hello last time

594
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,410
I'm Zhao Yuanfang

595
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,660
Hi， Mr. Zhao

596
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,190
The press conference was a success

597
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,810
Thank you for your effort

598
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Not at all

599
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,460
It's all dedicated to Xingchen

600
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,590
You should thank her

601
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,240
Miss Zhen

602
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,140
Stop looking!

603
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,560
They are gone

604
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:40,940
To whom to show your sorrow?

605
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,360
If you feel upset

606
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,260
I will have several more drinks with you at the cocktail party

607
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,490
I don't think Mr. Zhao

608
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,860
would be a gallant man

609
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,640
I'm not that kind of person

610
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,090
You can understand it as

611
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,460
I'm trying to please the future proprietress

612
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,010
The party will begin soon

613
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,810
If the spokesperson doesn't go,

614
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,210
I can be shameless

615
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,010
But Bojue are keen on face-saving

616
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:11,810
You!

617
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,410
Good morning! Mr. Yan

618
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,690
How could it be you

619
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,360
Xingchen has a bad cold and asked for leave

620
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,760
She arranged me to cover for her

621
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,290
Mr. Yan

622
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,340
Did I choose the wrong one

623
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,790
Mr. Yan, What about breakfast?

624
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,460
No, thanks

625
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,810
Who?

626
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,710
Express delivery

627
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,810
Put it outside

628
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,640
I'll take it later

629
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,710
Well, it's on the ground

630
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,360
OK, thanks

631
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,240
Mr. Yan

632
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,010
Please come in

633
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,660
Your express

634
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,710
Mr. Yan

635
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,090
How could you come to my house

636
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,490
I'm here for reconcile with you

637
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,110
The thing that I mistook you for someone else

638
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,810
will not happen again

639
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,490
and I hope you don't hide from me

640
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:21,490
By the way,

641
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,560
Finding someone to take over your job

642
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,660
will take some time

643
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,410
I hope you cooperate

644
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,310
Mr. Yan, thank you for always understand my difficulties

645
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,540
and I believe

646
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,260
we can enjoy

647
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,740
the rest of our working time

648
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,440
Sit down please

649
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,560
Have a glass of water

650
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,390
Mr. Yan

651
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,740
Mr. Yan

652
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,240
Eh

653
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,940
Ah

654
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,690
Just so busy these days

655
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,540
It's usually cleaned

656
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,490
Clean up quickly

657
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,160
Yes, Mr. Yan

658
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,460
Eh

659
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,490
Why so much hair on the sink

660
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,560
Secretary Nie

661
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,440
Mr. Yan

662
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,060
Where girls live,

663
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,510
there must be a lot of hair

664
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,360
Really

665
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,610
Then your hair volume is really sufficient

666
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,990
Thank you for praise, Mr. Yan

667
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,440
Clean up quickly!

668
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,210
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

669
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,140
All right, Mr. Yan

670
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,210
No, Mr. Yan

671
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,940
I took a day off at home

672
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,190
I can't follow your standards

673
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,160
to treat you

674
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,890
Give me a pair of gloves

675
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,490
Secretary Nie

676
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,740
Yan Jingzhi

677
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,490
Secretary Nie looks

678
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,040
different today

679
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,890
Thanks to you, Mr. Yan

680
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,410
I can't find anything in my house

681
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,340
I just put everything in a reasonable place

682
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,310
My house is a mess

683
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,790
But has its unique order

684
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:18,990
You tide it all up

685
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,260
My hair loop

686
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,210
is lost

687
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,160
It should be on the bathroom cabinet

688
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,190
in a purple bag

689
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,590
Six purple hair rings and

690
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,510
eight black hair rings

691
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,140
Two...

692
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,940
Mr. Yan, please don't come here without invitation

693
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,740
My boyfriend will get annoyed

694
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,790
You mean Zhao Yuanfang?

695
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,240
Does he often go to your house

696
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,110
When was the last time he went to your house

697
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,340
Did he stay?

698
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,610
Did you drink?

699
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,440
What kind of wine?

700
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,740
Is he on the sofa or on the bed

701
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,690
Sleep left or right

702
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,590
It's our private business

703
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,110
Someone who has a lover

704
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,840
usually have a track in each other's lives

705
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,960
But in your house

706
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,540
I can't find any trace of man

707
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,460
So

708
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:10,140
don't use this fake boyfriend's lie to perfunctory me

709
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,490
I

710
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,460
A lying child's nose

711
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,990
will grow longer

712
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,690
So handsome

713
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,310
You...

714
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,940
Good morning, Xingchen

715
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,140
Miss Xingchen

716
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,610
Your video gone viral

717
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,560
Come and see

718
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:54,860
Come on

719
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,310
On the press conference,

720
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,640
you use the company's account to broadcast live

721
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,490
and you filmed our boss in the last few seconds

722
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:00,740
So

723
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,090
Look at the number of clicks

724
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,640
Good

725
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:11,940
More than that

726
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,490
It also on the hot search list of today

727
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,360
He is so handsome

728
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,310
Really handsome

729
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,560
What are you guys looking at?

730
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,760
This is my private domain

731
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,110
If you want to see those trash,

732
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,460
go to your own place

733
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,010
Director Huang

734
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,740
Secretary Nie is here, too

735
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,040
And

736
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,160
Just now

737
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,860
The Publicity Department

738
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,610
submitted a publicity plan

739
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,390
We should reply it as soon as possible

740
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,390
Publicity plan

741
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,210
Shoot the daily life of the CEO

742
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,760
Really? really?

743
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,140
I don't think this is a good idea

744
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,840
What's wrong with that

745
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,360
Secretary Nie

746
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,410
According to the analysis of our Marketing Department

747
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,890
The video you shot this time

748
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,210
become a hot video online

749
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,060
If you keep shooting,

750
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,810
it will be good for broadcasting our company

751
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,040
And

752
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,240
It's very conductive

753
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,010
to the brand building of our company

754
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,110
Yes, Xingchen

755
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,390
It is a big trend now

756
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,790
If our boss can really show his life online every day,

757
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,210
it will attract a lot of die-hard fan

758
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,360
and they will help us

759
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,710
make promotion

760
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,790
It is a free promotion

761
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:18,140
What are the key words of today's hot search on Weibo

762
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,640
So handsome, honey

763
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,560
Cancel this plan

764
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,490
Mr. Yan doesn't like public private life

765
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,390
Let the Publicity Department submit another plan

766
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,140
Yeah

767
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:35,710
Let us think about it together

768
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,790
Any other better suggestions?

769
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,340
Let's get busy. Okay. Yeah

770
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,060
Speak

771
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,190
Secretary Nie

772
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,810
You seem to have taken the wrong seat

773
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:00,840
I'm so sorry!

774
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,510
Secretary Nie

775
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,790
If Mr. Yan doesn't want to shoot,

776
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,490
you can film me

777
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,290
My wife always says I'm so handsome, Tong Xin

778
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:12,010
Would you lend me that rope

779
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,760
Fine

780
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,240
It's me on the screen

781
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,460
Mr. Yan

782
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,860
I accidentally recorded the video

783
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:45,460
It turned out to go viral online

784
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:58,690
Where does this handsome guy in comics come from

785
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,010
With his appearance,

786
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,690
his company can become one of the world's top five hundred

787
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,110
Tired of being a cute girl,

788
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,410
I just want to be his wife

789
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,290
My honey is the kind of person

790
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,390
who are hotter than the outside air conditioner in summer

791
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,290
They're talking about me?

792
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:12,810
Yeah

793
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:13,760
What do they call me?

794
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,940
Honey

795
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,440
You play Sudoku, too

796
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,340
Since you have time

797
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,540
Why not finish that

798
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,890
You mix pitaya with strawberry yogurt?

799
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:16,860
Secretary Nie

800
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,690
What a rich taste!

801
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,260
Mr. Yan, you are violating my privacy

802
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,390
Can you do what a boss should do

803
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,610
Then don't regard me as a boss

804
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,040
but think of me as an ordinary man

805
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,390
I have to work now

806
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,840
A toothbrush?

807
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,740
No man's clothes

808
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,290
No man

809
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,110
No Zhao Yuanfang
